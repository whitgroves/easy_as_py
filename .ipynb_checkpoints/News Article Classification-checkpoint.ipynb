      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\nWhat’s Really Missing From the New iPhone: Dazzle\\xa0Forget about the headphone jack for a second.\\xa0Sure, it’s pretty annoying that Apple’s newest iPhones — the 7 and 7 Plus, which were unveiled in San Francisco on Wednesday and will start shipping to customers on Sept. 16 — will not include a port for plugging in standard earbuds. But you’ll get used to it.\\xa0The absence of a jack is far from the worst shortcoming in Apple’s latest product launch. Instead, it’s a symptom of a deeper issue with the new iPhones, part of a problem that afflicts much of the company’s product lineup: Apple’s aesthetics have grown stale.\\xa0Apple has squandered its once-commanding lead in hardware and software design. Though the new iPhones include several new features, including water resistance and upgraded cameras, they look pretty much the same as the old ones. The new Apple Watch does too. And as competitors have borrowed and even begun to surpass Apple’s best designs, what was iconic about the company’s phones, computers, tablets and other products has come to seem generic.\\xa0This is a subjective assessment, and it’s one that Apple rebuts.Yet there are signs that my critique of Apple’s designs are shared by others. Industrial designers and tech critics used to swoon over Apple’s latest hardware; nowadays you witness less swooning and more bemusement.And while Apple has slowed its design cadence, its rivals have sped up. Last year Samsung remade its lineup of Galaxy smartphones in a new glass-and-metal design that looked practically identical to the iPhone. Then it went further. Over the course of a few months, Samsung put out several design refinements, culminating in the Note 7, a big phone that has been universally praised by critics. With its curved sides and edge-to-edge display, the Note 7 pulls off a neat trick: Though it is physically smaller than Apple’s big phone, it actually has a larger screen. So thanks to clever design, you get more from a smaller thing — exactly the sort of advance we once looked to Apple for.\\n\\n\\nAmazon Cuts Delivery Times in Threat to Alibaba, EBay, Wish.com:\\xa0Amazon.com Inc. is speeding the delivery of USB cables, smartphone screen protectors, cosmetics and other small, flat items in its continuing push against rival marketplaces that help overseas manufacturers and suppliers sell directly to U.S. shoppers. \\xa0The Seattle-based company notified merchants Wednesday that such items would now be delivered to Amazon Prime members within five business days, down from eight previously, according to an e-mail obtained by Bloomberg. That makes Amazon delivery of small, inexpensive items from China, for example, much faster than the two weeks to 30 days it can take using marketplaces owned by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., EBay Inc. and Wish.com.\\xa0Amazon wants quick delivery, which has helped it dominate online shopping in the U.S., to further differentiate itself from competitors in cross-border e-commerce. U.S. online shoppers will spend about $30 billion this year on cross-border transactions, a 10 percent increase from 2015, with China the leading source of goods purchased, according to a February report byEMarketer.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nOfferUp raises $119 million for resale marketplace:\\xa0It’s like Craigslist, but with auctions. OfferUp is an app that makes it easy to buy and sell your goods.\\xa0The fast-growing Seattle-based company is raising $119 million to continue its global expansion and continue hiring. The round is led by Warburg Pincus and includes funding from GGV Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and T. Rowe Price.\\xa0OfferUp users snap a photo of their used items like clothing and furniture and then check the app to sort through the highest bids. The built-in messaging feature also makes it easy to communicate with prospective buyers.\\xa0Hans Tung from GGV Capital said that he invested in OfferUp because “Craigslist hasn’t innovated for a long time and there is unmet, pent up demand for classified on mobile.” He points out that OfferUp makes it easy to communicate with prospective buyers, without having to share one’s personal cell phone number.\\xa0OfferUp launched just last year and already has 29 million installations in the U.S. They claim that their user engagement rivals Snapchats.I personally tried OfferUp last fall when I was selling items before a cross-country move. I was surprised to see how easy it was to find bidders for seemingly undesirable things, including my used trash can!\\xa0OfferUp previously raised over $91 million in funding.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter a quiet summer, Twitter’s board will take a hard look at what comes next:\\xa0Twitter’s quiet summer may soon be coming to an end.\\xa0The social communication company’s board of directors is set to meet this Thursday in San Francisco, and there are plenty of things to discuss. That includes, said sources, its fate as a standalone company.\\xa0That’s no surprise, since Twitter has been the subject of numerous takeover and acquisition rumors over the last few months, each one sending the stock up as investors hold out hope that Twitter will find a buyer.\\xa0There are the big corporate names that might take another close look at Twitter, such as Google (there’s an unusual scenario one source mentioned in which it becomes part of some Alphabet media spinoff), Apple and even media mogul Rupert Murdoch, either via 21st Century Fox or News Corp. Other possible bidders include private equity firms that may want to take the company private, where it can solve some of its issues out of the public eye.\\xa0But finding a buyer won’t be easy, given the Twitter’s estimated cost. Using the same multiple LinkedIn got from Microsoft in its recent $26 billion acquisition deal, a Twitter buyer would have to fork over about $18 billion. That’s a steep price tag for a company that has had persistent issues with growth and also one that is still losing money each quarter.\\n\\n\\nPostmates is raising at least $100 million to fuel its on-demand ambitions:\\xa0We’re hearing from sources that Postmates, which is among a few companies that are seen as operating in the difficult on-demand space, is raising at least $100 million in a round led by Founders Fund. Sources stressed that the round has not closed, and that things may change over time.\\xa0Despite the challenges of working in an on-demand economy — which can sometimes lead to punishing gross margins and high operational costs — we’ve heard that Postmates is actually in okay shape. Some leaked financial documents earlier obtained by TechCrunch dated last year highlighted gross margins of around 20%. Postmates’ CEO Bastian Lehmann has said before that the company is on track to hit profitability in 2017 — which, at the time we reviewed the leaked documents, we also heard was on track.The company is operating in an area of steep competition with the likes of DoorDash, which recently raised $127 million in a down round. That moment was somewhat of a microcosm of the financing environment at the time: DoorDash sought a valuation of $1 billion, but inevitably had to settle for something lower. However, in Postmates’ situation, we hear that this round is not a down round. The company last raised $80 million at a round that valued it at nearly $500 million. Obviously this is good news for Postmates.\\n\\n\\nA look at three players in the 3D printing world:\\xa0Carbon is backed by notable investors, including Google, Autodesk and Sequoia Capital as the company managed to raise $141 million to date. Their debut printer, the M1, is priced at $40,000 per year with a minimum three-year term — a subscription-based model that is quite new to the 3D printing industry. After a decade’s worth of research and development, and $25 million in funding from Autodesk and Catalyst, XJet revealed its technology at RAPID 2016 in May. The company now has seven machines operating in its Rehovot, Israel HQ, but is yet to announce an official launch date and its first product. Once on the market, XJet could potentially disrupt the production of short-runs of complex metal parts in major areas of production.Offering an end-to-end solution for $155,000, HP’s machine is priced rather competitively. Currently there’s only one available material (nylon), but the company is planning to roll out more materials in the coming months, showing vast potential for future development.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow Uber Drivers Decide How Long to Work:\\xa0For nearly 20 years, economists have been debating how cabdrivers decide when to call it a day. This may seem like a trivial question, but it is one that cuts to the heart of whether humans are fundamentally rational — in this case, whether they earn their incomes efficiently — as the discipline has traditionally assumed.\\xa0In one camp is a group of so-called behavioral economists who have found evidence that many taxi drivers work longer hours on days when business is slow and shorter hours when business is brisk — the opposite of what economic rationality, to say nothing of common sense, would seem to dictate.\\xa0So who is right? That’s where Uber comes in. When one of the company’s researchers, using its supremely detailed data on drivers’ work time and rides, waded into the debate with a paper this year, the results were intriguing.\\xa0Over all, there was little evidence that drivers were driving less when they could make more per hour than usual. But that was not true for a large portion of new drivers. Many of these drivers appeared to have an income goal in mind and stopped when they were near it, causing them to knock off sooner when their hourly wage was high and to work longer when their wage was low.Whatever the case, the result seems to have one very obvious implication: Anyone trying to make it in the gig economy should probably pick a favorite platform or two and stick with them rather than constantly jump around from one type of gig to another.\\n\\n\\n\\nGoodbye, Ivory Tower. Hello, Silicon Valley Candy Store.\\xa0Silicon Valley is turning to the dismal science in its never-ending quest to squeeze more money out of old markets and build new ones. In turn, the economists say they are eager to explore the digital world for fresh insights into timeless economic questions of pricing, incentives and behavior.\\xa0“It’s an absolute candy store for economists,” Mr. Coles said.\\xa0The pay, of course, is a lot better than you would find in academia, where economists typically earn $125,000 to $150,000 a year. In tech companies, pay for a Ph.D. economist will usually come in at more than $200,000 a year, the companies say. With bonuses and stock grants, compensation can easily double in a few years. Senior economists who manage teams can make even more.\\xa0Businesses have been hiring economists for years. Usually, they are asked to study macroeconomic trends — topics like recessions and currency exchange rates — and help their employers deal with them.\\xa0But what the tech economists are doing is different: Instead of thinking about national or global trends, they are studying the data trails of consumer behavior to help digital companies make smart decisions that strengthen their online marketplaces in areas like advertising, movies, music, travel and lodging.\\xa0Tech outfits including giants like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoftand up-and-comers like Airbnb and Uber hope that sort of improved efficiency means more profit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSatellite owner says SpaceX owes $50 million or free flight:\\xa0Israel\\'s Space Communication Ltd said on Sunday it could seek $50 million or a free flight from Elon Musk\\'s SpaceX after a Spacecom communications satellite was destroyed last week by an explosion at SpaceX\\'s Florida launch site.\\xa0Officials of the Israeli company said in a conference call with reporters Sunday that Spacecom also could collect $205 million from Israel Aerospace Industries, which built the AMOS-6 satellite.\\xa0SpaceX said in an email to Reuters that it does not disclose contract or insurance terms. The company is not public, and it has not said what insurance it had for the rocket or to cover launch pad damages beyond what was required by the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees commercial U.S. launches, for liability and damage to government property.\\xa0SpaceX has more than 70 missions on its manifest, worth more than $10 billion, for commercial and government customers.\\xa0The space launch company is one of three major transportation and energy enterprises Musk leads. The others are electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc and SolarCity Corp, and Musk faces separate challenges at each of those money losing companies.\\xa0Spacecom has been hit hard in the aftermath of the Thursday explosion that destroyed the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and its payload. The Israeli company said the loss of the satellite would have a significant impact, with its equity expected to decline by $30 million to $123 million.\\xa0Spacecom shares dropped 9 percent on Thursday, with the explosion occurring late in the last trading day of the week.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpaceX Rocket Explodes at Launchpad in Cape Canaveral - Destroying Facebook Satellite:\\xa0A spectacular explosion of a SpaceX rocket on Thursday destroyed a $200 million communications satellite that would have extended Facebook’s reach across Africa, dealing a serious setback to Elon Musk, the billionaire who runs the rocket company.\\xa0The blast is likely to disrupt NASA’s cargo deliveries to the International Space Station, exposing the risks of the agency’s growing reliance on private companies like SpaceX to carry materials and, soon, astronauts.\\xa0The explosion, at Cape Canaveral, Fla., intensified questions about whether Mr. Musk is moving too quickly in his headlong investment in some of the biggest and most complex industries, not just space travel but carmakers and electric utilities.\\xa0This is not the first problem Mr. Musk has suffered as he tries to create space travel that is cheap and commonplace. Each of his companies, including Tesla and SolarCity, has hit major stumbling blocks recently. Theowner of a Tesla car died in May in a crash using the company’s autopilot software, and SolarCity faces major financial challenges. The explosion was particularly painful news for Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, who is touring Kenya, promoting a program reliant on the satellite, known as Amos-6, with entrepreneurs in the country. He had promised them connectivity. Just hours after the news of the explosion broke, Mr. Zuckerberg expressed disappointment on his Facebook page “that SpaceX’s launch failure destroyed our satellite,” a swipe at Mr. Musk and his team, who were still trying to figure out what went wrong.\\n\\n\\nGoogle shelves plan for phone with interchangeable parts - sources:\\xa0Alphabet Inc’s Google has suspended Project Ara, its ambitious effort to build what is known as a modular smartphone with interchangeable components, as part of a broader push to streamline the company\\'s hardware efforts, two people with knowledge of the matter said.\\xa0The move marks an about-face for the tech company, which announced a host of partners for Project Ara at its developer conference in May and said it would ship a developer edition of the product this autumn.\\xa0The company’s aim was to create a phone that users could customize on the fly with an extra battery, camera, speakers or other components.Axing Project Ara is one of the first steps in a campaign to unify Google’s various hardware efforts, which range from Chromebook laptops to Nexus phones. Former Motorola president Rick Osterloh rejoined Google earlier this year to oversee the effort. Google sold Motorola Mobility to Lenovo Group in 2014.“This was a science experiment that failed, and they are moving on,” he said.\\xa0Project Ara was one of the flagship efforts of Google’s Advanced Technology and Projects group, which aims to develop new devices, but it had various stops and starts.\\xa0Last year, the company shelved plans to sell the modular phone in Puerto Rico with Latin American carriers.\\n\\n\\nWhen Things Go Very Wrong at a Start-Up:\\xa0For many young engineers and business people, Silicon Valley is their version of Hollywood. If you want to make it big, go there, create your own company or sign on with a start-up on the way up, and get ready to make a fortune. Maybe you will even become famous.\\xa0But Hollywood, it turns out, is not the only California destination with a boulevard of broken dreams.\\xa0Last week, a Medium post about how things went south — badly — at an unnamed tech start-up drew attention to a side of Silicon Valley not many people talk about. For all the Googles and Facebooks and Oracles, there may be hundreds of companies that never make it. And in some cases, the employees who sign on may walk away poorer financially for their effort.\\xa0As Katie Benner writes, it wasn’t long before online commenters figured out that the company in the Medium post was called WrkRiot. The unraveling of this company is, of course, a cautionary tale about the many things that can go wrong at a start-up, like questionable bosses and plain old bad ideas.\\xa0Is it indicative of a larger problem in Silicon Valley? Industry veterans would probably say no. Some people view working for a dud of a start-up as a rite of passage — like a bad relationship that teaches you a lesson about what to avoid in a partner. Others figure that even if things go bad, there are so many good jobs in the area, you won’t be down on your luck for long.\\xa0But just in case, do a little extra homework before you move across the country to take a start-up job.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEU hits Apple with $14.5 billion Irish tax demand:\\xa0The European Commission ordered Apple Inc to pay Ireland unpaid taxes of up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) on Tuesday as it ruled the firm had received illegal state aid.\\xa0Apple and Dublin said the U.S. company\\'s tax treatment was in line with Irish and European Union law and they would appeal the ruling, which is part of a drive against what the EU says are sweetheart tax deals that usually smaller states in the bloc offer multinational companies to lure jobs and investment. Analysts said the size of the claim underlined the Commission\\'s aggressive stance, but since each case involves different circumstances and tax rules, lawyers said it was hard to see if further big claims were any more or less likely.\\xa0Apple, which had more than $200 billion in cash and readily marketable securities at the end of June, is likely to see the case drag out for years in EU and possibly Irish courts.\\xa0Apple warned investors in a July regulatory filing that the Commission\\'s investigation could lead to \"material\" liability for further tax payments, but that it could not estimate the impact. On Tuesday the company said it expects to place \"some amount of cash\" in an escrow account.\\xa0Tax experts say the European Commission faces a tough battle to convince courts to back up its stand. While the EU has found that certain tax regulations are anti-competitive, it has never before ruled whether countries have applied tax regulations fairly in the way it has with Apple, Starbucks and others.\\xa0As a result, some lawyers and accountants said they doubted Apple would end up paying back any tax.\\n\\n\\nTwitter is finally paying its best users to create videos:\\xa0Twitter wants the kind of video creators YouTube has — and the massive audiences that come with them.\\xa0To make this dream a reality, the company is pulling a page from YouTube’s playbook: It’s going to sell ads alongside creator videos and share that ad revenue with the people making the content. And Twitter is offering very appealing terms.\\xa0Unlike YouTube, which gives 55 percent of the money to creators and keeps 45 percent, Twitter is using the same revenue split it already offers other Amplify video partners, like the NFL: 70 percent to the content creator and 30 percent back to Twitter, according to a person familiar with the arrangement.\\xa0Of course, Twitter needs to offer an appealing revenue split like this. It’s nowhere close to the video destination YouTube and even Facebook have become, and it’s late to the game when it comes to paying creators. The network’s high-profile stars have wanted a revenue split for some time — it’s been a point of contention for the company’s stable of “Vine stars,” many of whom have left for places like YouTube where their videos actually make money.\\n\\n\\nA few dozen Nest Labs employees just headed to Google; here’s why:\\xa0Nest Labs, the maker of smart thermostats and smoke detectors, is parting ways with a few dozen employees who work on its Internet of Things platform. According to a Fortunereport that we’ve independently confirmed, those employees are joining Google per a restructuring. Both companies are subsidiaries of parent company Alphabet. The move would seem to make sense. Like Nest, Google has delved into the business of the connected home, including with its OnHub wireless router and Google Home, a portable speaker that’s powered by voice assistance technology and will take direct aim at Amazon’s popular Echo product once it ships later this year. Nest’s thermometers and cameras promise to communicate with Google Home. Nest employs roughly 1,000 people, including in engineering, product marketing and product management. Though its platform team was responsible for building out Nest’s APIs (so Nest products can communicate with other devices), as well as Nest’s Weave protocol (which allows Nest devices to communicate with each other), Nest will continue to build and develop software around its app, site and other services.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlphabet’s Legal Chief Steps Down From Uber Board:\\xa0David Drummond, the chief legal officer at Alphabet Inc., has stepped down from Uber Technologies Inc.’s board of directors as the two companies move further into each other’s territories.\\xa0Drummond joined the board in 2013 when GV, the venture capital arm of Alphabet formerly known as Google Ventures, led a $258 million round of financing for Uber. It remains GV’s largest investment, and the two companies worked together on projects, including the ability to call a car through Google Maps. However, relations between Alphabet’s Google unit and Uber have become strained in recent years. Bloomberg reported last year that Google had been working on a ride-hailing service using self-driving cars. Uber acquired Otto, an autonomous driving startup staffed by former Google employees, and is working with Volvo on driverless vehicles of its own, which the companies expect to begin rolling out in Pittsburgh this month. Uber has been developing its own mapping operation and is shooting street photography to create an alternative to Google’s map data.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nEU to hand Apple Irish tax bill of $1.1 billion, source says:\\xa0The European Commission will rule against Ireland\\'s tax dealings with Apple (AAPL.O) on Tuesday, two source familiar with the decision told Reuters, one of whom said Dublin would be told to recoup over 1 billion euros in back taxes.\\xa0The European Commission accused Ireland in 2014 of dodging international tax rules by letting Apple shelter profits worth tens of billions of dollars from tax collectors in return for maintaining jobs. Apple and Ireland rejected the accusation; both have said they will appeal any adverse ruling.\\xa0The source said the Commission will recommend a figure in back taxes that it expects to be collected, but it will be up to Irish authorities to calculate exactly what is owed.\\xa0A bill in excess of 1 billion euros ($1.12 billion) would be far more than the 30 million euros each the European Commission previously ordered Dutch authorities to recover from U.S. coffee chain Starbucks (SBUX.O) and Luxembourg from Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) for their tax deals. Apple employs 5,500 workers, or about a quarter of its European-based staff in the Irish city of Cork, where it is the largest private sector employer. It has said it paid Ireland\\'s 12.5 percent rate on all the income that it generates in the country.\\xa0Ireland\\'s low corporate tax rate has been a cornerstone of economic policy for 20 years, drawing investors from major multinational companies whose staff account for almost one in 10 workers in Ireland. Some opposition Irish lawmakers have urged Dublin to collect whatever tax the Commission orders it to. But the main opposition party Fianna Fail, whose support the minority administration relies on to pass laws, said it would support an appeal based on the reassurances it had been given by the government to date.\\n\\n\\nYou earn a million dollars a year and can’t get funded?\\xa0If you’re in the position of struggling to raise funds, here are some reasons why your pitch may not be resonating.\\xa0You paid $1.2 million to make $1 million:\\xa0The most common case of seemingly successful businesses struggling to raise funding is when they are paying $1.2 million to generate $1 million. Or, it’s not clear how you’ll turn $1 million into $10 million:\\xa0We seriously don’t expect every company to be a billion-dollar business. Our model works with $50 million and $100 million exits, but if you’re going to raise venture capital, youshould also be able to explain how you’ll achieve step-function growth — convincingly. A hockey-stick growth path to a billion dollar valuation isn’t required; it can be as simple as taking revenue from $1 million to $10 million.\\xa0So… If you’ve built a million-dollar business and are struggling to convince VCs, we’d love to talk to you! Just know that when you’re pitching investors, not all revenue is valued equally, and it’s just one factor among many that investors will use to evaluate your business.\\xa0Bryce Roberts put it well when he tweeted “Not all good businesses are good investments. Not all good investments are good businesses.” Your favorite neighborhood restaurant might generate a million dollars a year in revenue, but it would be a bad bet for VCs. Facebook lost money for years before going on to dominate global communication. If youdecide you want to play the VC game, just be sure to learn how the score is tallied.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChina’s Murky World Where E-Commerce Meets Student Lending:\\xa0Across college campuses in China, a small army of marketers is recruiting students to borrow money at interest rates many times that charged by the nation’s banks.\\xa0Those without a credit history or parental approval can borrow money to buy a smartphone, pay for holidays, or get the latest sneakers through a raft of apps such as Fenqile. The market leader, whose name literally means Happy Installment Payments, has 50,000 part-time marketers across more than 3,000 universities and proudly touts the slogan “Wait no more; love what I love.”\\xa0Welcome to the regulatory gray area where peer-to-peer lending meets e-commerce in China.\\xa0In the last three years, tens of millions of students have taken out micro-loans with the tap of a button to buy things. Once just the realm of startups, the sector has attracted heavy hitters in China’s online industry, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s finance affiliate and JD.com Inc., which are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the lending model. In a nation with 37 million college students, the market is expected to reach $15 billion, according to the Beijing-based market research firm Analysys. The apps sell everything from cameras to concert tickets sourced from third-parties, charging students annualized interest rates typically above 10 percent. The loans are then packaged and sold to wealthy individuals, who find the expected return of as much as 10 percent much more attractive than the central bank’s benchmark savings rate of 1.75 percent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow long before Amazon forces its Indian rivals into a merger or sale?\\xa0Three years into Amazon’s aggressive push in India, the country’s two home-grown e-commerce competitors are feeling the pressure. Both Flipkart and Snapdeal have raised more than a billion dollars, but have historically recorded big losses as they’ve engaged in discounting battles with each other and with Amazon. Amazon has made it clear it is willing to spend big to become the No. 1 e-commerce player in the country after failing to make a dent in another huge international market, China.\\xa0Now, it seems like every week there’s a new rumor of the two homegrown players considering a merger or sale. Alibaba, which owns a stake in Snapdeal and another Indian player, Paytm, is often in the conversation.\\xa0In any potential talks, however, Flipkart and Snapdeal’s frothy valuations could be a problem. Flipkart was valued last year at $15 billion while Snapdeal most recently secured a $6.5 billion valuation.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",
      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\nFour years and $22 billion later, WhatsApp has decided ads aren’t awful, after all:\\xa0First rule about being bought by an advertising company: You’re probably going to end up selling advertising. \\xa0WhatsApp to share user data with Facebook for ad targeting. Facebook-owned messaging giant WhatsApp has announced a big change to its privacy policy which, once a user accepts its new T&Cs, will see it start to share some user data with its parent company — including for ad-targeting purposes on the latter service.\\xa0“[B]y coordinating more with Facebook, we’ll be able to do things like track basic metrics about how often people use our services and better fight spam on WhatsApp,” WhatsApp writes in a blog on the change today.\\xa0“Facebook can offer better friend suggestions and show you more relevant ads if you have an account with them. For example, you might see an ad from a company you already work with, rather than one from someone you’ve never heard of.”\\xa0WhatsApp will also be sharing the data with the “Facebook family of companies” — so presumably its user data could also be fed to VR firm Oculus Rift, another Fb acquisition, and photo-sharing network Instagram.\\xa0WhatsApp data that will be shared under the new T&Cs includes the phone number a user used to verify their account, and the last time they used the service.\\xa0Two pieces of data which — on a creepiness scale of ‘personal intel you’d rather not hand over to a data-mining tech giant’ — are both right up there.\\n\\n\\nGoogle Fiber is pulling back on its broadband rollout as pressure grows to cut costs:\\xa0For the past year, Ruth Porat, the CFO of Google and its parent Alphabet, has told Wall Street that Google Fiber is her most expensive unit outside of the core business — and is well worth the costs.\\xa0Her bosses may be telling Fiber employees the opposite.\\xa0According to a report in The Information, Alphabet chiefs Larry Page and Sergey Brin recently instructed Fiber to severely trim staff and expenses, frustrated with mounting costs of delivering high-speed internet by digging up dirt.\\xa0Creating broadband networks via traditional pipes is enormously expensive. And Fiber still hasn’t proven that it has figured out a better way to do it. The Information story comes on the heels of reports that Fiber has put plans to build broadband networks on hold in two cities as it ponders ways to roll out experimental wireless tech.\\xa0Fiber, like the “Other Bets” businesses outside of Google, is facing ongoing scrutiny about its operations. Here are the key parts of The Information’s report.\\xa0The unit initially shot for five million broadband subscribers in its first years, but has fallen short of that.\\xa0Last month, Page told Craig Barratt, the CEO of Fiber (or Access, as it’s known), to halve his staff down to 500.\\xa0Porat, who has developed a reputation as a cost cutter, interceded on Fiber’s behalf, arguing to Page that Fiber’s business model is defensible. Barratt considered leaving earlier in the year, reportedly irked by the changes at Alphabet. If he did, he would not be the first “Other Bets” exec to do so.\\n\\n\\n\\nUber Loses at Least $1.2 Billion in First Half of 2016:\\xa0The ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies Inc. is not a public company, but every three months, dozens of shareholders get on a conference call to hear the latest details on its business performance from its head of finance, Gautam Gupta.\\xa0On Friday, Gupta told investors that Uber\\'s losses mounted in the second quarter. Even in the U.S., where Uber had turned a profit during its first quarter, the company was once again losing money.\\xa0In the first quarter of this year, Uber lost about $520 million before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to people familiar with the matter. In the second quarter the losses significantly exceeded $750\\xa0million, including a roughly $100 million shortfall in the U.S., those people said. That means Uber\\'s losses in the first half of 2016 totaled at least $1.27 billion.\\xa0Subsidies for Uber\\'s drivers are responsible for the majority of the company\\'s losses globally, Gupta told investors, according to people familiar with the matter. \"You won\\'t find too many technology companies that could lose this much money, this quickly,\" said Aswath Damodaran, a business professor at New York University who has written skeptically of Uber\\'s astronomical valuation on his blog. \"For a private business to raise as much capital as Uber has been able to is unprecedented.\"\\xa0Bookings grew tremendously from the first quarter of this year to the second, from above $3.8 billion to more than $5 billion. Net revenue, under generally accepted accounting principles, grew about 18 percent, from about $960 million in the first quarter to about $1.1 billion in the second.\\xa0Uber also told investors during the call that it was changing how it calculates UberPool\\'s contribution to revenue in the second quarter, which had the effect of increasing revenue.\\xa0Uber\\'s losses and revenue have generally grown in lockstep as the company\\'s global ambitions have expanded. Uber has lost money quarter after quarter. In 2015, Uber lost at least $2 billion before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Uber, which is seven years old, has lost at least $4 billion in the history of the company.\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst driverless taxi hits the streets of Singapore:\\xa0The first driverless taxi began work on Thursday in a limited public trial on the streets of Singapore.\\xa0Developer nuTonomy invited a select group of people to download their app and ride for free in its \"robo-taxi\" in a western Singapore hi-tech business district, hoping to get feedback ahead of a planned full launch of the service in 2018.The trial rides took place in a Mitsubishi i-MiEv electric vehicle, with an engineer sitting behind the steering wheel to monitor the system and take control if necessary.\\xa0The trial is on an on-going basis, nuTonomy said, and follows private testing that began in April.\\xa0Parker, whose company has partnered with the Singapore government on the project, said he hoped to have 100 taxis working commercially in the Southeast Asian citystate by 2018.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMost Americans streamed the Olympics from PCs, not mobile devices.\\xa0Mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, accounted for almost 20 percent of the evening\\'s Olympics stream. An additional 17 percent went to set-top boxes, such as Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV. Of these, Roku boxes were the overwhelming favorite among Olympics viewers, eating up a 10 percent share. In the end, however, PCs took the prize, accounting for more than 60 percent of consumption. \\xa0Why is this so interesting? Well, much of the narrative surrounding entertainment and technology these days has to do with mobile devices becoming a more dominant platform. Sandvine\\'s data show that iPhones, Android devices and iPads account for almost one-third of general Internet consumption, much higher than what we see from the chart above.\\xa0Analysts say this discrepancy highlights the particular way in which Americans could access their Olympics coverage online. To watch the Internet live stream, viewers needed to log in through their cable subscription. The downside to this meant being chained to a cable provider, but the upside was that once you authenticated you could watch from any device — mobile or otherwise. Although much of our media consumption is increasingly shifting toward mobile devices, live-stream events such as the Olympics may be one area where PCs could remain dominant for some time.\\n\\n\\nHP Inc. Forecasts Earnings That Fall Short of Estimates:\\xa0HP Inc., which sells personal computers and printers, forecast fiscal fourth-quarter profit that may fall short of analysts’ estimates, hurt by slumping demand for its products. The shares fell as much as 5.8 percent in extended trading after the announcement. Sales fell 3.8 percent to $11.9 billion, compared with estimates of $11.5 billion. Sales of personal systems, which includes the computer lines, of $7.5 billion was unchanged from a year earlier. That compares with a decline of 10 percent in the second quarter. Commercial sales fell 3 percent while the consumer business climbed 8 percent in the personal systems unit. Printing revenue declined 14 percent to $4.4 billion, compared with a decline of 16 percent in the previous quarter. Consumer printing sales fared worse than the commercial business.\\n\\n\\nFord leads $24M investment in India-based vehicle rental company Zoomcar:\\xa0Hot on the heels of a deal with a self-driving sensor technology startup, the automotive giant has backed Zoomcar, a Zipcar-like company that operates in India. Subsidiary Ford Smart Mobility led a $24 million Series B round, with participation from returning investors Sequoia Capital, Nokia Growth Partners (NGP) and Empire Angels. The company’s valuation was not disclosed.\\xa0Four-year-old Zoomcar closed an $11 million Series B round last summer following an $8 million raise in late 2014. This new round — which had been reported in Indian press as early as July — takes it to over $46 million in VC money to date.\\xa0Zoomcar is a car rental service based on successful Western models like Zipcar, which wasbought by Avis for $500 million three years ago. The startup is based in Bangalore and it currently claims to offer 2,000 cars around seven of India’s tier-one cities, with 75 percent occupancy and 1.5 million app downloads. Ford was Zoomcar’s first OEM partner, and the startup said Ford provides “most” of the vehicles on its platform.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTesla’s new 100 kWH battery makes it the third-fastest accelerating car ever:\\xa0Tesla’s Model S and Model X vehicles just got faster. On a call with journalists today, Elon Musk unveiled a larger battery pack — 100 kWH — that enables the Model S to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 2.5 seconds in what the company calls “ludicrous” mode.\\xa0That makes the Model S the third-fastest production car ever made, after the Ferrari LaFerrari and the Porsche 918 Spyder, but it’s the quickest pure electric vehicle that has the capacity to seat up to five adults and two children, according to the company.\\xa0In an industry first, the battery also enables the car to drive an estimated 315 miles on a single charge. This is the first electric vehicle to go above a range of 300 miles, according to Tesla. The Model S P100D will start at $135,000 — compared to a $125,000 MSRP for the Model S P90D equipped with ludicrous mode — and the Model X P100D will start at $135,500. The Model X P90D started at $115,500.\\n\\n\\nNarrative Science can now describe your Tableau charts for you:\\xa0Tableau Software‘s shares soared 13 percent on Tuesday following the announcement that the data analytics provider has partnered with Narrative Science, a Chicago-based company that develops natural language generation (NLG) tools. The result of the partnership is Narratives for Tableau, a free Chrome extension that automatically creates written explanations for Tableau graphics. Let’s say, for example, that you have a chart — made with Tableau — of sales and profits of your business for a certain amount of time. The extension, which works with Tableau Server 10.0 or the free Tableau Public service, will generate a narrative description of the data by writing sentences such as “Sales and profit ratio moved in opposite directions from January 2011 to December 2014,” as shown in this example. Narrative Science is best known for Quill, a platform that can take data — say, sports scores — and turn them into stories. Narratives for Tableau is one example of applying Quill’s capabilities, Frankel pointed out. Once Narratives for Tableau has generated the text, users can customize it by choosing a paragraph- or bullet point-style for the description, among other things. If users are not satisfied with the results, they can also make changes to the text.\\n\\n\\nPinterest Acquires Instapaper to Get Smarter About Articles:\\xa0Pinterest Inc. is buying Instapaper, the app that lets you save an article to read later, as it works to understand the technology behind recommending stories for people.\\xa0The acquisition of Instapaper, which has expertise in saving, curating and analyzing articles, aligns with Pinterest\\'s goal to provide content that fits users\\' interests, the company said in a statement. Pinterest declined to comment on a price for the deal. Instapaper, started in 2008 by Tumblr co-founder Marco Arment, is known for helping people save longer-form stories they don\\'t have time to read. Pinterest said people use its application to save articles, though they often tend to be image-based how-to stories about recipes or from inspirational do-it-yourself blogs. Instapaper\\'s technology could help improve Pinterest\\'s ability to match content with its users\\' interests.\\n\\n\\nOne Kings Lane sold for less than $30 million after being valued at $900 million:\\xa0One Kings Lane, an online home-furnishings retailer, fetched less than $30 million in its recent sale to Bed Bath & Beyond, according to three people familiar with the deal. The purchase price marks a massive discount from a valuation of $900 million that the startup had secured when it raised more than $100 million from investors in early 2014. In the wake of Dollar Shave Club’s $1 billion sale to Unilever and Walmart’s impending $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet, the One Kings Lane outcome is a reminder of how brutal the e-commerce industry can be for many startups.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFormer Flipkart CEO’s Employee Clash Shows Indian Startup Trauma..:\\xa0India’s largest online shopping service is heating up, and not in a good way. Flipkart’s regular Friday townhall grew tense after employees incensed by hundreds of job cuts openly accused management of betrayal. Taken aback, chairman Sachin Bansal countered that the departures stemmed from poor performance and he lost his job as chief executive for the same reason.\\xa0The co-founder admitted the company had missed financial targets in recent months, prompting an overhaul of its top rungs, according to employees who attended the meeting. He didn’t elaborate but recent moves -- including a brief decision to go mobile app-only after ditching its fashion site -- may have granted an opening to a hard-charging Amazon.com Inc.\\xa0Bansal’s unusual candor, which drew applause, underscores the plight of the country’s technology sector as competition intensifies and funding begins to dry up.\\n\\n\\n..Even as analysts opine that Amazon overtook Flipkart in India July e-commerce sales:\\xa0Barely three years after launching in India, Amazon (Amazon Seller Services Pvt. Ltd) likely exceeded Flipkart in terms of gross sales in July.\\xa0Flipkart reported gross sales or gross merchandise value (GMV) of less than Rs.2,000 crore in July, while Amazon’s gross sales crept up above Rs.2,000 crore, according to five people familiar with the companies’ numbers. Another local online marketplace Snapdeal (Jasper Infotech Pvt. Ltd) reported gross sales numbers of roughly Rs.600 crore, a fall of more than 50% from the sales it had been generating until the end of last year, said two other people, familiar with the company’s numbers.\\xa0Gross sales refer to the value of goods sold on a site, and not net revenue. (Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon are structured as marketplaces because of regulations; their net revenue comprises the commissions they charge their third-party sellers on every transaction and fees for services)\\xa0To be sure, the numbers are only for the month of July and the market share battle between Flipkart and Amazon is far from over.\\xa0Flipkart’s numbers also exclude revenue at Myntra and Jabong, the two large fashion retailers it owns. Snapdeal’s numbers exclude sales at FreeCharge, its payments arm. Including Myntra and Jabong revenues, Flipkart is still comfortably ahead of Amazon.\\xa0Yet, the numbers confirm reports in Mint and other publications since the start of the year that Flipkart and Amazon are running neck-and-neck in the e-commerce market share battle and the latter is close to overtaking it. This is the first time the exact picture has emerged.\\n\\n\\nChinese investors buy ad tech startup Media.net for $900 million:\\xa0Advertising technology startup Media.net, founded by tech entrepreneur Divyank Turakhia, said on Monday it had been acquired for about $900 million by a group of Chinese investors.\\xa0The deal would represent the third-largest in the ad tech industry, after Google\\'s acquisition of DoubleClick and Microsoft Corp\\'s for aQuantive. More here:\\xa0Ad-tech firm Media.net Sells to China Group for $900 Million:\\xa0The startup, which powers contextual ads offered by Yahoo! and Microsoft’s Bing, plans a move akin to a reverse merger that would make it a public company in China.Media.net, which is based in Dubai and New York, is touting this as the third-largest ad-tech acquisition in history. However, the complex deal more closely resembles a reverse merger, where a private company takes over a public one and bypasses the formalities of an initial public offering.\\xa0Technology entrepreneur Divyank Turakhia started Media.net in 2010 and bootstrapped the business. The company provides the technology powering contextual ads offered by Yahoo! Inc. and Microsoft Corp.’s Bing search engine. The system is similar to one offered by Google, choosing which ads to show based on the content of the web page they appear on.\\xa0The deal comes as merger activity involving ad-tech companies is declining. There were 43 deals during the first half of the year, according to research firm PitchBook Data. That’s a 45 percent decline from the same period last year.\\xa0Media.net generated $232 million in revenue last year, more than half of which came from mobile visitors, Turakhia said. The U.S. accounts for 90 percent of Media.net’s revenue, but the company is hoping to make a big push into China after the deal, he said.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAmazon wants to sell a cheaper music subscription service that will only work on its Echo player:\\xa0Spotify, Apple Music and everyone else cost $10 a month. Amazon wants to charge half of that. Amazon wants to launch a music subscription service that would work the same way services from Apple, Spotify and many others work: $10 a month, for all the music you can stream, anywhere you want to stream it. \\xa0But Amazon is also working on a second service that would differ in two significant ways from industry rivals: It would cost half the price, and it would only work on Amazon’s Echo hardware. Industry sources say Amazon would like to launch both services in September, but has yet to finalize deals with major music labels and publishers. One sticking point, sources say, is whether Amazon will sell the cheaper service for $4 or $5 a month.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLyft Is Said to Seek a Buyer, Without Success: It is not an easy thing to be an independent ride-hailing company these days.\\xa0For one, it takes billions of dollars and hundreds of employees to spread to new cities, to market the service and to recruit drivers. Legislators and local laws are often not in your favor. And competitors with deep pockets from all over the world are waiting to cheer if you happen to fail.\\xa0Lyft, the second-biggest ride-hailing company in the United States behind Uber, is grappling with those forces — but has found that its options are limited.\\xa0The company, which is based in San Francisco, has in recent months held talks or made approaches to sell itself to companies including General Motors, Apple, Google, Amazon, Uber and Didi Chuxing, according to a dozen people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. Lyft’s discussions were most serious with G.M., which is one of the ride-hailing company’s largest investors. Still, G.M. never made a written offer to buy Lyft, said the people, and in the end, Lyft did not find a buyer.\\xa0Lyft is not in danger of closing down and has a cash cushion of $1.4 billion, some of these people added, so the company will continue as an independent entity.\\xa0Still, the talks underline how difficult it has become to operate in the ride-hailing market, where people can book rides from drivers through a smartphone app. While ride-hailing companies do not own fleets of cars and instead rely on drivers who have their own vehicles, the business is highly capital-intensive. Venture capitalists and other investors have poured billions of dollars into the companies.\\n\\n\\nUber Tells Investors It Wouldn’t Pay Above $2 Billion for Lyft:\\xa0As Lyft Inc. was gauging interest from prospective acquirers, executives from Uber Technologies Inc. told investors in the past few weeks that the company wouldn\\'t pay more than $2 billion to purchase its main U.S. ride-hailing competitor, said people familiar with the matter.\\xa0Uber didn\\'t make a formal offer, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. Uber had previously considered purchasing Lyft as far back as 2014, and the two San Francisco companies have discussed the prospect informally, one of the people said. Despite executives floating the $2 billion price tag, Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick has said privately that he would not support such a deal because he believes it would face intense regulatory scrutiny, the person said.\\xa0Regardless, Lyft wouldn\\'t consider $2 billion to be a credible offer, said another person familiar with the matter. Recode reported on Friday that Lyft sought as much as $9 billion but failed to secure serious interest. As fierce rivals, Uber has every incentive to downplay Lyft\\'s value to investors and has done so in the past. Lyft and Uber declined to comment.\\n\\n\\nHampton Creek, Maker of Just Mayo, Is Said to Be Under Inquiry:\\xa0Hampton Creek, a prominent start-up that is trying to bring tech industry panache to the world of mayonnaise, ranch dressing and other food products, has come under scrutiny by regulators for its business practices.\\xa0The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened a preliminary inquiry into Hampton Creek, according to a person briefed on the situation who asked not to be named because it had not been announced publicly.\\xa0The S.E.C. inquiry is a response to a recent report from Bloomberg News that described an organized effort by Hampton Creek to buy large quantities of its Just Mayo product — a mayonnaise that uses a plant-based ingredient instead of eggs — by sending undercover contractors into stores.Bloomberg’s report said the product buyback effort, which took place in 2014, made Just Mayo seem more popular than it was, not long before Hampton Creek raised $90 million from venture capitalists and other private investors. The basic details of the program were confirmed by a former Hampton Creek employee, who asked for anonymity because of confidentiality restrictions with his onetime employer. The inquiry may be only the start of tougher questions facing Hampton Creek. The company is believed to be losing significant amounts of money. It is raising up to $220 million from investors, according to a Delaware filing provided by Equidate, which tracks private company shares.\\xa0It’s not uncommon, of course, for start-ups to bleed red ink in their early days. But Hampton Creek, founded in 2011, faces some basic challenges with the manufacturing costs for its products.\\xa0According to one former employee, in 2014 the company had negative gross margins of about 20 percent on Just Mayo, meaning that the raw cost to the company for every $1 it got in sales was about $1.20. The issue arises from Hampton Creek’s use of premium ingredients in its products without charging shoppers the often eye-popping prices attached to such food products. The vegetable oil used in Just Mayo, for example, does not come from genetically modified organism sources, which adds significant cost, according to the former employee.\\xa0But on Walmart.com on Friday, a 30-ounce jar of Just Mayo was selling for $3.66 — 32 cents less than a jar of Hellmann’s mayonnaise of the same size.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber Aims for an Edge in the Race for a Self-Driving Future:\\xa0On Thursday, Uber said that it would begin testing self-driving cars in Pittsburgh in a matter of weeks, allowing people in the city to hail modified versions of Volvo sport utility vehicles to get around the city.\\xa0Uber also said it had acquired Otto, a 90-person start-up including former Google and Carnegie Mellon engineers that is focused on developing self-driving truck technology to upend the shipping industry. Those moves are the most recent indications of Uber’s ambitions for autonomous vehicles that can provide services to both consumers and businesses.\\xa0And they come after Ford Motor’s announcement this week that it would put fleets of self-driving taxis onto American roads in five years. As part of that effort, Ford said it had acquired an Israeli start-up, Saips, that specializes in computer vision, a crucial technology for self-driving cars. Ford also announced investments in three other companies involved in major technologies for driverless vehicles.\\xa0Suddenly, it seems, both Silicon Valley and Detroit are doubling down on their bets for autonomous vehicles. And in what could emerge as a self-driving-car arms race, the players are investing in, or partnering with, or buying outright the specialty companies most focused on the requisite hardware, software and artificial intelligence capabilities.\\n\\n\\nWhen Google quietly began working on cars that drive themselves, über was just a German word.\\xa0Now, nine years later, Uber the ride-hailing company looks set to get regular people inside autonomous vehicles first — a move that’s critical for Uber, and dispiriting for the audacious project hatched inside of Google.\\xa0Uber said on Thursday that, along with Volvo, it will test a fleet of on-demand autonomous cars in Pittsburgh later this month. An Uber driver will still be in the car. But, more importantly, so will a customer.\\xa0That’s something that Google has yet to do.\\xa0When the search giant first unfurled its self-driving plans, it was the only company tackling the advanced tech. Not anymore: All the major car companies have joined the fray — and shown a willingness to cut big checks for the tech behind it.\\xa0Google is well ahead on the technical challenges of driverless vehicles, according to most in the industry. But those same people, in recent months, have begun asking why, nearly a decade after hiring top roboticists to build its project, Google has not delivered something to market.\\xa0There are a number of reasons why Google has been a laggard to new rivals in the field.\\xa0One is its devotion to going fully driverless, a far more difficult feat. That’s partially because, unlike the car companies and Uber, the Google self-driving cars don’t need an immediate revenue stream. They have search ads to bankroll them. Yet other forces may be holding back Google’s cars — like internal dynamics at the project, now within the X subsidiary under Google parent Alphabet. Alphabet has kept its revenue strategy for the unit under wraps. Some sources say that is because they have not settled on one yet.\\xa0“They went back and forth all the time,” said one person who recently left X. Still, frustration with the inertia of Google’s self-driving car looks to be hitting its own ranks.\\xa0Chris Urmson, the CTO and former director of the car unit, recently departed, along with two early engineers.\\xa0Earlier this year, several members of the project, including co-founder Anthony Levandowski, decamped to form Otto, an autonomous trucking startup. With its announcement this morning, Uber also said it had acquired Otto.\\n\\n\\n\\nApplied Materials forecast beats on chip, display demand:\\xa0Applied Materials Inc forecast current-quarter revenue and profit far above analysts\\' estimates as the company benefits from demand for newer technology to make displays and smartphone memory chips.\\xa0Shares of the world\\'s largest supplier of tools used to make semiconductors rose 5.7 percent to $29.25 in after-hours trading on Thursday. If the current gains hold, the stock is set to open at a 15-year high on Friday.\\xa0The rising popularity of mobile devices has fueled demand and investments in 3D NAND memory chips, which can store data without using up power. Applied Materials is considered an bellwether and its results are seen as an indicator for the overall chip industry.\\xa0The company has also gained from growing demand for displays using organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology, where its products help manufacture displays used in televisions, phones and computer screens.\\xa0Orders in the business surged 153 percent to $803 million in the latest quarter. Applied Materials\\' net sales rose 13.3 percent to $2.82 billion in the third quarter.\\xa0The company\\'s net income rose to $505 million, or 46 cents per share, from $329 million, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier.Up to Thursday\\'s close, the company\\'s stock had gained about 48 percent this year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPinterest Follows Rivals Into Selling Video Ads:\\xa0Pinterest is finally taking the plunge that many other tech companies already have: It has started selling video advertising.\\xa0Video ads from brands like Kate Spade and bareMinerals will start appearing in the virtual scrapbook-like Pinterest feed on Wednesday and into the coming weeks, and Pinterest is hopeful that ads from other brands will soon follow.\\xa0The new ads will show up in a silent, GIF-like format within Pinterest’s feed, and will play with sound once clicked. Users will be able to click images, or pins, of featured products next to the videos. That could, for instance, bring them to a brand’s website or allow them to buy the product without leaving Pinterest.\\xa0The move puts the social-bookmarking site in competition with the likes of Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat, as well as large digital publishers, which are all vying for the increasingly large amounts of marketers’ digital ad dollars.\\xa0Pinterest allows people to save links to images and videos, known as pins, to aesthetically pleasing virtual bulletin boards, and to follow the boards created by others. It has become a popular destination for consumers looking to buy goods, particularly in areas like home improvement and cooking, and for the brands looking to reach them. Pinterest says 75 percent of the content people consume on its site comes from businesses.\\xa0Pinterest, which says it has more than 100 million visitors a month, has largely been absent from conversations about videos, even as such content has boomed in popularity on its site. The company said it had seen a 60 percent increase in the number of videos saved by users in the last year.\\xa0Last year, Etsy was the website with the greatest number of links from Pinterest’s Save button. Now, it is YouTube. “Candidly, the company just in general has underinvested until now in video as a platform,” Jon Kaplan, the head of global sales at Pinterest, said in an interview. “We wanted to make sure it was customized and specific to the way people use our platform. What you’re going to see going forward is a very big investment in video.”\\n\\n\\nAn Expert in Valuation Says Uber Is Only Worth $28 Billion, Not $62.5 Billion:\\xa0According to Aswath Damodaran, a professor who specializes in equity valuation at NYU\\'s Stern School of Business, Uber is running up against the roadblock that has thwarted many upstart businesses: Profit. While Damodaran thinks Uber and riding sharing will continue to expand, albeit at a slower pace, he\\'s concerned about whether revenues will follow. China especially worries him given Uber\\'s recent sale of its operations in that country to Didi Chuxing, its biggest rival there. The decision to exit \"even if it was the right one from the perspective of saving itself from a cash war, will reduce its potential revenues in the future.\" \\xa0In the other places where Uber does continue to operate, there are often large discounts for riders and other special promotions. This is proof that the business model is challenged, according to Damodaran. \"I believe that a significant portion of their expenses are associating with maintaining revenues rather than growing them,\" he says. \"In effect, it looks like the business model that has brought these companies as far as they have in such a short time period are flawed, because what allowed these companies to grow incredibly fast is getting in the way of converting revenues to profits, since there are no moats to defend.\" Damodaran says that young companies all face a point in time that he calls the \"Bar Mitzvah Moment,\" when the focus shifts from growth to evidence that the business model can be profitable. In his mind, that moment is right now for ride sharing. \"After an initial life, where investors have been easily sated with reports of more ride sharing usage (number of cities served, rides, drivers etc.), these investors are starting to ask the tough questions about how ride sharing companies propose turning these impressive usage statistics into profits.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nLenovo\\'s first-quarter profit jumps 64 percent, beating estimates:\\xa0China\\'s Lenovo Group Ltd, the world\\'s biggest personal computer (PC) maker, said on Thursday its first-quarter net profit rose 64 percent, beating estimates as solid PC sales offset tepid smartphone demand.\\xa0Beijing-based Lenovo said in a filing that net profit grew to $173 million for the quarter ended June from $105 million in the same period a year earlier. That was more than the $130.1 million average of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters SmartEstimates.\\xa0First-quarter revenue dropped 6 percent to $10.05 billion from a year earlier, compared with an average of $9.63 billion estimated by analysts. Lenovo consolidated its hold on the slowing PC market during the quarter. PC shipments fell 2 percent year-on-year, compared with a 4 percent decline in the broader industry.\\xa0Like peer Xiaomi Inc, Lenovo has been focusing on diversifying away from intense competition in low-margin devices in China - still the world\\'s largest handset market but affected by the slowing Chinese economy.According to researcher TrendForce, Lenovo had a 4.5 percent share of the global smartphone market in April-June, leaving it a distant seventh after top player Samsung Electronics Co Ltd\\'s 24 percent and Apple Inc\\'s 15 percent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

The employees that are being retrenched are located across a dozen cities and are being given three months’ salary as compensation, said the people mentioned above. These include current and former employees of the cab hailing company.Ola had acquired smaller rival TaxiForSure for $200 million in early 2015 to strengthen its position against Uber Technologies Inc.\\xa0After the acquisition, Ola had centralized TaxiForSure’s operations to three major cities–Mumbai, Bengaluru and Delhi–and eight smaller cities. The company kept around 250 employees each in the three metros and around 30 each in the eight other cities. The layoff and shutdown comes at a time when Ola is locked in a bruising battle with Uber that involved public spats and legal wrangling. It is also dealing with adverse regulatory environment in various states that affect its operations.\\xa0The company has been trying for a large fundraise for quite some time. Ola has so far raised around $1.2 billion from investors including Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. The taxi-hailing firm was valued around $5 billion at the time of its last fundraising.\\xa0Although Ola had initially planned to retain TaxiForSure as a separate brand, resource crunch seems to have forced the company to wind down the unit. The people cited above said that drivers on TaxiForSure have been moved to the Ola platform. The company has also been prompting TaxiForSure users to migrate to the Ola app in recent months.\\n\\n\\nCisco Systems to lay off about 14,000 employees: CRN:\\xa0Cisco is laying off about 14,000 employees, representing nearly 20 percent of the network equipment maker\\'s global workforce, technology news site CRN reported, citing sources close to the company.\\xa0San Jose, California-based Cisco is expected to announce the cuts within the next few weeks, the report said, as the company transition from its hardware roots into a software-centric organization.\\xa0Cisco, which had more than 70,000 employees as of April 30, declined to comment.\\xa0Cisco increasingly requires \"different skill sets\" for the \"software-defined future\" than it did in the past, as it pushes to capture a higher share of the addressable market and aims to boost its margins, the CRN report said citing a source familiar with the situation.\\xa0Cisco has been investing in new products such as data analytics software and cloud-based tools for data centers, to offset the impact of sluggish spending by telecom carriers and enterprises on its main business of making network switches and routers.\\xa0The company has already offered many early retirement package plans to Cisco\\'s employees, according to CRN.\\n\\n\\n\\nFord Promises Fleets of Driverless Cars Within Five Years:\\xa0At a news conference on Tuesday at the company’s research center in Palo Alto, Calif., Mark Fields, Ford’s chief executive, said the company planned to mass produce driverless cars and have them in commercial operation in a ride-hailing service by 2021.Beyond that, Mr. Fields’s announcement was short on specifics. But he said that the vehicles Ford envisioned would be radically different from those that populate American roads now.\\xa0“That means there’s going to be no steering wheel. There’s going to be no gas pedal. There’s going to be no brake pedal,’’ he said. “If someone had told you 10 years ago, or even five years ago, that the C.E.O. of a major automaker American car company is going to be announcing the mass production of fully autonomous vehicles, they would have been called crazy or nuts or both.”\\xa0The company also said on Tuesday that as part of the effort, it planned to expand its Palo Alto center, doubling the number of employees who work there over the next year, from the current 130.\\xa0Ford also said it had acquired an Israeli start-up, Saips, that specializes in computer vision, a crucial technology for self-driving cars.

When it is final, the judgment funds will be set aside while Gawker appeals its court case; eventually the money will go to the side that wins.\\xa0Whatever the result of the case, the auction is a disappointing conclusion for Denton, who founded the company in 2002.\\xa0Last year, as rival media companies like Vice, BuzzFeed and Vox Media (which owns this site) were raising money at increasingly high valuations, Denton was arguing that his company was worth $250 million or more.\\n\\n\\n\\n‘Shadow Brokers’ Leak Raises Alarming Question: Was the N.S.A. Hacked?\\xa0The release on websites this week of what appears to be top-secret computer code that the National Security Agency has used to break into the networks of foreign governments and other espionage targets has caused deep concern inside American intelligence agencies, raising the question of whether America’s own elite operatives have been hacked and their methods revealed.\\xa0Most outside experts who examined the posts, by a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers, said they contained what appeared to be genuine samples of the code — though somewhat outdated — used in the production of the N.S.A.’s custom-built malware.Most of the code was designed to break through network firewalls and get inside the computer systems of competitors like Russia, China and Iran. That, in turn, allows the N.S.A. to place “implants” in the system, which can lurk unseen for years and be used to monitor network traffic or enable a debilitating computer attack.\\xa0According to these experts, the coding resembled a series of “products” developed inside the N.S.A.’s highly classified Tailored Access Operations unit, some of which were described in general terms in documents stolen three years ago by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor now living in Russia.\\xa0But the code does not appear to have come from Mr. Snowden’s archive, which was mostly composed of PowerPoint files and other documents that described N.S.A. programs. The documents released by Mr. Snowden and his associates contained no actual source code used to break into the networks of foreign powers.\\xa0Whoever obtained the source code apparently broke into either the top-secret, highly compartmentalized computer servers of the N.S.A. or other servers around the world that the agency would have used to store the files. The code that was published on Monday dates to mid-2013, when, after Mr. Snowden’s disclosures, the agency shuttered many of its existing servers and moved code to new ones as a security measure. While still widely considered the most talented group of state-sponsored hackers in the world, the N.S.A. is still recovering from Mr. Snowden’s disclosures; it has spent hundreds of millions of dollars reconfiguring and locking down its systems.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXiaomi Phone Shipments Fall 38% in China as Huawei Takes Lead; Apple Falls Behind:\\xa0Xiaomi Corp., the once-hot Chinese smartphone maker, saw shipments tumble 38 percent in China in the second quarter as Huawei Technologies Co. took over the top spot in the world’s largest market.\\xa0Xiaomi shipped 10.5 million smartphones in the quarter, down from 17.1 million in the same period a year earlier, according to research from International Data Corp. That made the company the fourth-largest competitor in the market behind Huawei, OPPO and Vivo. Xiaomi was once valued at $46 billion, according to CB Insights.\\xa0The Chinese market has grown increasingly competitive as domestic manufacturers have improved their quality, design and marketing, putting pressure on global leaders Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Apple saw shipments in China drop 32 percent in the second quarter and the iPhone maker fell to fifth in the market, according to IDC.\\xa0The research firm said that Huawei and OPPO gained ground by concentrating on one or two key attributes in their marketing messages. Huawei emphasized the Leica lens now available on its phones, while OPPO pitched fast-charging technology.\\xa0Apple’s global shipments are set to decline in 2016 as it continues to lose ground in its largest overseas market, Canalys said in a separate report.\\xa0“The iPhones lack features such as waterproofing and wireless charging. Apple needs to catch up with the competition if it wants to compete,” Canalys research analyst Jessie Ding wrote.\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft’s HoloLens Technology Adopted by Israeli Military:\\xa0If Pokemon Go achieved one thing, it was showing the world that augmented realitytechnologies are ready for the mainstream. Israel’s military thinks AR is ready for another use: battlefield training.\\xa0The Israeli army’s C2 Systems Department recently purchased two HoloLens glasses from Microsoft Corp. The commander of the head programming department, Major Rotem Bashi, intends to develop the technology to improve battlefield strategy and train field personnel. And quickly: He intends for HoloLens to be used on active duty within months. At the army base outside Tel Aviv, a handful of developers in Bashi’s team created a software program in less than a month that allows commanders to manipulate military terrain models and intelligence data to monitor troop positioning from enemy vantage points. Battlefield maps are superimposed on top of the real terrain, streamed in via satellite, to create a blend that can be interacted with via sight, voice and hand gestures. The unit is now finding ways to allow HoloLens-wearing medics to operate on wounded with simultaneous instruction from trained surgeons, and combat soldiers to fix equipment malfunctions. It’s far removed from hurling Pokeballs at Pidgeys and Rattatas in Pokemon Go, but based on similar principles.\\xa0Besides adapting the HoloLens to military life, Bashi’s unit is working on a product that will give headquarters an online report about a combatant’s physiological state in the field.\\n\\n\\nLinkedIn sues anonymous data scrapers:\\xa0LinkedIn is trying to lock down its exclusive relationship with its users.\\xa0The professional networking company filed suit against 100 unnamed individuals last week for using bots to harvest user profiles from its website. The lawsuit is a preliminary step to revealing the identities of the scrapers — LinkedIn intends to ask the court to reveal the true identities behind the scrapers’ IP addresses — and a way to maintain its exclusive hold on users’ resumes.\\xa0But LinkedIn’s lawsuit also raises questions about how to police bot use. The company, which was recently snapped up by Microsoft for $26.2 billion, has invoked the controversial Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in its suit against the unidentified scrapers, claiming that collecting user profiles from the site amounts to hacking.\\xa0LinkedIn’s case accuses the anonymous scrapers of building a massive botnet and circumventing the restrictions LinkedIn uses to prevent profile collection by undesirable third parties.\\xa0The lawsuit details several of LinkedIn’s automated tools that prevent data harvesting. Dubbed FUSE, Quicksand and Sentinel, these tools monitor the web traffic of LinkedIn users and limit how many other profiles a user can view, and how quickly a user can view those profiles. This tracking is intended to prevent scrapers from signing up for fake LinkedIn profiles and then vacuuming up vast amounts of data. The company also uses a tool called Org Block to block IP addresses it suspects of scraping and uses Member and Guest Request Scoring to track page requests.\\xa0But paradoxically, LinkedIn doesn’t want to prohibit scraping altogether. Search engines like Google use bots to index websites and turn up relevant results — and LinkedIn wants to allow this type of scraping to occur.\\xa0“LinkedIn ‘whitelists’ a number of popular and reputable service providers, search engines, and other platforms so as to permit them to query and index the LinkedIn website, without being subject to all of LinkedIn’s security measures,” the company explains in its suit. The scrapers targeted in the lawsuit circumvented LinkedIn’s bot-blocking tools by sending their requests through one of these ‘whitelisted’ entities, a third-party cloud service provider.\\n\\n\\nPeter Thiel says journalism will be just fine, since he’ll decide what’s good journalism:\\xa0Peter Thiel is a billionaire who decided he didn’t like Gawker Media after it outed him as gay. So he funded Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit against the company, and they won. Now Gawker is selling itself in a bankruptcy auction.\\xa0Today, the same day that bids for Gawker are due, Thiel published an op-ed in the New York Timesas a sort of victory lap, but also to muster votes for a bill currently wending its way through Congress, the Intimate Privacy Protection Act.\\xa0It\\'s more commonly known as the revenge-porn bill, which would make it illegal to transmit private images and messages, but Thiel has co-opted it for his own purposes, referring to it by a lesser-known nickname, the Gawker Bill.\\xa0But the most interesting part of Thiel’s editorial is what he says about the need for a free press: It’s telling that despite the fact he felt Gawker had invaded his privacy, Thiel himself never filed a lawsuit — he’s fighting via proxies.\\xa0In trying to determine what should and shouldn’t qualify as journalism, Thiel is exercising the classic Silicon Valley pretension to attempt to own the definition, to write its own narrative, devoid of context or skepticism.\\xa0But smart publishers will react to Thiel’s call to arms in a similar vein to the closing words of his editorial: He can’t do it, if we don’t let him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba passes earnings milestones, silent on SEC probe:\\xa0China\\'s Alibaba Group Holding posted its best revenue growth since before the e-commerce titan\\'s listing in late 2014, lifting its shares to their highest level in a year. But Alibaba was silent on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation into its accounting practices, which have long been the subject of criticism. In the three months to June 30, Alibaba also made more money from mobile shopping than from PCs for the first time, helping to send its shares up by more than 5 percent to $92.10 in New York, its highest level in more than a year.\"This is a decoupling of revenue from GMV (gross merchandise volume),\" he said, referring to a measure of the total value of goods transacted on Alibaba\\'s online shopping platforms. Despite GMV growth remaining low compared to previous years, rising 24 percent to 837 billion yuan, Alibaba is squeezing more money out of its e-commerce business, chiefly from advertising. That translated to quarterly revenues of 32.15 billion yuan ($4.84 billion), a 59 percent leap from the previous year and the highest growth rate since late 2013. While China e-commerce was strong for Alibaba in its first quarter, the company is also investing in other businesses including cloud computing arm Aliyun, driverless vehicles and online shopping in Southeast Asia. It hopes these can become an eventual source of growth as Alibaba faces the prospect of a saturated online retail market in China. Although some are showing promise - Aliyun sales rose 156 percent, though only contributed 4 percent of total revenue - most are still loss-making.\\n\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft is buying a company that lets viewers control video game live streams:\\xa0Today, Microsoft announced its plans to acquire live streaming service Beam, a Seattle-based company that lets users influence and interact with a video game being streamed by another player. Beam launched in January to compete against well-established game streaming services from Twitch and YouTube. It set itself apart by taking a core concept made popular by streamers — the notion of letting players control a game from afar — and turning into a unique streaming platform.\\xa0For instance, Beam lets viewers suggest challenges for streamers and even alter in-game aspects like weapon loadout and quest selection. It also lets developers create special button layouts for viewers to interact with games being streamed through Beam. To maintain quality, the company\\'s technology drastically reduces the lag between a player\\'s actions and what the viewers see on the stream, whereas competitors like Twitch have a roughly 10 to 15 second delay. It\\'s unclear how Microsoft plans to incorporate Beam\\'s technology into its own online gaming platform. But the company points to Minecraft, now a Microsoft property, as the type of game well-suited to Beam\\'s technology. Microsoft did not disclose the financial terms of the deal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne year later, Alphabet is a tale of two Googles:\\xa0Today marks the one year anniversary of the day Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin picked a new name and an audacious corporate structure in an attempt to spawn gigantic tech businesses in industries way beyond web search.\\xa0So far, the year has been great for Google. Unshackled from the unprofitable moonshots, its balance sheet and steady ads business growth has reassured investors. The business soars: Revenues topped 21 percent growth last quarter and operating margins keep getting fatter.\\xa0More focus: One senior exec at Google recently explained a key change from the Alphabet reorg: Before, meetings cluttered with discussion of extraneous projects — the self-driving cars, medical doodads and internet balloons. Now, Google meetings are spent on Google alone.\\xa0Porat appeases Wall Street: Not too long ago, investors were making fretful phone calls about Google’s abundant spending. Not anymore. Thank Ruth Porat, the former Morgan Stanley CFO who helped orchestrate the Alphabet reshuffle. “Implementing a competitive culture in what was becoming a behemoth — that’s critical,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. “Ruth Porat has been priced into the stock.”\\xa0About that stock: It has climbed nearly 24 percent since August 10th of last year. It’s been bumpier for “Other Bets,” the hodgepodge, ever-evolving group of companies outside of Google that Page and Brin desperately want to behave like lean, world-changing startups.\\xa0Losses added: Alphabet poured $859 million into these units last quarter, nearly $300 million more than the same quarter last year.\\xa0New equity: Employees at the non-Google company may soon have to get used to new stock packages — ones that aren’t tied to that soaring Google.\\n\\n\\n\\nChina\\'s JD.com revenue meets expectations as slowdown set to continue:\\xa0JD.com Inc, China\\'s second biggest e-commerce company, reported revenue for the second quarter of 2016 that was within company forecasts, even as the growth rate continued a steady decline that is expected to continue.\\xa0The company said on Wednesday revenue for the quarter rose 42 percent to 65.2 billion yuan ($9.83 billion), within JD.com\\'s forecast range of 64.2-66.2 billion yuan.\\xa0But the company is predicting an even sharper decline in growth for the third quarter, compounding concerns that China\\'s e-commerce sector is saturating. JD.com\\'s revenue from Amazon-like online direct sales rose 40 percent in the quarter, versus a 67 percent jump in sales from services and other businesses.JD.com now expects revenues for the third quarter to be 59-61 billion yuan, a rise of 34-38 percent from the same quarter in 2015.\\xa0Net losses were 132.1 million yuan ($19.92 million), compared to a loss of 510.4 million yuan in the previous year. The total value of merchandise transactions on JD.com\\'s platforms was 108.7 billion yuan in the quarter, up 47 percent excluding online marketplace Paipai.com, which JD.com shut down. JD.com shares were up around 3 percent at $23.10 in pre-market trading in New York, but well below the $29.53 price at the beginning of the year.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nVC Funding Is Drying Up for Media Startups:\\xa0As venture capitalists exercise more caution and place fewer bets, they’re leaving media startups behind.\\xa0Venture funding to media-tech companies slid for the third consecutive quarter to $91.7 million, the lowest amount since mid-2013, according to data from industry researcher CB Insights. Investment activity followed a similar trend, declining to the fewest number of deals since the second quarter of 2012.\\xa0While U.S. venture deals were down overall in the first half of the year, the drop in funding to media companies has outpaced declines in other sectors, said Garrett Black, an analyst at researcher PitchBook. Investors worry the businesses are expensive to run compared with software makers and struggle to keep readers’ attention.The decline in venture funding comes amid a moment of reckoning across the digital media landscape. Web publishers like Mashable Inc. and International Business Times have fired dozens of employees this year. Smaller players are seeking new business models as they struggle to sustain themselves on digital advertising, which is being increasingly dominated by Google and Facebook Inc. Many of them are shifting their business to focus on web video, where advertising rates are higher.\\xa0Media hasn’t traditionally been the top investment area for VCs, but some big wins drew interest to the sector. AOL spent $315 million to acquire the Huffington Post in 2011, and the publication has become a cornerstone of Verizon Communications Inc.’s media strategy since it bought AOL. German publisher Axel Springer SE took over Business Insider last year in a $343 million deal, a win for backers including Institutional Venture Partners and Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos.\\n\\n\\nBill Maris, the CEO and founder of Google Ventures, is leaving:\\xa0Bill Maris, the founder and chief of Google Ventures (or GV), is leaving the firm and its parent, Alphabet,Recode has learned. His last day, said sources, is Friday.\\xa0Maris would be the third high-ranking executive to depart from the Alphabet units outside of the main Google search business in recent months, as the tech giant continues to stumble through the transition into its new corporate structure.\\xa0Sources say Maris is being replaced by David Krane, a managing partner for the venture arm and one of the earliest corporate communications managers at Google.Maris, an early web entrepreneur, founded Google’s venture capital arm in 2009 and quickly built it into a formidable presence in Silicon Valley. In 2015, the firm managed upwards of $2.4 billion in capital.\\xa0Although GV cut back on investments in Europe and with early stage companies, the firm is still willing to cut checks. For the first six months of this year, it passed Intel Capital as the most active corporate venture arm, according to CB Insights.\\xa0Under Maris, GV has had some high-profile misses — most notably, the disastrous app Secret. But those were outweighed by early bets in gigantic startups like Uber, Nest, Slack and Jet.com, which just went to Walmart for $3 billion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYelp swings to surprise profit, raises full-year revenue forecast:\\xa0Consumer review website operator Yelp Inc swung to an unexpected second-quarter profit and raised its full-year revenue forecast as investments in sales and marketing led to more businesses and consumers signing up for its services.\\xa0The company also gave a better-than-expected revenue forecast for the current quarter and said it partnered with and made a small investment in Nowait, a mobile platform that allows restaurants to manage their waiting lists.\\xa0Shares of Yelp, whose website and app allow users to rate restaurants and a variety of other businesses, jumped more than 13 percent to $35.90 in extended trading on Tuesday. They hit a 52-week high of $32.90 in regular trading.\\xa0Yelp posted a net profit of $449,000, or 1 cent per share, for quarter ended June 30, compared with a net loss of $1.3 million a year earlier and $15.5 million in the prior quarter.\\xa0Revenue rose 29.5 percent to $173.4 million.\\n\\n\\nP&G, the biggest advertiser in the world, reminded us why Facebook wants to be TV:\\xa0Facebook is a giant, mega-successful advertising business.\\xa0It has 1.7 billion users, and it knows a ton about them, which is why it did $17 billion in ad revenue last year.\\xa0But despite years of trying to convince advertisers otherwise, Facebook is still not TV — the place advertisers go when they want to spend huge sums on brand advertising, meant to create overall awareness of their products.\\xa0Instead, Facebook is the place advertisers go for direct response ads: Ads that send you somewhere when you click on them, so you can buy or download something immediately. Facebook is better at DR ads than anyone — see that second sentence at the top — but DR ads are of limited use for some advertisers.\\xa0We got a reminder of that today, when the Wall Street Journal reported that P&G, the world’s biggest advertiser, was going to pull back on the targeted ads it was running on Facebook, because targeted ads weren’t helping P&G sell Tide and Pampers.\\xa0But P&G is increasing its TV budget.\\xa0P&G isn’t cutting back on its overall Facebook spend, and this news isn’t going to be a long-term problem for Facebook.\\n\\n\\nVirtual Reality Classrooms Another Way Chinese Kids Gain an Edge:\\xa0Deep within a building shaped like the Starship Enterprise, a little-known Chinese company is working on the future of education. Vast banks of servers record children at work and play, tracking touchscreen swipes, shrugs and head swivels - amassing a database that will be used to build intimate profiles of millions of kids. This is the Fuzhou hive of NetDragon Websoft Holdings Ltd. a hack-and-slash videogame maker and unlikely candidate to transform learning via headset-mounted virtual reality teachers. It’s one of a growing number of companies from International Business Machines Corp. to Lenovo Group Ltd. studying how to use technology like VR to arrest a fickle child’s attention. (And perhaps someday to make a mint from that data by showing them ads.) China - where parents have been known to try anything to give their kids an edge and tend to be less obsessive about privacy - may be an ideal testing ground for the VR classroom of the future. As it’s envisioned, there’ll be no napping in the back row. Lessons change when software predicts a student’s mind is wandering by spotting an upward tilt of the head. Dull lectures can be immediately livened up with pop quizzes. Even the instructor’s gender can change to suit the audience, such as making the virtual educator male in cultures where teachers are typically men.The notion of adaptive, computer-based teaching has bounced around for more than a decade. Done right, it’s got the potential to fundamentally alter learning. Educators who’ve relied on their gut and visual cues could be replaced or augmented by digital avatars powered by algorithms, which can in turn be replicated across the planet. Advocates argue that the benefits of using machines to scrutinize children and learning to adapt to their foibles will outweigh questions of privacy because soon there won’t be enough human teachers.\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook Blocks Ad Blockers, but It Strives to Make Ads More Relevant:\\xa0Digital ads pop up online so frequently and ubiquitously that many people are using software to block them.\\xa0But if you try to stop ads from showing up onFacebook’s desktop website, you will now be out of luck: The social network has found a way to block the ad blockers.\\xa0On Tuesday, Facebook flipped a switch on its desktop website that essentially renders all ad blockers — the programs that prevent websites from displaying ads on the page when a user visits the site — useless. The change allows the Silicon Valley company to serve ads on its desktop site even to people who have ad-blocking software installed and running.Facebook’s move is set to add to a furious debate about the ethics of ad blocking. On one hand, many digital ads are a nuisance — they slow loading times of web pages and detract from the online experience. Yet the ads also serve as the business foundation for many digital publishers to provide content to readers.\\xa0Ad blockers have become a threat to publishers including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, which are facing declining advertising revenue. About 200 million people worldwide use ad-blocking software on their desktop computers, according to estimates from PageFair, an anti-ad-blocking start-up. An additional 420 million use ad blockers on their smartphones, the company said.\\xa0Several digital publishers, including Wired, Forbes and The Times, have begun experimenting with anti-ad-blocking techniques, including asking visitors who use ad blockers to “whitelist” their sites so that ads may still appear.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia ride-hailing firm Ola sideswiped as Uber, Didi team up in China:\\xa0Didi Chuxing\\'s acquisition of Uber\\'s China business last week reshapes the landscape in Asia\\'s growing ride-hailing sector, and leaves India\\'s Ola more vulnerable to attack by Uber in its $12 billion home market.\\xa0Four months ago, Ola executives met with Didi hoping the Chinese firm would invest fresh capital to help it fight Uber Technologies Inc which, with its deeper pockets, has made rapid inroads into India.\\xa0They were told Didi wanted first to sort out its own challenges in China, said a person with direct knowledge of Ola\\'s plans. Didi and Uber have raised and spent billions of dollars in a discount slugfest to win drivers, passengers and market share in China.\\xa0Didi, now worth around $35 billion, last year invested about $30 million in Ola, which is also backed by Japan\\'s SoftBank Group, and the two are allies in an anti-Uber group that also includes U.S.-based Lyft and Southeast Asia-focused Grab.\\xa0\"This (Didi/Uber China) deal changes the dynamics of how they (Didi) will invest in India,\" said the person, who didn\\'t want to be named because the discussions were private. If Didi invests more in Ola, it\\'s effectively betting against Uber, its new partner in China, the person said.\\xa0It\\'s not clear whether Didi would provide equity or debt to Ola, which has raised around $1.3 billion in funding and is valued at over $5 billion. SoftBank Capital, Ola\\'s key investor, faces its own financial issues and is selling assets to raise cash and reduce debt, which may pose another fundraising challenge for Ola, which was aiming to raise another $1 billion this year.After the Didi deal, Uber is even more focused on India, which it has previously called its No. 2 priority overseas market, doubling down on resources, staffing and technology deployed there, said two people familiar with Uber\\'s plans, one of whom is based in the United States.\\n\\n\\nTwitter Seeks to Sublease Part of San Francisco Headquarters:\\xa0Twitter Inc. is offering about a quarter of the space at its San Francisco headquarters complex for sublease, adding to a growing amount of excess offices available in the city as the technology industry cools.\\xa0About 78,800 square feet (7,320 square meters) is listed for sublease on the seventh floor of 1355 Market St., a renovated 1930s furniture mart, and 104,850 square feet is available along three floors in an adjacent building at One Tenth St., according to marketing materials from Cresa, a commercial real estate firm.Subleasing is becoming more prevalent in San Francisco as venture-capital investments decline and tech firms slow their hiring from a breakneck pace. While the city’s overall office market remains strong, extra space is a warning sign that some companies overestimated their growth rate and are being forced to scale back. An increase in subleasing predated commercial real estate downturns following the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bust in the late 1990s.\\n\\n\\nWalmart was the only bidder in $3 billion Jet.com acquisition:\\xa0When news first broke of Walmart’s interest in acquiring Jet.com, the $3 billion price tag was a surprise to many. Why would Walmart pay such a premium for a startup that was unprofitable and just a year old?\\xa0One hypothesis was that Walmart may have been competing against other bidders for Jet — possibly Alibaba or even Google.\\xa0Turns out that was not the case, Jet CEO Marc Lore told Recode in an interview Monday afternoon.\\xa0“This was about trust between Doug and I,” Lore said in reference to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, noting that the conversations between the two sides began in the spring.\\xa0“It never occurred to me to go out and get another offer, quite honestly,” he added. \\xa0As part of the deal, Lore will take over as head of Walmart.com in addition to Jet, as Recode first reportedSunday evening. Neil Ashe, Walmart’s CEO of global e-commerce, will depart at the end of Walmart’s fiscal year.\\xa0In a conference call with reporters, McMillon outlined why Walmart found Jet so valuable. It was a combination of the speed of the shopping site’s growth (a $1 billion annualized sales volume run rate within eight months of launch); the expertise of the exec team led by Lore that is joining Walmart in the deal; and the proprietary pricing and back-end technology that is expected to eventually be used in some capacity on Walmart.com.\\n\\n\\n\\nLendingClub turmoil takes toll as company posts widening losses:\\xa0LendingClub Corp on Monday reported its largest quarterly loss in a year as it struggles to bring banks back to its online lending platform following the departure of its chief executive and a scandal involving altered loan documents.\\xa0LendingClub, which matches borrowers and lenders via an online marketplace, reported a second-quarter loss of $81.4 million, or 21 cents per share, compared to a loss of $4.1 million, or 1 cent per share, a year ago.\\xa0The company also continued its executive shakeup, with the resignation of Chief Financial Officer Carrie Dolan. Her departure is the first high-profile exit since the departure of Renaud Laplanche, the company\\'s founder, as chief executive on May 9.The second-quarter earnings report follows a tumultuous period for LendingClub, once considered the standard bearer in a new generation of online lenders but which has been pummeled by revelations of lending improprieties, a U.S. Department of Justice investigation, the departure of loan investors and layoffs of 179 employees.\\xa0\"The good thing is (the second quarter) is now behind us,\" said Scott Sanborn, who took over as president and CEO in June. \"We have accomplished quite a bit since the events of May 9.\"\\xa0LendingClub\\'s shares were down more than 2 percent at about $4.68 in after-hours trading. That puts the company\\'s market cap at about $1.8 billion, about one-third its market value of about $5.4 billion when it went public in December 2014 in an offering priced at $15 a share.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAirbnb raising a reported $850M at a $30B valuation:\\xa0Almost a year after its last raise of $1.6 billion, the company is said to be adding $850 million to its coffers, according to information obtained by Equidate.\\xa0While $850 million is a ton of cash, it is not the largest round the company has raised. Last year, the company raised $1.5 billion in one of the largest VC rounds in history. The additional capital would only move Airbnb from the fifth to the forth most valuable tech unicorn at a potential valuation of $30 billion (tear). \\xa0Even as a late-stage company, Airbnb has to be increasingly conscious of the capital it takes on. Too much equity dilutes early investors, while too much debt could put investors at risk if valuations were to suddenly tank. Debt as an asset class is paid off before equity.\\xa0Airbnb has notoriously taken actions to strategically prolong an IPO, bringing on a $1 billion credit faculty last year to support growth without diluting investors.\\xa0The company previously had an approximate valuation of $27 billion, so while the round is large, it doesn’t deviate from prior anti-dilution strategies. With respect to deals that Airbnb reportedly walked away from, the $850 million dollar deal is tame. The Wall Street Journalreported that Airbnb left money on the table, rejecting a deal that would have valued the company at $34 billion.\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle keeps finding new and creative ways to piss off Yelp and TripAdvisor:\\xa0There’s no love lost between Yelp and Google. And, more recently, between TripAdvisor and Google, too.\\xa0Now, Google is giving those companies a new reason to believe that the search giant is intentionally pushing listings from their review sites way down in search rankings.\\xa0The most recent brouhaha centers on a new search feature that highlights critic reviews of restaurants from sites like Zagat, which Google owns, as well as “best of” lists from publishers.\\xa0The end result, as shown below in a tweet from Yelp’s CEO, is that Yelp and TripAdvisor reviews don’t show up even if you scroll down to the second screen of results on a phone. In this instance, you would have to scroll to the third screen to see Yelp reviews.Both Yelp and TripAdvisor have been complainants in the European Union’s case against Google for anticompetitive practices. These companies continue to believe that Google intentionally promotes its own products — like local reviews of restaurants and hotels — over others, including theirs. Google denies this.\\xa0Google has historically been a large source of traffic for both review companies, so it’s been critical for them to get people to frequent their apps on mobile phones rather than search for local spots through Google.\\xa0A Google spokeswoman declined to comment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBitfinex exchange customers to get 36 percent haircut, debt token:\\xa0Crypto-currency exchange Bitfinex, which lost $72 million to hackers last week, told customers on Sunday they would lose just over 36 percent of the assets they had on the platform but would be compensated for these losses with tokens of credit.\\xa0The Hong Kong-based exchange said losses from the theft would be shared, or \"generalized\", across all the company\\'s clients and assets, widening the group of those affected announced last week.\\xa0\"This is the closest approximation to what would happen in a liquidation context,\" Bitfinex said on its website early on Sunday.\\xa0\"Upon logging into the platform, customers will see that they have experienced a generalized loss percentage of 36.067 percent.\"\\xa0The company said it would also give all affected clients a \"BFX\" token crediting their losses that could be redeemed by the exchange or for shares in iFinex, the exchange\\'s parent company.\\xa0Bitfinex said it would explain its methodology in a later update and that it was talking to investors about how to fully compensate its customers.\\xa0Hackers stole 119,756 bitcoin from Bitfinex last week in the second-biggest breach of a crypto-currency exchange ever, in U.S. dollar terms.

      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMeet the China ‘whisperers’ who get the big deals done in Silicon Valley:\\xa0When Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick wanted advice about whom to hire to run his ride-hailing business in China, he asked Carmen Chang, a longtime Silicon Valley lawyer and investor who had helped a previous generation of tech companies navigate that murky territory.\\xa0When Uber sold its China business to its rival Didi this week, Chang was a trusted confidante.When Lyft, Uber’s smaller rival, needed an entree into China, the company’s president turned to another Silicon Valley insider who shuttles between worlds. The introduction from Connie Chan, a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, to China’s largest ride-hailing company led to a $100 million investment and partnership.\\xa0Behind the scenes of an unprecedented flood of capital from China into Silicon Valley over the past two years is an elite network of brokers. These brokers do more than deal-making; they play anthropologist and cultural translator -- from coaching startup founders about the culturally appropriate place to sit at a conference room table in China to breaking down how emojis are used in Chinese apps. Their acumen is growing more valuable, entrepreneurs say, as they navigate a cast of hard-to-parse characters with alluring deep pockets and promises of big business opportunities overseas.\\xa0“She is the whisperer between China and Silicon Valley,” said Matthew Prince, chief executive of Cloudflare, a web security startup, of Chang. Last year, Chang helped Prince -- whose company had given up on China in 2011 -- clinch a partnership with Baidu, China’s search giant. “There’s very few that really understand both sides.”\\xa0Chang, who was born in Nanjing, China, came to the States to seek a doctorate in Modern Chinese History. She got pulled into tech industry after graduating from Stanford Law School in the early 1990s, when she got a job as an associate at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, the Silicon Valley firm known for its ties to the clubby venture capitalists on Sand Hill Road.\\xa0One of her early clients was Masayoshi Son, the billionaire Japanese investor who founded the Japanese telcommunications giant Softbank. At the time, she said, senior management at the firm had never been to Asia, and Son “wasn’t considered important enough” to be represented by a general partner. “So he got an associate,” she says.\\n\\n\\nSnapchat Used to Spook Advertisers. Not Anymore. When Snapchat opened itself up to advertisers more than a year ago, many initially griped that the company needed to lower its ad prices. Some were mystified about how to reach the right audience with the ads, since Snapchat did not provide traditional ad-targeting tools. Most of all, brands wondered how Snapchat could be effective when the ads — like Snapchat messages — disappeared.\\xa0In the last 15 months, Snapchat has moved to respond. It introduced new ad formats. It dangled its attractive user base — the service now claims 150 million daily users, including nearly half the country’s population from ages 18 to 34 — to lure advertisers. Most important, Snapchat has persuaded brands like Tiffany & Company, Kraft Foods and Burger King that its ads let them interact playfully with this young audience.Now Snapchat faces the challenge of keeping up its nascent ad business as its early success raises the competitive hackles of rivals. On Tuesday, Instagram, the photo-sharing app owned by Facebook, introduced a near carbon copy of a Snapchat photo and video service known as Stories.\\xa0A lot is riding on Snapchat’s building up its ad business. The company, which Mr. Spiegel helped found in 2011 and is now based in the Venice Beach neighborhood of Los Angeles, needs to justify a valuation of about $19 billion that its investors have placed on it. The company also faces sky-high revenue expectations; the investment bank Jefferies recently projected that Snapchat’s revenue would grow to $1 billion next year from more than $350 million this year.Mr. Khan’s biggest job was to explain why Snapchat’s unusual platform was better for advertisers. The task was thorny because Snapchat is a messaging, sharing and broadcast service where most content disappears. Companies had few comparable apps to judge Snapchat against.\\xa0The potential became clearer after brands started experimenting with Snapchat’s geofilters, a tool that adds custom stickers, a type of colorful icon, to the app when people enter a certain geographic area, and lenses, which are whimsical images that transform someone’s face in the app.\\n\\n\\nFacebook\\'s News Feed to show fewer \\'clickbait\\' headlines:\\xa0Facebook\\'s News Feed will show fewer \"clickbait\" headlines over the next few weeks, the company announced Thursday, as it seeks to establish itself as the prime web destination for news and social updates.\\xa0The company receives thousands of complaints a day about clickbait, headlines that intentionally withhold information or mislead users to get people to click on them, Adam Mosseri, vice president of product management for News Feed, said in an interview.\\xa0In an effort to eliminate clickbait from the site, Facebook created a system that identifies and classifies such headlines. It can then determine which pages or web domains post large amounts of clickbait and rank them lower in News Feed.\\xa0Facebook routinely updates its algorithm for News Feed, the place most people see postings on the site, to show users what they are most interested in and encourage them to spend even more time on the site.\\xa0The system looks for commonly used phrases in clickbait headlines, similar to how filters for email spam work, Facebook said in a blog post. It categorized tens of thousands of headlines as clickbait by looking for headlines that intentionally withheld information and those that exaggerated the content of an article.\\xa0News Feed, a team of about 200 people, uses a similar classification system to determine what it should show each user, Mosseri said.\\n\\n\\nAmazon adds several new devices to its Dash Replenishment auto ordering service:\\xa0At the beginning of the year, Amazon flipped the switch on Dash Replenishment, a service aimed at bringing the instant reordering of its devoted product buttons directly to connected devices. The idea being that you don’t have to, say, order ink for your printer or batteries for your smart lock — the devices will do it for you.\\xa0The retail giant has already announced a slew of different partners for the program, including Brother Printers, the Gmate SMART blood glucose monitor and a GE washing machine, all of which went live in the first round.\\xa0Today the company announced a number of new additions. The highest profile of the additions is GE, which will be extending its involvement to driers and dishwashers, which will be updated to order fabric softener and dishwasher detergent, respectively, when supplies start to dwindle.\\xa0Neato joins the list as well, bringing the Wi-Fi-connected robot to the service to order replacement filters and brushes, while Petcube’s Kickstarter-supported Bites camera will be able to order pet food. Also on the list are the Behmore Connected coffee brewer, Simplehuman trashcan and SmartThings platform.\\xa0Even The Hershey Company has been added to the stable with an unnamed device. That should be interesting.\\n\\n\\nLinkedIn Results Beat Expectations Ahead of Microsoft Deal:\\xa0LinkedIn Corp. reported earnings and revenue that were higher than analysts expected, after the company negotiated a $26.2 billion sale to Microsoft Corp. LinkedIn said second-quarter revenue was $933 million, up 31 percent from a year earlier. The average analyst estimate was $899 million. Earnings, excluding some items, were $1.13 cents per share in the second quarter, compared with analysts’ projection of 78 cents. This may be LinkedIn’s last earnings report as an independent company, before it joins Microsoft in one of the largest technology industry deals on record.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAs Chinese hacking abates, FireEye plans layoffs, cuts forecasts; shares plunge:\\xa0Cyber security firm FireEye Inc said on Thursday it planned to lay off 300 to 400 of its 3,400 workers as it announced quarterly sales below its own forecast, due to a slowdown in demand for its services helping businesses respond to hacking attacks.\\xa0FireEye\\'s shares were down 16.2 percent at $14.02 in extended trading.Chief Executive Kevin Mandia said the company is now responding more frequently to financially driven cyber criminals, who engage in crimes such as ransomware, which are relatively simple to clean up.\\xa0\"The size and scope have changed. The whole remediation was more complex\" when the company was responding to large numbers of state-sponsored hacks from China, he said.\\xa0FireEye cut its full-year revenue forecast to $716 million-$728 million from $780 million-$810 million.Executives blamed much of the trouble on a slowdown in its services business, including its high-profile Mandiant forensics unit that helps organizations respond to cyber attacks.\\xa0That division\\'s revenue rose just 2 percent in the second quarter, compared to a 40 percent increase in the first quarter. Its total number of engagements rose, but average revenue from each one fell dramatically because work performed was less extensive.\\xa0Mandia said that was due to a shift away from previous years where there were large numbers of state-sponsored espionage hackers from China attacking customers in the United States.\\xa0FireEye and other cyber security firms said in June that cyber espionage attacks from China appeared to have dropped this year as the Chinese government made good on a pledge with the United States to stop supporting the digital theft of U.S. trade secrets.\\n\\n\\nZynga plummets 9% in after-hours trading:\\xa0Social game developer Zynga tumbled 9 percent in after-hours trading following the second quarter 2016 earnings announcement after the bell today. The company reported a net loss of $4.4 million, while still beating analysts’ expectations in terms of revenue.For the second quarter ended June 30, the San Francisco-based maker of FarmVille and Words with Friends posted revenue of $181.7 million and non-GAAP net earnings came in at $0.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nGrand Theft Auto\\' publisher Take-Two\\'s revenue jumps 13 percent:\\xa0Videogame publisher Take-Two Interactive Software Inc reported a 13 percent rise in revenue, helped by strong sales of its \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"NBA 2K16\" titles.\\xa0Take-Two, like its rivals, has also benefited from a shift by players downloading digital copies of its videogames – which generate higher margins – rather than buying physical game discs.\\xa0Take Two\\'s net revenue rose to $311.55 million in the first quarter ended June 30 from $257.30 million a year earlier.\\xa0Digital downloads accounted for about 55 percent of revenue in the quarter.\\xa0Net loss narrowed to $38.57 million, or 46 cents per share, from $67.02 million, or 81 cents per share.\\n\\n\\nActivision revenue surges on \"Overwatch\" launch, \"Candy Crush\" deal:\\xa0Activision Blizzard Inc reported a 50.4 percent surge in quarterly revenue on Thursday, propelled by the popularity of the newly-launched \"Overwatch\" game and the boost from the acquisition of \"Candy Crush\" maker King Digital.\\xa0Activision\\'s total adjusted revenue, which excludes deferred revenue and related costs, rose to $1.57 billion in the second quarter ended June 30 from $1.04 billion a year earlier.The company\\'s shares were up 1.4 percent at $41.40 in extended trading.\\xa0Activision, best known for its \"Call of Duty\" and \"World of Warcraft\" games, released \"Overwatch\" on May 24 to rave reviews. The multi-player futuristic game now has more than 15 million players and has generated about $500 million in revenue to date, excluding deferrals, the company said.\\xa0The company\\'s net income dropped 40 percent to $127 million, or 17 cents per share, mainly due to costs associated with the near $6 billion acquisition of King Digital in February.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTesla misses Q2 earnings, delivers 14,402 vehicles:\\xa0Tesla missed its Q2 earnings targets today in a report released after the close of the market. Tesla executives are not wavering on yearly targets, despite a slower than expected quarter. All of this comes amidst a seemingly never-ending wave of Tesla headlines dominating Silicon Valley over the last few weeks.\\xa0The energy company born out of an automobile company reported non-GAAP Q2 revenue of $1.56 billion up from last year’s Q2 revenue of $1.2 billion. The company came close but ultimately missed analyst estimates of $1.6 billion.\\xa0Tesla closed down 0.62 percent today at $225.79. After the news was released, Tesla shares moved up almost instantly in after-hours trading after the news dropped but have been fluctuating up and down by 2 percent since.Wall Street analysts expected an adjusted net loss of $52 cents a share but found themselves with a worse than expected loss of $1.06 per share.\\xa0Tesla delivered 14,402 new vehicles consisting of 9,764 Model S and 4,638 Model X in Q2, slightly ahead of last month’s estimates.\\xa0Tesla had originally aimed to deliver 80,000 vehicles by the end of the year. It is growing tougher by the day for the company to hit that goal. On the bright side, the company noted that almost half of Q2 production occurred in the final four weeks of the quarter. Moreover, Tesla had an additional 5,000 cars in transit at the quarter end on their way to be delivered.\\n\\n\\nWhy it makes sense for Walmart to buy Jet.com — even for $3 billion:\\xa0Walmart missed out on a Marc Lore company once, when Amazon swooped in to beat it to the purchase of Diapers.com’s parent company several years back. The giant retailer may not let it happen again. Walmart is in talks to acquire Jet.com, Lore’s new startup that has raised more than $800 million in financing in an attempt to build a new online megastore, according to a person familiar with the talks. It is not clear how far along they are. News of the talks was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, which said the tie-up could value Jet at as much as $3 billion. A Walmart spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. A Jet spokesman declined to comment. A $3 billion price tag would be a steep one for Walmart, considering that Jet is largely still unproven and burning more than $20 million a month on advertising alone. A deal would also certainly not be what Lore had in mind when he set out to build a legitimate competitor to Amazon, Walmart and others after his non-compete agreement with the Seattle-based retailer expired two years ago. But it would be a marriage of necessity for both sides, and one that probably makes too much sense not to happen. On the Walmart side, its e-commerce efforts have largely been viewed as a failure in recent years for a retailer of its size and power. Annual revenue for the division is around $14 billion, compared to $99 billion for Amazon, excluding Amazon’s AWS cloud computing unit.Five years ago, it would have seemed possible, but unlikely, that Walmart could catch up with Amazon. Today, that notion is laughable.For Lore and Jet, the deal would be something of a shocker. Lore pocketed dozens of millions of dollars when he sold Diapers.com to Amazon so he doesn’t exactly need the money. That’s one of the reasons his backers believed him when he said his goal was to build a company worth tens of billions. But the hurdles to get there have been significant from the start and perhaps even larger than Lore imagined. Jet only really works long-term as a standalone company if it can convince millions of people to order multiple items at a time to earn discounts; individual product prices aren’t typically better than its competitors.\\n\\n\\nDorsey\\'s Square reports 41.5 percent jump in quarterly revenue:\\xa0Mobile payments company Square Inc on Wednesday reported a 41.5 percent jump in revenue and diminishing losses as more large merchants make sales using Square\\'s technology, a sign the company has moved beyond serving only pop-up shops and food trucks.Square stock was up more than 14 percent to about $12 in after-hours trading following the second-quarter earnings call. The price at closing bell was $10.44.\\xa0Square\\'s revenue reached $438.5 million, up 41.5 percent from its earnings of $310.0 million a year earlier. It processed $12.5 billion in payments, up 42 percent from a year ago, mostly due to new and larger retailers using Square, the company said.\\xa0About 42 percent of total payments is coming from larger retailers, signaling a dramatic transition for Square. The company started seven years ago as a card reader that turns a mobile phone into a payment terminal, and was sold primarily to pop-up stores, coffee shops, food trucks and other small merchants that couldn\\'t afford elaborate payment systems.Square, which went public in November, has expanded to offer an array of services for businesses such as point-of-sale registers, invoice software and loans.\\xa0Square Capital, the loan program, saw a 123 percent increase over last year, with $189 million in loans made to businesses. Square added five investors to the program, which will provide capital for additional borrowers, said Sarah Friar, Square chief financial officer. About 90 percent of borrowers renew their loans.Friar said Square\\'s familiarity with borrowers - the company lends to merchants it has already done business with - and the low cost of the program distinguishes it from other lenders.Still, the company is not profitable. Its losses narrowed to $27.3 million from $29.6 million during the same period last year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChina, Not Silicon Valley, Is Cutting Edge in Mobile Tech:\\xa0Snapchat and Kik, the messaging services, use bar codes that look like drunken checkerboards to connect people and share information with a snap of their smartphone cameras. Facebook is working on adding the ability to hail rides and make payments within its Messenger app. Facebook and Twitter have begun live-streaming video.\\xa0All of these developments have something in common: The technology was first popularized in China.\\xa0WeChat and Alipay, two Chinese apps, have long used the bar-codelike symbols — called QR codes — to let people pay for purchases and transfer money. Both let users hail a taxi or order a pizza without switching to another app. The video-streaming service YY.com has for years made online stars of young Chinese people posing, chatting and singing in front of video cameras at home.\\xa0Silicon Valley has long been the world’s tech capital: It birthed social networking and iPhones and spread those tech products across the globe. The rap on China has been that it always followed in the Valley’s footsteps as government censorship abetted the rise of local versions of Google, YouTube and Twitter.\\xa0But China’s tech industry — particularly its mobile businesses — has in some ways pulled ahead of the United States. Some Western tech companies, even the behemoths, are turning to Chinese firms for ideas.China’s largest internet companies are the only ones in the world that rival America’s in scale. The purchase this week of Uber China by Didi Chuxing after a protracted competition shows that at least domestically, Chinese players can take on the most sophisticated and largest start-ups coming out of America.Industry leaders point to a number of areas where China jumped first. Before the online dating app Tinder, people in China used an app called Momo to flirt with nearby singles. Before the Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos discussed using drones to deliver products, Chinese media reported that a local delivery company, S.F. Express, was experimenting with the idea. WeChat offered speedier in-app news articles long before Facebook, developed a walkie-talkie function before WhatsApp, and made major use of QR codes well before Snapchat.\\xa0Before Venmo became the app for millennials to transfer money in the United States, both young and old in China were investing, reimbursing each other, paying bills,and buying products from stores with smartphone-based digital wallets.\\n\\n\\n\\nInstagram\\'s Snapchat-like feature allows 24-hour-limit posts:\\xa0Users of Instagram, a photo-sharing app owned by Facebook Inc , can now post picture and video slideshows that last 24 hours, a feature similar to the signature function of social media rival Snapchat.\\xa0Snapchat, which launched in 2011, got its initial boost from millennials, especially teenagers, who value the privacy that the app offers. Text messages disappear right after they are read, and posts expire after 24 hours.\\xa0As with Snapchat, the new Instagram Stories feature allows its 500 million members to annotate their posts with emojis, doodles and texts, Instagram said in a blog post on Tuesday.\\xa0The feature is the latest salvo between Facebook, which bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012, and Snapchat, which rejected Facebook\\'s $3 billion buyout offer just three years ago, as they try to attract more users.\\xa0Snapchat is popular with younger people who want to shield their posts from the eyes of their parents, who are more likely to be on Facebook, whose 1.7 billion monthly users tend to be older. Snapchat recently surpassed Twitter Inc in daily users and is valued at around $18 billion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLyft hit a record of 14 million rides last month with run-rate revenue of as much as $500 million:\\xa0July was a record month for Lyft, which performed 13.9 million rides, according to a letter the company sends its investors on a monthly basis that Recode obtained.That’s 1.5 million more rides, or 12 percent more, than the company performed in June 2016 and amounts to 167 million rides on an annual run-rate basis, according to the document.\\xa0The company also hit more than $2 billion in what it calls net ride value for the first time in its history, on a run-rate basis. Net ride value — not to be confused with Lyft’s revenue — is the amount passengers pay without accounting for tips and tolls. Lyft takes anywhere from 20 to 25 percent of the fare, which means the company’s run-rate revenue for the year is between $400 million and $500 million.\\xa0The leaked document comes at a time when the company is under pressure to sell right after Uber sold its China operations to homegrown competitor Didi. The two companies have essentially agreed to operate a monopoly in China after years of battling for customers and riders through price enticements that made it hard to turn profit.\\xa0Market dominance is more important than ever as ride-hailing startups look to turn a profit. Uber is likely to seek an IPO next year, and Lyft will have to find a buyer to help it better compete.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTableau Software’s Q2 earnings fall short of estimates:\\xa0Data analytics provider Tableau Software reported second quarter earnings after the bell today. The Seattle-based company posted a loss due to higher than expected expenses for the quarter, while still beating analyst’s expectations in terms of revenue. For the three months ended June 30, Tableau posted total revenue of $198.5 million Tableau Software went public in May 2013 at an initial public offering price of $31 per share. At the New York Stock Exchange trading Tuesday, the company’s shares closed down 4 cents, or less than one percent, at $56.40.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber to Sell to Rival Didi Chuxing and Create New Business in China:\\xa0In a stark signal of how difficult it is for American technology companies to thrive in China, Uber China said it was selling itself to Didi Chuxing, its fiercest rival there.\\xa0The sale, which would create a new company worth about $35 billion, would end the great ride-hailing battle of China. A person with knowledge of the deal said Uber investors had been pushing for such a transaction.\\xa0The companies have been fighting relentlessly for market share in mainland China for two years, spending tens of millions of dollars every month to attract riders and drivers. The merger would end that competition and create significant scale, but it would also be a repudiation of Uber’s ambitions to take on local Chinese competitors in their huge home market.Still, it is by no means a financial catastrophe for Uber, which for about $2 billion of investment in the Chinese market gets a $7 billion share in a company that is likely to grow. It also saves the cash it may have spent competing in China for other projects.Under the terms of the deal, the new company’s estimated worth is a combination of Didi Chuxing’s $28 billion valuation and Uber China’s $7 billion, according to two people with knowledge of the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information had not yet been made public. Uber shareholders would receive a 20 percent stake in the new company.\\xa0Didi Chuxing would also make a $1 billion investment in the company’s operations in the rest of the world, called Uber Global, which was lastvalued at $62.5 billion, according to the two people with knowledge of the sale. Bloomberg first reported news of the deal.\\n\\n\\nDidi Schools Uber on Doing Business in Cut-Throat Chinese Market:\\xa0The deal is the culmination of more than a year of take-no-prisoners war between the world’s two largest ride-sharing companies, a series of clashes played out in the media and on the dusty streets of hundreds of cities. That battle, waged through massive subsidies on rides, wound up costing Uber $2 billion, the people said. Alarmed, its investors clamored for a ceasefire.In the end, Didi proved too resourceful -- and too well-connected -- for the ride-sharing giant to dethrone. Uber threw in the towel just days after China banned the practice of charging less than the cost of a ride, depriving the U.S. company of a tried-and-true engagement tactic. In a blogpost obtained by Bloomberg before an official announcement, Kalanick portrayed the deal as a merger that strengthens both parties; others, including Grab CEO Anthony Tan, saw it as a humbled Uber taking its ball elsewhere.But Didi proved more creative, and local connections came through. The conflict took an unusual turn as third parties began to get drawn into the mix. In August, Uber complained it had been blocked from WeChat, the popular messaging service run by Didi-backer Tencent. Then Didi recruited allies, forging a four-way alliance with ride-sharing services that compete with Uber, including Lyft Inc. in the U.S., Grab and India’s Ola.\\xa0Didi gained confidence as it entered the new year. From President Jean Liu on down, its executives were determined to deal a knockout blow. Didi began raising more money and its emboldened executives openly declared victory.\\xa0“We will be the last one standing,” Stephen Zhu, vice president of strategy, said in what proved to be a prescient April address.Recent funding saw Uber’s valuation swell to $68 billion and the company said it had access to more than $11 billion on its balance sheet. Didi, said to be valued at close to $28 billion, had more than $10 billion at its disposal.\\xa0In the end, Didi proved too large an opponent, with backers including some of China’s largest government institutions and even Apple Inc. The four-year-old company now handles more than 11 million rides a day and serves about 300 million users across some 400 cities, offering taxis, private cars, ride sharing and test driving.\\n\\n\\n\\nDidi’s acquisition of Uber China throws the global anti-Uber alliance in doubt:\\xa0Didi Chuxing, China’s homegrown ride-hailing startup, was the glue that held together the global anti-Uber alliance that included Lyft, Grab and Ola. But now that Didi has acquired Uber’s China operations, that partnership has been thrown into doubt. In addition to a $1 billion investment Didi is making into Uber, the deal also brings Uber CEO Travis Kalanick onto Didi Chuxing’s board and Didi Chairman Cheng Wei onto Uber’s board. Both Kalanick and Wei are non-voting members of the board. That means, as of last night, Didi Chuxing is more invested in Uber’s success than it is in the alliance. Didi, so far, had invested about $100 million in Lyft, $350 million in Grab and $30 million in Ola, altogether about $480 million, less than half of what it just invested in Uber.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore news on this:\\xa0Uber’s surrender in China puts more pressure on big tech companies to thrive in India\\n\\n\\nDelphi, Singapore launch test of self-driving taxis:\\xa0Delphi Automotive Plc will launch a small test fleet of automated taxis in Singapore next year, aiming to ferry passengers around a city district in one of the first real-world tests of automated rides on demand, the company said on Monday.\\xa0The project, run in partnership with the Singapore Land Transport Authority, will road test a concept that many companies investing in automated driving believe offers the fastest path to making such technology commercially viable.\\xa0A cab ride in a dense urban area can cost $3 to 4 a mile, Delphi vice president of engineering Glen DeVos said in an interview. “We think we can get to 90 cents a mile” with an automated vehicle.\\xa0That drops the price of transporting goods and people, and allows for the costs of automated driving systems to be spread over hours of operation and multiple users.\\xa0Initially, the cars will have drivers ready to take over if the piloting systems fail, DeVos said. But by 2019 or 2020, “we’ll have removed drivers from the car,” Glen DeVos, Delphi’s vice president of engineering said in an interview.\\n\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft Sells $19.75 Billion of Bonds in Its Biggest Ever Sale:\\xa0Microsoft Corp. raised $19.75 billion in the third-largest U.S. corporate bond sale of the year to help finance its planned purchase of LinkedIn Corp.\\xa0Investors put in more than $50 billion of orders for the deal in the software maker’s biggest ever sale. The strong demand helped Microsoft to borrow at lower rates than it paid for the $13 billion of bonds it raised in October. It also saved about $40 million in annual interest payments compared with what it was offering to pay initially, according to people familiar with the matter.\\xa0Investors have been clamoring for U.S. corporate debt in recent months. Yields are turning negative on a growing number of bonds globally as central banks in Japan and Europe ramp up stimulus packages, spurring money managers to seek higher returns in the U.S.S&P Global Ratings assigned the bonds the top AAA grade in a note reviewing the sale on Monday. Moody’s Investors Service also gave the bonds its top grade. The longest portion of the debt is a 40-year bond that yields 1.8 percentage points above Treasuries. On Thursday, Apple Inc. sold $7 billion of bonds. Investors opened their wallets for the iPhone maker, allowing the company to lower yields on all portions of the offering, which was funding shareholder buybacks.\\xa0Like Apple, Microsoft’s debt issuance is tied to avoiding an increase in its tax bill. Companies with cash holdings from overseas profits have to pay a 35 percent tax to repatriate those funds to the U.S. Rather than use that cash to fund its acquisition and pay the hefty taxes that result, it is far cheaper for large multinationals like Microsoft to borrow the funds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA quiet news weekend, but lots of big news from Friday, which I\\'ve recapped below.\\n\\n\\nAmazon’s Profits Grow More Than 800 Percent, Lifted by Cloud Services:\\xa0For the second quarter, which ended June 30, Amazon reported net income of $857 million, or $1.78 a share, up from $92 million, or 19 cents a share, a year ago.\\xa0Revenue jumped 31 percent to $30.4 billion from $23.19 billion a year ago. Amazon’s shares rose more than 2 percent in after-hours trading after the release of its results. For most of its life, Amazon sacrificed profits if it could build another few warehouses to ship orders to customers more quickly or find some other investment to fuel its growth.\\xa0Now, it cannot avoid showing big profits thanks to the lucrative cloud computing business in which it has improbably become a leader.\\xa0On Thursday, Amazon reported net income of $857 million in its most recent quarter, the third quarter in a row in which it has shown a record profit. Its net income for those three months was also more than nine times the amount for the same period last year.\\xa0A big part of what has made Amazon’s story as a company so captivating to investors is the single-minded focus of Jeffrey P. Bezos, the company’s founder and chief executive, on making big long-term investments. Unlike Google and Facebook, which have highly profitable advertising businesses, Amazon’s retail business has operated on thin profit margins that quickly vanish when the company begins spending heavily, pushing it into the red.\\xa0What is most striking about its recent habit of showing profits is that Amazon has not suddenly become stingy about making investments. In a conference call, Amazon’s chief financial officer, Brian Olsavsky, said that the company would open 18 new fulfillment centers — the warehouses from which it processes customer orders — in the third quarter of this year, three times the number it opened in the same period last year. The retail business that Amazon is best known for is growing at a torrid pace even though it is now more than two decades old. The company’s North American retail revenue jumped 28 percent as it continued to benefit from a shift in consumer spending to online from offline stores.\\xa0The company’s spending on new warehouses and delivery services has played an important role in helping it gobble up a bigger portion of the money people spend on consumer goods.\\xa0“They are defying the laws of gravity,” said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. “It shows their level of market share gains is increasing.”\\n\\n\\nGoogle Silences Doubters With Blockbuster Quarter:\\xa0It’s good to be Google. Sometimes it’s just plain great.\\xa0Revenue regularly increases at a clip rarely achieved by firms of its size. The same goes for profits. Seven of its products have over a billion users, a scale unimaginable in the predigital era. A reorganization last year into a holding company called Alphabet, accompanied by some related high-level personnel moves, was unexpected but generally applauded.\\xa0Investors and analysts see little in the short term to disrupt this happy state of affairs, which has pushed Alphabet’s value to more than $500 billion. Those sentiments were confirmed in its second-quarter earnings report, released Thursday after the market closed. It was even better than the rosy forecasts.\\xa0Revenue rose to $21.5 billion, about $750 million more than analysts were predicting and a 21 percent jump from a year earlier.Celebration ensued. Alphabet’s shares, which drifted sideways during regular trading, immediately rose 4 percent after hours.\\n\\n\\nOracle’s $9.3 Billion Deal for NetSuite Will Bolster Its Cloud Offerings:\\xa0When Evan M. Goldberg founded NetSuite in 1998, he did so with backing from his former boss, Lawrence J. Ellison, who started the software giant Oracle.\\xa0On Thursday, their relationship came full circle as Oracle agreed to acquire NetSuite for $9.3 billion to beef up its cloud offerings.The NetSuite deal is Oracle’s largest acquisition since it bought PeopleSoft for $10.3 billion in 2004, according to data from Standard & Poor’s Global Market Intelligence. That deal, a hostile takeover fought out over 18 months, extended Oracle’s customer base and product offerings.\\xa0It made Oracle bigger, but it did not change its business model. About 5,000 PeopleSoft employees, close to half the company, were laid off in the following months.\\xa0The NetSuite purchase, on the other hand, is at the heart of Oracle’s fight to remake itself for the modern world of cloud computing, or providing accessing to vast computational resources over the internet. This transition has shaken up the software business for the last several years. Companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon have created markets worth billions, and older companies like IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Oracle have struggled to change the way they make and sell their products.The deal also illustrates that, for all the reach and novelty of tech, Silicon Valley remains a very small place with long personal histories. Mr. Goldberg got the idea for NetSuite after conversations with Mr. Ellison about where else the internet might go. Down the hall was another rising star at Oracle, named Marc Benioff.\\xa0Mr. Benioff started a company called Salesforce.com within weeks of NetSuite’s start, also with backing from Mr. Ellison. Today, Salesforce is regarded as the leading company selling only cloud software, with a market capitalization of $55.7 billion.\\xa0The relationship between Oracle and Salesforce is testy, however. In 2011, Mr. Benioff was kicked out of a big Oracle conference after he lampooned Oracle’s cloud efforts. And now the NetSuite technology will help Oracle compete more directly with Salesforce for customers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFlipkart valuation shrinks again; firm reveals job cuts:\\xa0Global asset manager T. Rowe Price Group Inc. has reduced the value of its stake in Flipkart Ltd by a fifth, its second cut in four months, reflecting continued investor concerns over the valuations of technology start-ups.\\xa0The move came ahead of a statement by Flipkart on Friday that it was cutting 300 to 600 additional jobs, after already shrinking its workforce to 30,000 from 33,000 at the start of the year to reduce costs.\\xa0US-based T. Rowe Price lowered the value of its holding in Flipkart to $96.29 per share, a 20% erosion, according to a filing the investment manager made to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the quarter ended June.\\xa0That values Flipkart at $10.3 billion, according to T. Rowe Price. The firm had earlier cut the value of its stake in Flipkart by 15% in April.On Friday, a Flipkart spokeswoman said the company had cut 300 to 600 jobs.The Economic Times reported on Friday that Flipkart was offering employees who had failed to meet expectations the choice to either resign or be sent off with severance pay, adding that the move was expected to impact 700-1,000 staff.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook trounces Wall Street estimates with sharp ad sales growth:\\xa0Facebook Inc provided more evidence on Wednesday that it can turn eyeballs into profit as the maker of the world\\'s most popular app and social website trounced Wall Street\\'s estimates, sending its shares to an all-time high.\\xa0The leading social media company\\'s mobile app and push into video attracted new advertisers and encouraged existing ones to spend more. It now has more than 1.7 billion monthly users, well ahead of any rivals.\\xa0Its shares were up 5.4 percent in after-hours trading at $130.01, after hitting their highest since the company went public in 2012.\\xa0Mobile advertising revenue accounted for 84 percent of the company\\'s total advertising revenue, compared with 76 percent a year earlier.\\xa0Total advertising revenue surged 63 percent to $6.24 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $5.80 billion.Meanwhile, Facebook still has several untapped areas for revenue opportunities, including its WhatsApp and Messenger apps, both of which have more than 1 billion users. But Wehner said the company does not plan to monetize them any time soon, and that it is instead focused on building interactions between businesses and users on the apps.\\xa0Facebook also owns picture-sharing app Instagram, which recently announced it has more than 500 million users. Facebook has yet to say how much money Instagram makes, but research firm eMarketer predicts it will make $1.5 billion in revenue this year.Total revenue rose 59.2 percent to $6.44 billion, ahead of analysts\\' average estimate of $6.02 billion.\\n\\n\\nGoPro revenue plunges 47 percent, but beats estimates:\\xa0GoPro\\'s quarterly revenue plunged 47.4 percent, but beat analysts\\' estimates, which have been sharply lowered on shrinking demand for the company\\'s body-mounted point-of-view cameras.\\xa0The company\\'s shares were up 2.4 percent in volatile trading after the bell on Wednesday.\\xa0GoPro\\'s revenue fell to $220.8 million in the second quarter ended June 30 from $419.9 million a year earlier.The company, whose cameras are worn by surfers, skydivers and other action junkies, said second-quarter units shipments rose 8 percent to 759,000 compared with the first quarter.\\xa0Its average selling price increased 11 percent sequentially and 14 percent on a year-over-year basis.\\xa0GoPro, however, maintained its full-year revenue guidance of $1.35 billion to $1.5 billion. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $1.34 billion.\\xa0GoPro posted a loss of $91.77 million, or 66 cents per share, for the second quarter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGroupon reports better-than-expected revenue, still not profitable:\\xa0Deal site Groupon saw its shares rising today in after-hours trading, following a better-than-expected second quarter earnings report.Groupon revenue in the first half of 2016 reached $1.49 billion.Groupon beat Wall Street revenue expectations with second quarter revenue of $756 million. And it posted a better-than-expected net loss of $6.8 million on a non-GAAP basis, or $0.01 loss per share.\\xa0In a phone interview, Groupon CEO Rich Williams said that the reasons the company did not make profits in the last quarter are essentially two: Groupon is still investing in marketing and other efforts to attract new customers, and they face other costs associated with company restructuring.In the first half of 2016, Groupon revenue looked better than it did over the same period last year. But the company is not looking quite as strong as it did in the first half of 2015 in terms of profitability.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple sells more iPhones than expected, shares jump after hours despite revenue drop:\\xa0Apple Inc (AAPL.O) sold more iPhones than Wall Street expected in the third quarter and estimated its revenue in the current period would top many analysts\\' targets, soothing fears that demand for the company\\'s most important product had hit a wall. Its shares rose 7 percent in after-hours trading. The world\\'s most valuable publicly traded company said it sold 40.4 million iPhones in the third quarter, down 15 percent from the year-ago quarter but slightly more than the average analyst forecast of 40.02 million, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount. IPhone sales dropped for the second straight quarter, pushing down Apple\\'s total revenue 14.6 percent in the fiscal third quarter, ended June 25. Demand for Apple\\'s phones has waned in China, partly because of economic uncertainty there, and has also slowed in more mature markets as people tend to hold on to their phones for longer. The sales slump has stoked concerns about whether the tech leader can continue to deliver profits at the level Wall Street has come to expect. \"China was a major letdown,\" said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. \"Samsung and Huawei are much more competitive now than a year ago and the Chinese economy is not doing well at all.\" Apple\\'s services business, which includes the App Store, Apple Pay, iCloud and other services, generated nearly $6 billion in revenue, up 18.9 percent from the previous year.\\xa0As iPhone sales level off, Apple is attempting to use such services to wring more revenue out of its existing base of users. The business emerged as Apple’s second largest after the iPhone for the first time in the second quarter, eclipsing gadgets such as the iPad and the Mac.\\xa0That shift bodes well for Apple because gross margins on services are better than the average for the rest of the company, Maestri said.\\n\\n\\nTwitter still has revenue problems, and its stock is down big:\\xa0Twitter reported Q2 earnings on Tuesday and investors aren’t happy. The key issue is likely Twitter’s Q3 guidance. The company says it is targeting $590 million to $610 million in revenue next quarter. Early analyst estimates pegged that number at $678 million, according to Yahoo Finance. So that’s a big discrepancy.The stock was immediately down more than 10 percent on the news and seems to be hovering there.So here’s Twitter’s dilemma: CEO Jack Dorsey has effectively been in charge of Twitter for the past year, and it’s clear that the company’s growth problem is still a problem. On top of that, Twitter has now missed revenue estimates two quarters in a row, and significantly cut its Q3 guidance. So there’s a clear revenue problem to go along with the growth problem. Not good. To state the obvious, this kind of production (or lack thereof) doesn’t help Dorsey’s case for running two companies (remember, he also runs Square). It also puts pressure on the board to consider broader options for the company, namely selling. Twitter is in the very beginning stages of trying to transition its business to look more like TV, but it doesn’t have a lot of runway left.\\n\\n\\n$1 Billion for Dollar Shave Club: Why Every Company Should Worry:\\xa0Unilever is paying $1 billion for Dollar Shave Club, a five-year-old start-up that sells razors and other personal products for men. Every other company should be afraid, very afraid. The deal anecdotally shows that no company is safe from the creative destruction brought by technological change. The very nature of a company is fundamentally changing, becoming smaller and leaner with far fewer employees. Dollar Shave Club was a phenom in the men’s grooming industry. The online business was founded in 2011 by Mark Levine and Michael Dubin to combat the high cost of razors. The idea was rather simple. Instead of paying $10 or $20 a month at a store for disposable razors, a Dollar Shave Club subscriber could go online and set up a regular order to be shipped to his home monthly at a fraction of the retail cost. The experiment was a brave one. Until that time, Gillette dominated the razor business and was in an arms race with itself to add yet more blades and other features to its razors. Gillette was so dominant in advertising and shelf space that Procter & Gamble paid $57 billion for the company in 2005. Everything changed in 2012, when Mr. Dubin’s comedic free ad posted on YouTube. Within 24 hours, the new business had more than 12,000 orders, more than it could handle. The ad went on to get over 20 million views and rocket Dollar Shave Club to over $240 million in revenue. The wealth will be spread among a few. Dollar Shave Club has over three million subscribers but only about 190 employees. Its razors were made in South Korea by Dorco. Distribution was initially handled in-house but eventually was contracted to a third-party company in Kentucky. What remained was a terrific design, marketing and customer service shop; and a business that was easily expandable to meet demand and that had a good niche with men who do not like to shop. These super-successful companies with few employees should worry an America struggling with inequality.\\xa0That is the way things roll these days. It used to be that if you wanted to sell razors, you needed a factory, a distribution center, a sales force, a research and development team and a marketing budget. Keeping all of these functions under one roof lowered transaction costs and made operations more efficient. In part this was because of communication structures — having telephone and mail together was a necessity.\\xa0But the internet, mass transportation and globalization destroy everything. If you do not believe this change is about brand, experience and disruption, know that you can buy razors directly from Dorco, presumably the same brands sold by Dollar Shave Club.\\n\\n\\nFlipkart-owned Myntra acquires Jabong for $70 mn in all-cash deal:\\xa0Flipkart-owned Myntra today said it has acquired Jabong from Global Fashion Group for USD 70 million. Myntra, which itself was acquired by Flipkart in 2014 in an estimated Rs 2,000 crore deal, will have access to a combined base of 15 million monthly active users.Jabong has been in the market for a sell-off and was in discussion with companies including Future Group, Snapdeal and Aditya Birla-owned Abof among others. Jabong was founded in 2012. In September 2014, its investor, Rocket Internet merged Jabong with four other online fashion retailers in Latin America, Russia, the Middle East, South-east Asia and Australia to create Global Fashion Group (GFG). Swedish investment firm Kinnevik also owns a large stake in Jabong\\'s parent Global Fashion Group. While Jabong has managed to reduce losses by reducing discounts, both Kinnevik and Rocket Internet seem unwilling to infuse fresh capital and are believed to be keen to exit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

The tests, which are an important sign of confidence in Britain after its historic vote last month to leave the European Union, are to begin immediately.The move puts pressure on the F.A.A., which had recently rebuffed requests by Amazon, Google and other drone makers to advance their delivery plans. The tech behemoths and other drone makers have aggressively lobbied the F.A.A. to authorize the devices to significantly reduce costs to transport goods by airplane, freight and trucks.\\xa0Amazon said it hoped success with the drone trials in Britain would encourage more hesitant regulators in the United States and elsewhere to loosen restrictions. The trials will “help identify what operating rules and safety regulations will be needed to help move the drone industry forward,” the company said in a statement.\\xa0Amazon will work with British regulators to test drones that fly beyond the line of sight of operators in rural and suburban areas. It will also test whether a single operator can safely command multiple drones at once, as well as technology that lets the machines automatically detect and avoid other planes, buildings and people.\\n\\n\\nAnalyst Downgrades Apple and Says It Has \\'Peaked\\':\\xa0With Apple Inc\\'s earnings report just a day away, Wall Street analysts are more at oddsthan ever, and one of them in particular anticipates tough times for the tech giant. \"Our opinion [is] that Apple has peaked under the leadership of CEO Tim Cook,\" Colin Gillis of BGC Financial L.P. said in a note this week. \"Our view that that there is risk that the upgrade rate for the next iPhone may slow even more than the upgrade rate cycle of 6s, which has been materially lower than the upgrade rate of the iPhone 6 as per the company.\" However, others disagree and say that while things haven\\'t been great as of late, things will get better next year. \"Amid pervasive investor fear and negativity, we see results/guidance as not great but good enough to start swinging the tide from near-term fear to cautious optimism about the future,\" Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company LLC said in a note. \"Given our installed base work, we see a \"super-cycle\" in \\'17 and iPhone 7 could even sell a little better than bearish expectations.\"\\xa0Even Gillis acknowledges that shares could see a move higher after earnings due to the low expectations. After that bounce, though, his pessimism continues. \"[W]hen we ask ourselves \\'Do we see Apple gaining or losing its next $100 billion of value,\\' the answer is losing.\"\\n\\n\\nSprint says to be cash-flow positive next year, shares soar:\\xa0Sprint Corp (S.N) reported better-than-expected first-quarter revenue as big discounts attracted more postpaid subscribers, and the No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier said it expected to be cash flow positive next fiscal year after breaking even this year.\\xa0The company\\'s shares surged more than 28 percent to $5.93 on Monday - their biggest intraday percentage gain ever - after it also said it had enough money to fund its business this year.\\xa0Some analysts and investors had raised questions about Sprint\\'s financial position after majority owner SoftBank Corp (9984.T) agreed earlier this month to buy UK chipmaker ARM Holdings for $32 billion.\\xa0Sprint had negative cash flow of $3.17 billion in the financial year ended March 31.\\xa0\"We expect that we will have adequate sources to provide all the capital necessary to fund the business and repay the debt maturities due in FY 16,\" Chief Financial Officer Tarek Robbiati said on a conference call with analysts.Sprint, in which Japan\\'s SoftBank holds a more than 80 percent stake, said its net operating revenue fell marginally to $8.01 billion. Up to Friday\\'s close, Sprint\\'s shares had risen 27.6 percent since the start of the year.\\n\\n\\nInvestors realize Nintendo didn’t develop Pokémon Go and shares plummet:\\xa0Nintendo’s shares plunged after the company said late Friday that the worldwide success of Pokémon Go will not significantly impact its financial results. Nothing Nintendo disclosed about the ownership of the game was new information, but markets were shocked anyway.\\xa0The stock sank 18 percent to 23,220 yen at the close in Tokyo, the maximum one-day move allowed by the exchange, noted Bloomberg. After the drop, Nintendo’s stock remained flat. In morning trading today, the Kyoto-based company’s shares were down $2.36, or 8.14 percent, at $26.64.On Friday, Nintendo put out a statement pointing out that it owns only 32 percent of the voting power of The Pokémon Company, an affiliated company that holds the ownership rights to Pokémon. Nintendo also owns 13 percent of Niantic, the San Francisco-based mobile developer spun out of Google last year who developed and distributed the game.\\xa0“Because of this accounting scheme, the income reflected on the company’s consolidated business results is limited,” Nintendo wrote in a notice.\\xa0Also, Nintendo said that “Pokémon Go Plus,” its peripheral device for use with the application, is scheduled for release and it’s already reflected in the financial forecast.\\xa0Following Pokémon Go’s release in the U.S. at the beginning of July, Nintendo’s market valuation soared to more than\\xa0$40 billion, passing Sony.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVerizon to Pay $4.8 Billion for Yahoo’s Core Business:\\xa0the internet is an unforgiving place for yesterday’s great idea, and on Sunday, Yahoo reached the end of the line as an independent company.\\xa0The board of the Silicon Valley company agreed to sell Yahoo’s core internet operations and land holdings to Verizon for $4.8 billion, according to people briefed on the matter, who were not authorized to speak about the deal before the planned announcement on Monday morning.\\xa0After the sale, Yahoo shareholders will be left with about $41 billion in investments in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, as well as Yahoo Japan and a small portfolio of patents.That’s a pittance compared with Yahoo’s peak value of more than $125 billion, reached in January 2000. Founded in 1994, Yahoo was one of the last independently operated pioneers of the web. Many of those groundbreaking companies, like the maker of the web browser Netscape, never made it to the end of the first dot-com boom.\\xa0But Yahoo, despite constant management turmoil, kept growing. Started as a directory of websites, the company was soon doing much more, offering searches, email, shopping and news. Those services, which were free to consumers, were supported by advertising displayed on its various pages.\\xa0For a long time, the model worked. It seemed like every company in America — and across much of the world — wanted to reach people using the new medium, and ad revenue poured in to Yahoo.In the end, the company was done in by Google and Facebook, two younger behemoths that figured out that survival was a continuous process of reinvention and staying ahead of the next big thing. Yahoo, which flirted with buying both companies in their infancy, watched its fortunes sink as users moved on to apps and social networks.\\xa0Verizon, one of the nation’s biggest telecommunications companies, plans to combine Yahoo’s operations with AOL, a longtime Yahoo competitor acquired by Verizon last year. The idea is to use Yahoo’s vast array of content and its advertising technology to offer more robust services to Verizon customers and advertisers.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nGoogle Races to Catch Up in Cloud Computing:\\xa0When it comes to cloud computing, Google is in a very unfamiliar position: seriously behind.\\xa0Google is chasing Amazon and Microsoft for control of the next generation of business technology, in enormous cloud-computing data centers. Cloud systems are cheap and flexible, and companies are quickly shifting their technologies for that environment. According to analysts at Gartner, the global cloud-computing business will be worth $67 billion by 2020, compared with $23 billion at the end of this year.For Google, a loss in cloud computing would be a rare misstep for a company that revolutionized media with its advertising business, and then made the world’s leading smartphone operating system.But it will be an uphill climb.\\xa0Amazon Web Services, which began its cloud product a decade ago, remains the leader. The company took in $2.6 billion, 9 percent of Amazon’s sales, in the first quarter of 2016. Profits from the service made up 56 percent of Amazon’s operating income. Those numbers may well be higher when Amazon reports its second-quarter earnings on Wednesday.\\xa0Microsoft styled itself a cloud company, too, and the company said last week that revenue from Azure, its cloud business, which was founded in 2010, rose 100 percent over the last year. Cloud technology also figures in crucial businesses like Office 365.\\xa0In contrast, Google Cloud Platform does not even figure in the earnings reports of Alphabet, Google’s parent company. That has to sting, since the company owns perhaps the largest network of computers on the planet, spending close to $10 billion a year to handle services like search, Gmail and YouTube.the company said it has used artificial intelligence to cut the power use in its data centers 15 percent, a huge decrease considering how efficient these data factories were already.\\xa0Power is probably the largest single cost for all three of the cloud companies. Google is almost certain to use its savings to reduce prices, much the way it won in search advertising by figuring out its competitors’ costs, then undercutting them.\\xa0That ability to find energy efficiency may be a powerful tool to sell to others over Google Compute.\\n\\n\\nApple Watch Sales Fall 55% in Second Quarter, IDC Report Says:\\xa0Apple Watch sales fell 55 percent in the second quarter of 2016, dragging the global market for such devices lower, as potential customers hold off for an update coming later this year, according to a report from market intelligence firm IDC.\\xa0Apple Inc. sold 1.6 million watches in the second quarter of this year, down from 3.6 million units a year earlier, IDC said. Global smartwatch sales fell 32 percent to 3.5 million units.\\xa0While Apple held on to its position as the industry leader, with 47 percent of the market, it was the only company in the top five to see a decline. Samsung Electronics Co. saw its market share more than double to 16 percent.“Consumers have held off on smartwatch purchases since early 2016 in anticipation of a hardware refresh, and improvements in WatchOS are not expected until later this year, effectively stalling existing Apple Watch sales,\" IDC analyst Jitesh Ubrani wrote in the report. “Apple still maintains a significant lead in the market and unfortunately a decline for Apple leads to a decline in the entire market.”\\n\\n\\nNintendo shares plunge, company says Pokemon GO\\'s earnings impact limited:\\xa0Shares of Nintendo Co (7974.T) tumbled as much as 18 percent early on Monday after the company said smash-hit mobile game Pokemon GO would have only a limited impact on its earnings.\\xa0Nintendo said after the market closed on Friday that it had already factored in anticipated revenues from its Pokemon GO Plus device - an accessory worn on the wrist to alert players of nearby monsters to catch - and that it had no plans to revise its annual earnings forecasts for now.\\xa0Nintendo said its affiliate Pokemon Co receives licensing and fees from the game\\'s developer, Niantic Inc, and that profits at Nintendo from those revenues would be limited.\\xa0The company, which owns 32 percent of Pokemon Co, is due to report first-quarter earnings on Wednesday.\\xa0The phenomenal success of Pokemon GO has triggered massive buying in Nintendo shares and even with Monday\\'s decline, the shares are still up some 60 percent compared with levels prior to the game\\'s July 6 launch in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStartup Deal Activity Keeps Falling Worldwide:\\xa0According to a new report from KPMG International and CB Insights, global deal activity for venture capital-backed startups continued a decline in the second quarter after hitting record levels one year ago. In fact, at the current rate, deal activity will just barely top 2013’s numbers.\\xa0\"Many of the high-profile tech [initial public offerings] from 2015 continue to trade well below their initial offering price, putting pressure on private company valuations,\" said Brian Hughes of KPMG. \"This, combined with economic concerns in China and Europe, has continued to put a damper on VC investment.\"\\xa0\"It\\'s a challenging time for VC investors,\" he concluded.The reason funding moved higher while deal activity dropped is that some larger startups such as those of Snapchat Inc., Didi Chuxing, and Uber Technologies Inc. all saw huge rounds, accounting for much of the funding. In fact, in North America, Uber and Snapchat accounted for more than $4.5 billion of the $17.1 billion in total investment.And while there might have been more billion dollar companies minted in the second quarter than in the first, there were yet again more \"down events\"—companies raising new money or being acquired at a lower valuation—than there were unicorns created. According to the report, seven startups reached the unicorn club in the past four months, but CB Insights’ downround tracker shows that 17 failed to live up to expectations and experienced down events over that time. Unicorn creation saw its most recent peak in the third quarter of last year, when 25 were birthed.\\n\\n\\nRoger Ailes created another big problem for Fox News — the average age of its audience is 68:\\xa0Roger Ailes, the closest thing in modern U.S. politics to a kingmaker, today stepped down as head of Fox News, the network he founded 20 years ago and turned into a potent political force.\\xa0James Murdoch and his brother Lachlan, both named by father Rupert to run parent company 21st Century Fox last year, pushed Ailes out on the heels of a sexual harassment suit that led to more allegations of sexual misconduct from female anchors. The brothers saw the situation as a way to remove a longstanding obstacle to their power within the company.\\xa0A lot of the news reports — most of the key details were first broken by New York Magazine’s Gabriel Sherman — centered on how the 76-year-old, a lifelong Republican, clashed with the two brothers politically, personally and as an executive. Ailes is known as a venal operator, specializing in deals with questionable reciprocity. His style was completely at odds with James, a data-driven technocrat, and Lachlan, the earnest Murdoch member.\\xa0Mostly true. A lesser-known but perhaps more important reason had to do with more practical issues — namely, the business of Fox News itself, according to sources.\\xa0The average age of Fox News viewers in primetime, the hours that draw the highest ad rates and so are the ones that matter, is 68 — a group that advertisers don’t pay to reach. In the world of cable news, marketers really only pay for viewers in the 25-54 age range. That means a good chunk of Fox News’ audience is worth little to nothing.\\xa0Fox News still mints money — it accounts for as much as 24 percent of the parent company’s yearly profit, or more than $1.5 billion — but a lot of that comes from licensing fees paid by distributors to carry the network, which are only negotiated every few years. Fox News still leads in total viewership and in primetime, but it can’t capitalize on a lot of that audience since advertisers don’t pay for a lot of these viewers.\\xa0That weighed on the future value of the network, as James saw it, according to one person familiar with the matter, and as much as Ailes’s style and politics were issues for both brothers, the more pressing concern was managing for the future of the network, this source said.\\n\\n\\nReddit is still in turmoil: Its been one year since Reddit revolted\\xa0When the company cracked down on revenge porn and subreddits containing offensive content last summer, the backlash was swift and ultimately led to the ouster of interim CEO Ellen Pao. Although Pao was seen as the driving force behind efforts to make Reddit respectable enough to appeal to advertisers, the company continued its clean-up after her departure, making diverse hires and keeping up with the anti-harassment policy instituted during Pao’s tenure. But Reddit, led by CEO Steve Huffman, seems to be struggling with its reform. Over the past six months, over a dozen senior Reddit employees — most of them women and people of color — have left the company. Reddit’s efforts to expand its media empire have also faltered. Reddit let go of at least two key members of its team earlier this week, several sources with knowledge of Reddit confirmed to TechCrunch. Among those who lost their jobs are Reddit’s vice president of marketing, Celestine Maddy and Reddit’s editorial director, Vickie Chang. Also this week, Reddit HR generalist Nicole-Jasmin Clark left the company, according to our sources and confirmed by her LinkedIn, as well as a handful of people from the marketing team. The layoffs follow departures from the network’s video team last month, and the slow trickle of employees exiting the company over the past several months. Back in May, Reddit lost its head of community, Kristine Fasnacht, after being in the role for just nine months. In short, female and POC employees have been quietly leaving the company — by way of layoffs and resignations — from many departments, including engineering, marketing, operations and product. Reddit’s associate creative director Stephen Greenwood also left the company in June. sources say Reddit’s internal turmoil can be traced back to the company’s ongoing struggle to leave its antagonistic culture behind. Several employees fended off uncomfortable comments from users and management alike, sources claimed. “Management is terrible, a complete reflection of what the site is like,” one source said. Another source, a former Reddit employee who asked to remain anonymous described a management team with good intentions but poor execution.One individual speculated that the reemergence of the company’s drinking culture was to blame for the uncomfortable environment. Under Pao’s reign, Reddit tried to eradicate the bro-like amount of alcohol consumption at the office, but that went right out the window following Pao’s departure in July 2015.\\n\\n\\n\\nVisa and PayPal have finally settled a long-standing feud:\\xa0Two months ago, Visa’s CEO issued a thinly veiled threat to PayPal: Stop driving business away from us or risk increased competition like you’ve never seen.\\xa0He got his wish.\\xa0The two payment companies just announced a wide-ranging partnership that includes a promise from PayPal to stop steering Visa cardholders away from using their Visa cards for PayPal transactions.\\xa0The new accord will also enable PayPal’s mobile app to work as a payment option in brick-and-mortar stores whose equipment accepts tap-and-pay Visa payments.\\xa0The partnership appears to bring to a close tension between one of the world’s biggest credit companies and the biggest alternative online payment option in the U.S. PayPal has been viewed warily by the credit card companies that don’t appreciate PayPal pushing their customers to pay with a bank account hookup — known as ACH — rather than a payment card.\\xa0PayPal historically makes more money on a transaction when a user funds his or her PayPal wallet with a direct bank account hookup, since that method carries lower transaction fees than payment cards do.“The agreement affords PayPal certain economic incentives, including Visa incentives for increased volume, and greater long-term Visa fee certainty,” according to the press release.\\xa0Translation: Visa is paying PayPal for increasing the amount of PayPal transactions that flow through Visa pipes. It appears PayPal is also getting a promise that Visa will not raise the fees it charges PayPal when a PayPal customer uses a Visa card to make a PayPal purchase.\\xa0But it still appears likely that the deal will eat into PayPal’s profits as more Visa customers choose to pay with cards through PayPal instead of bank accounts, according to Craig Maurer, an analyst with Autonomous Research.\\xa0“Yes, PayPal will get some form of incentives from Visa, but we believe the off-set will be minimal while this drag will be material,” he wrote in research note to clients.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDollar Shave Club hit the jackpot when Unilever agreed to buy the online men\\'s razor merchant for $1 billion.\\xa0Other e-commerce startups such as Birchbox and Stitch Fix can\\'t necessarily expect their own suitor to sweep in with such sweet deals. That\\'s because the key to Dollar Shave Club\\'s appeal is not so much its online prowess but the fact that it built a powerful brand in four years. \\xa0Dollar Shave Club upended the industry\\'s traditional business model by offering a subscription service that sells blades for as little as $3 a month (including shipping and handling). The day Dollar Shave Club started selling subscriptions in March 2012, the company released a YouTube video starring founder Michael Dubin. He tells viewers the product is f***ing great, \"so gentle a toddler could use it.\" The website crashed, but the blades sold out in six hours. The video has been viewed about 23 million times. The company reached $150 million-plus in sales in 2015, Unilever said in a press release announcing the deal. That despite the fact that the blades lack many of Gillette\\'s high-tech enhancements. Few other e-commerce startups can claim to have built a brand so quickly. Unilever and P&G are masters at traditional marketing, mostly offline, but they struggle with the direct-to-consumer brand-building at which upstarts like Dollar Shave Club excel.\\n\\n\\nIntel\\'s slowing data center growth overshadows strong profit:\\xa0Intel on Wednesday reported slower revenue growth at its data center business, which makes semiconductors used in high-end servers, overshadowing a better-than-expected quarterly profit.\\xa0Shares of the world\\'s largest chipmaker fell 3 percent in after-hours trading.\\xa0Hurt by weak demand from enterprises, revenue at the highly-profitable unit rose 5 percent to $4 billion, but lagged the previous quarter\\'s 9 percent increase and remained below Intel\\'s annual target of low double-digit growth.Net revenue rose 2.6 percent to $13.53 billion, narrowly missing the average analyst estimate of $13.54 billion.Intel reported a better-than-expected profit as its cost-cutting begin to pay off. In April it announced plans to slash 12,000 jobs, or 11 percent of its global workforce, of which it said about half was already complete.\\xa0Intel\\'s forecast for $14.9 billion in current-quarter revenue topped the average analyst expectation of $14.63 billion.\\xa0Net income fell to $1.33 billion, or 27 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $2.71 billion, or 55 cents per share, a year earlier\\n\\n\\nUber Investors Said to Push for Didi Truce in Costly China Fight:\\xa0Uber Technologies Inc. investors have a message for management: It’s time to wrap up the costly fight in China. Several institutional investors are pushing the ride-hailing company to ink a partnership agreement with China’s market leader Didi Chuxing, according to people familiar with the matter, stemming the billions of dollars Uber is spending to expand in the region.Uber and Didi are bleeding cash in China as they fight for dominance in the world’s most populous country. Uber has said that it is spending at least $1 billion a year to expand its business in the country. Both are giving out incentives for drivers and free rides to compete for market share.Benchmark’s Bill Gurley -- an Uber investor and board member -- spoke briefly with Didi President Jean Liu at the Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, a few months ago, according to a person familiar with the matter. Didi is in the lead on its home turf, with 14 million drivers signed up in 400 Chinese cities. Uber has set a target of operating in 100 cities this year.\\xa0Uber set up a separate corporate entity to insulate its Chinese business, which has gathered local Chinese investors. Still, the parent company has also invested its own money, keeping the units financially intertwined. Among private technology companies, the rivals are giants. Uber, which was last valued at nearly $68 billion, says it has access to more than $11 billion in cash and equity. Didi, which was last valued at $28 billion, says it has more than $10 billion at its disposal in cash and equity.\\n\\n\\nStrong demand from China buoys Qualcomm forecast:\\xa0Qualcomm Inc forecast current-quarter profit largely above market estimates as it sees strong demand for its mobile chips in China and expects to sign more licensing deals.\\xa0Shares of the company, which also posted a better-than-expected third-quarter profit, rose about 7 percent in extended trading on Wednesday.The company, whose chips are used in Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd smartphones, is focusing on its flagship mobile processors to regain the market share.\\xa0Qualcomm expects to launch Snapdragon 821, an advanced and a faster version of Snapdragon 820, which powers Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge smartphones.\"I think it is pretty straightforward...Samsung is back as their customer and...more people in China are ready to pay to license their technology...so it looks like the company is well positioned for the coming quarters,\" said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy.Revenue rose to $6.04 billion quarter ended June 26 from $5.83 billion a year earlier.\\xa0Net Income attributable to Qualcomm rose to $1.44 billion, or 97 cents per share, from $1.18 billion, or 73 cents per share.\\n\\n\\nEBay beats revenue estimate, bumps up forecasts:\\xa0Online retailer eBay Inc reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and raised its sales forecast for the year as efforts to revamp its online marketplace start to pay off.\\xa0EBay shares were up 8 percent after the bell on Wednesday after the company\\'s board also authorized an additional $2.5 billion stock buyback program.\\xa0The company, which spun off PayPal last July, has tackled slowing growth by focusing on small business sellers, while offering a bigger selection of products.\\xa0Gross merchandise volume, or the total value of all goods sold on its sites, was up 4 percent at $20.9 billion in the second quarter ended June 30, helped by strength in its U.S. business.\\xa0The number of active buyers rose 4 percent to 164 million.\\xa0The company\\'s revenue also got a boost from robust sales at Stubhub, which won a 6.5 year revenue-sharing deal to resell tickets for the New York Yankees last month.The company\\'s net income rose to $435 million, or 38 cents per share, in the latest quarter from $83 million, or 7 cents per share, a year earlier.\\xa0Revenue rose 5.7 percent to $2.23 billion, ahead of analysts\\' average estimate of $2.17 billion.\\xa0Up to Wednesday\\'s close, shares of the San Jose, California-based company had fallen 5.6 percent in the past 12 months.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft Earnings Are Up, Cushioned by Its Cloud Business:\\xa0On Tuesday, in its quarterly earnings results, Microsoft offered strong signs that its cloud business was growing quickly. Revenue from Azure, a business Microsoft started to compete in cloud computing with Amazon, the market leader, rose more than 100 percent in the quarter.\\xa0Revenue from Office 365, a subscription version of the old Office software, rose 54 percent from commercial customers and 19 percent from consumers.Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, has made cloud computing a priority for the company since becoming chief executive two years ago. Many believed it was a move that Microsoft had long needed to make but was held back by the reluctance of its previous boss, Steven A. Ballmer.\\xa0There is risk in this transition. The profit margins from renting software in the cloud are not as high as selling a license to customers, and Microsoft investors have always counted on the company to generate exceptional profits. But the cloud business model tends to be more stable — a trade-off for slimmer margins.\\xa0After Microsoft’s misadventures in the smartphone market, it is a necessary trade-off. Last week, the company said it would fail to meet a goal of getting its Windows 10 operating system running on one billion devices before June 2018, largely because of its retrenchment in the mobile phone business.Now the company has laid off most of the thousands of people who joined Microsoft through the deal, written off the value of nearly all of the acquisition and whittled back the number of smartphones it sells. On Tuesday, Microsoft said that its phone revenue had declined 71 percent from a year ago.\\xa0For years, people have put off purchases of new machines or avoided them entirely in favor of smartphones and tablets. Last week, IDC, the technology research firm, said worldwide PC shipments fell 4.5 percent in the most recent quarter compared with a year earlier.For the quarter ended June 30, Microsoft reported net income of $3.12 billion, or 39 cents a share, compared with a loss of $3.2 billion, or 40 cents a share, during the same period a year earlier. Revenue fell to $20.61 billion, from $22.18 billion a year ago. The decline was partly the result of a $2 billion deferral of revenue related to Windows 10, its latest operating system. Accounting rules require Microsoft to recognize revenue from the software to be recognized in pieces over time.\\xa0Without the deferral, Microsoft’s revenue rose 2 percent from a year earlier to $22.64 billion.\\xa0The company’s shares jumped about 4 percent in after-hours trading following the release of its results.\\n\\n\\nGoogle has found a business model for its most advanced artificial intelligence:\\xa0Two years ago, Google spent over half a billion dollars for the tiny artificial intelligence startup DeepMind. Since then, the unit has walloped Atari video games and beaten an impossible board game.\\xa0Impressive stuff, that. But those AI demonstrations have yet to spell actual revenue. Until now — although the efforts are helping Google save money on its most expensive part.\\xa0DeepMind chief Demis Hassabis told Bloomberg that his unit recently began applying its advanced AI to Google’s data centers, finding ways to reduce the company’s sizable energy bill.\\xa0Google started using machine learning for its data centers two years ago, searching for ways to reduce costs for one of the company’s top expenses. A month ago, it aimed the more specialized AI tools from DeepMind at the problem of cooling these server farms. That cut the energy needed for cooling by 40 percent, the company said.\\xa0It didn’t offer a dollar figure for that, but it’s safe to assume that it means hundreds of millions in savings over the long haul.DeepMind technically sits outside of Google in Alphabet. (I’ve heard people describe it as in the “Alphaverse,” whatever that means.) But a rep said that Google was not paying DeepMind for its cost-cutting research here.\\n\\n\\nFacebook Pilots Offline Video for India in Duel With YouTube:\\xa0Facebook Inc. is piloting a feature in India allowing users to save videos to watch offline, chasing a similar program from Google’s YouTube, as the companies attempt to crack a market ridden with poor internet connectivity.\\xa0The move followed feedback from users in the country citing poor video experiences because of limited mobile coverage, Facebook said in a statement.\\xa0“We’re testing an option for people to download videos to Facebook while they’re online on good internet connections, to view the video at anytime, online or offline, without using extra mobile data,” the company said.\\xa0YouTube introduced offline video in 2014 to cater to Indians crazy about watching Bollywood song sequences, cricket snippets and comedy sketches. Despite the cost of downloads, an estimated 40 percent of data consumption on phone networks is video, said Nikhil Pahwa, editor of the New Delhi-based Medianama.com, which monitors news on the digital industry.Facebook, which has 142 million users in India, said the new feature helps users get through the lag between downloading and playing a video by saving it for later, similar to the YouTube feature.\\xa0Only original videos posted on personal Facebook accounts and on the social network’s pages can be downloaded. The program is being tested on a small percentage of Indian users, the company said without providing details on broader rollout.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNetflix Disappoints Wall Street as Subscriber Growth Slows:\\xa0Netflix isn’t looking so invincible anymore.\\xa0On Monday, the company disappointed Wall Street with the news that subscriber growth for its streaming video service had slowed significantly during the second quarter. Also disconcerting was that Netflix added far fewer subscribers over all during the period than expected, which the company blamed on news media coverage of its plans for price increases.\\xa0Netflix added just 1.7 million new streaming members in the three months that ended June 30, about half the 3.3 million net additions from the same period the previous year. That anemic growth — for both United States and international subscribers — came in well below its forecast of 2.5 million new members.\\xa0The development sent Netflix shares down as much as 16 percent in after-hours trading on Monday, representing the second earnings report in a row that has sparked a double-digit plunge in the company’s stock price. Mr. Hastings finds himself in a starkly different position from just six months ago, when he stood onstage at the big consumer electronics show in Las Vegas and declared that Netflix would conquer the global market for streaming television, adding more than 130 countries to its world service map.\\xa0At the time, the company’s share had been soaring, surging 135 percent in 2015 as the top performer on the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index.\\xa0So far this year, Netflix’s share price has declined about 14 percent. Still, some analysts pointed to the company’s financials as proof that it would continue to deliver on its plans in the long term. Net income for the quarter was $41 million, up 58 percent from $26 million during the same period last year. Total revenue was $2.1 billion, up 27 percent from $1.6 billion in the same period last year.\\n\\n\\nYahoo Revenue Falls 15 Percent and Profit Drops 64 Percent:\\xa0As Yahoo accepted the final bids for its core business on Monday, the internet company revealed just how badly that business was deteriorating.\\xa0Yahoo said that its revenue in the second quarter fell 15 percent, after excluding accounting adjustments, and its operating profit fell 64 percent.\\xa0Yahoo also acknowledged that Tumblr — its biggest acquisition under its current chief executive, Marissa Mayer — was now worth only one-third of the $1.1 billion that Yahoo paid for it in 2013.\\xa0But investors were not focused on the quarterly numbers or Yahoo’s vast overpayment for Tumblr. They were far more interested in whether Yahoo’s web, email, news and other businesses will finally be sold — and at what price.Yahoo has been conducting a prolonged auction for those assets since February, and final bids were due on Monday. Yahoo’s board is expected to evaluate the offers over the next week or two and decide whether to proceed with a transaction that would end Yahoo’s 20-year run as an independent, publicly traded company.Analysts expect the final bids to come in at $3.5 billion to $6 billion, including Yahoo’s land and patents.The write-off of most of the value of the Tumblr blogging network is emblematic of the failure of Ms. Mayer’s strategy to expand Yahoo by luring the mobile young users who drive the business of its chief rivals, Google and Facebook.In the second quarter, Yahoo’s revenue was $1.31 billion, up from $1.24 billion in the same quarter a year ago. But the most recent quarter’s revenue rose only because of a change in how Yahoo accounts for revenue from its search partnership with Microsoft. Excluding those changes, revenue fell 15 percent, and both search ads and display ads posted significant drops.\\xa0The company reported a net loss of $440 million, or 46 cents a share, for the quarter, compared with a loss $22 million, or 2 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago. Excluding the Tumblr write-off and other adjustments, the company’s operating profit fell 64 percent.\\xa0Shares of Yahoo were down slightly in after-hours trading Monday evening.\\n\\n\\nIBM Rises After Sales Beat Estimates on Software Unit Gains:\\xa0IBM second-quarter revenue beat analysts’ estimates, boosted by the unit that includes its Watson artificial intelligence platform, in an early indication that the company’s transition to cloud-based software and services is beginning to pay off.\\xa0Sales were $20.2 billion, compared with the average analyst estimate of $20.1 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\\xa0Revenue in cognitive solutions, which includes Watson, increased 3.5 percent to $4.7 billion. This is the first time since IBM reorganized its segments that the cognitive solutions portion has registered growth, after declining the previous five quarters in a row. Adjusted earnings, excluding some items, was $2.95 a share, beating the $2.89 average estimate of 19 analysts.\\xa0The shares rose 3.2 percent in late trading to $165. They are up 16 percent this year through the end of Monday, compared with a 6 percent gain on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.\\n\\n\\nWhat is ARM and why is SoftBank spending $32 billion on it?\\xa0SoftBank’s $32 billion deal to buy chip designer ARM had many people scratching their heads Monday.\\xa0It’s not that ARM isn’t important in tech. Indeed, its processor designs are used by nearly every chipmaker and, by extension, find a place inside nearly every piece of tech from cellphones to hard drives to networking gear.\\xa0Rather, it is the fact that the chipmaker is so far removed from SoftBank’s other businesses. The Japanese conglomerate has a wide range of tech holdings, including a controlling interest in Sprint, its own mobile carrier business in Japan and investments in Alibaba, OlaCabs and Snapdeal.\\xa0“SoftBank would have been one of the least likely I thought to buy ARM,” said longtime chip analyst Kevin Krewell of Tirias Research. “They are not in the semiconductor business in any significant way.”\\xa0Krewell says he suspects that SoftBank looked hard at buying other companies in the chip business and decided that ARM was the strongest play, especially for the very long term.It’s worth taking a second to understand how ARM’s business works and what it does.\\xa0ARM doesn’t make any products. Not only does it not manufacture chips, it doesn’t even design the ones that are eventually sold.\\xa0Rather, it designs the core engines that get built into others’ chips — chips from companies like Qualcomm and Nvidia as well as processors like Apple’s A9 and Samsung’s Exynos.\\xa0For its efforts, ARM gets a small license fee from every chip that uses its design. Because it is in so many products, that small license fee adds up to a pretty healthy business. Its 2015 revenue was nearly one billion British pounds.\\xa0And its sphere of influence is growing, both in terms of the number of chips using its design as well as the kinds of products. Last year nearly 15 billion chips using its designs were sold, up from about six billion in 2010.\\xa0Cars, servers and internet-of-things devices are all seen as big expansion areas for ARM chips.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSoftBank is bidding to buy ARM for $32 billion — because everything’s a computer now:\\xa0apan’s SoftBank is buying U.K.-based chip design firm ARM Holdings for about $32 billion, according to the FT.\\xa0Why? Everything is a computer now, and ARM has been one of the winners of the mobile revolution.\\xa0ARM designs chips — but doesn’t actually make them — for a huge variety of devices. It dominates the market for smartphones — Apple is a big client, as is Samsung — and its chips shows up in other consumer gadgets, as well as more-industrial-like devices and “internet of things” sensors.\\xa0The number of chips containing ARM processors reached almost 15 billion in 2015, up from about 6 billion in 2010.The move is a big one for SoftBank CEO Masa Son after his would-be successor, former Google executive Nikesh Arora, stepped away from the company last month. (Talks presumably started while Arora was still there.)\\xa0One key question is whether other firms will let SoftBank purchase ARM or if there will be a bidding war. Apple, arguably ARM’s most important client, and Intel, which lost the mobile chip war to ARM, are both potential buyers.\\n\\n\\n\\nATMs Spit Out Cash Without Cards as Smartphone Apps Take Over:\\xa0\\xa0Forgot your bank card at home? No worries. Many ATMs will soon dispense cash with help from a smartphone and banking app.\\xa0A growing number of banks are letting consumers arrange withdrawals via their mobile app and pick up the cash at a nearby automated teller machine. Customers authenticate the transaction by scanning a QR code with their phone, entering a one-time security code or tapping their device on the machine.\\xa0The idea is to help customers who have forgotten their cards or worry about thieves stealing their card data via ATMs. While so-called cardless cash access is only available at about 2,000 of the half a million or so U.S. ATMs in use today, it’s expanding rapidly and will be at as many as 95,000 machines by year end, according to payments researcher Crone Consulting LLC.\\xa0JPMorgan Chase & Co. plans to roll out the feature later this year. Bank of America Corp.said it will extend the technology to 5,000 ATMs by year end. And Wells Fargo & Co. is letting some users of mobile wallets like Apple Pay authenticate through their phone, and expects more than 40 percent of its ATMs to be enabled for this technology by year end.\\xa0In possibly the largest deployment to date, Payment Alliance International, the nation’s largest closely held provider of ATM processing and maintenance services, plans to announce Friday that it will start rolling out the technology in August or September, and plans to have cardless cash access at 25,000 machines in stores and gas stations by the end of 2017.The technology has cut transaction times at ATMs to about 10 seconds from 45 seconds, he said, adding that more than 8 percent of the bank’s mobile customers use the service.\\xa0Smartphone-based ATM transactions have also helped combat skimming, where criminals insert a device in an ATM that steals customers’ credentials and lets them make withdrawals later. Last year, the number of ATMs compromised by criminals in the U.S. jumped 546 percent, according to FICO Card Alert Service.\\xa0Upgrading an ATM with software for such smartphone-based withdrawals cost about $800, Ormseth said.\\n\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence Swarms Silicon Valley on Wings and Wheels:\\xa0For more than a decade, Silicon Valley’s technology investors and entrepreneurs obsessed over social media and mobile apps that helped people do things like find new friends, fetch a ride home or crowdsource a review of a product or a movie.\\xa0Now Silicon Valley has found its next shiny new thing. And it does not have a “Like” button.\\xa0The new era in Silicon Valley centers on artificial intelligenceand robots, a transformation that many believe will have a payoff on the scale of the personal computing industry or the commercial internet, two previous generations that spread computing globally. Computers have begun to speak, listen and see, as well as sprout legs, wings and wheels to move unfettered in the world.\\xa0The shift was evident in a Lowe’s home improvement store here this month, when a prototype inventory checker developed by Bossa Nova Robotics silently glided through the aisles using computer vision to automatically perform a task that humans have done manually for centuries.\\xa0The robot, which was skilled enough to autonomously move out of the way of shoppers and avoid unexpected obstacles in the aisles, alerted people to its presence with soft birdsong chirps. Gliding down the middle of an aisle at a leisurely pace, it can recognize bar codes on shelves, and it uses a laser to detect which items are out of stock.\\n\\n\\nSuccess of Pokemon GO adds impetus for change at Nintendo:\\xa0The phenomenal success of Pokemon GO and the surge in Nintendo Co\\'s (7974.T) market value by $17 billion in just over a week has been seized upon by one of its most vocal investors to press for a change of strategy at the company.\\xa0Until Pokemon GO, a mobile game, was launched just over a week ago, Nintendo had taken every opportunity to say its main focus was still gaming consoles, and games for smartphones were just a means to lure more people to them.\\xa0But the success of Pokemon GO - unforseen even by its creators - has shown the potential for augmented reality and for Nintendo to capitalize on a line-up of popular characters ranging from Zelda to Super Mario.\\xa0Seth Fischer, founder and chief investment officer at Oasis Management, is one of Asia\\'s best known hedge fund managers and has long been a small but loud shareholder. Encouraged by the success of mobile games like \"Candy Crush\", he has campaigned for years for the Japanese console maker to develop and sell games for platforms run by Apple and Google.\\xa0\"I hope they will now understand the power of smartphones,\" Fischer told Reuters. \"And as a result, I hope this means there is a whole change in strategy.\"\\xa0\"My next focus with Nintendo is for them to focus on monetizing the rest of their 4,000 patents for mobile gaming, multi-player gaming, et cetera. I think they could be making 30 to 60 billion yen ($290 million to $570 million) annually from licensing.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

But experts say Line is an unusual case of an established company with operating heft and a proven way to gin up sales — something that many new tech companies lack.\\xa0Line itself still faces considerable hurdles, such as slowing user growth and an untested plan to use advertising to help make it profitable.\\xa0Line’s American depositary shares, priced at $32.84 each on Monday, jumped to $42.70 in early trading in New York on Thursday. The stock is expected to begin trading in Japan on Friday.\\xa0Line’s debut coincided with another new high for the equity markets in the United States. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index has surged 8 percent since June 27, after Britain’s decision to leave the European Union roiled stocks worldwide, as investors anticipated additional stimulus from central banks.\\n\\n\\nSnapchat Geofilter Campaigns May Get a Boost From Yext:\\xa0Snapchat Inc. may start to see more brands paying up for location-based advertising campaigns on its photo-sharing mobile app, thanks to the efforts of another startup, Yext Inc.\\xa0Advertisers can already pay the social-media service to have branded geofilters -- a type of graphical overlay people can use to decorate photos or videos they’re sharing -- to show up in the app in specific locations. To run these campaigns, companies have had to manually provide Snapchat with the exact geographical details of where they want the filters to appear and the dimensions of each space. Yext, whose software helps businesses manage digital location data, has been working with Snapchat to make that process easier. The New York-based startup on Thursday is unveiling a new feature that lets clients give Snapchat all that information with a few taps.Last year, Snapchat started offering geofilters to brands as an advertising platform. In the U.S., a national geofilter campaign reaches 40 percent to 60 percent of daily users, according to Snapchat’s website. The company also unveiled a cheaper option for smaller businesses and individuals this year: on-demand geofilters. The starting price for one of these geofilters is $5 for up to 20,000 square feet of coverage. Companies including McDonald’s Corp., Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. and Yum! Brands subsidiary KFC have already launched location-based ad campaigns on Snapchat. The fried chicken seller offered special KFC-themed geofilters at more than 900 locations in the U.K., resulting in a more than 23 percent lift in visitation within a week of a user seeing the filter in a friend’s Snap, according to a June presentation by KPCB partner Mary Meeker.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPokemon GO gets ads - could be next big marketing tool for retailers:\\xa0Pokemon GO, a mobile game that has rocketed to the top of Apple Inc and Android app stores in record time, looks set to challenge young internet companies which specialize in increasing foot traffic for small businesses and may end up playing a role in major brands\\' marketing, according to industry experts.\\xa0The augmented reality game from Japan\\'s Nintendo Co Ltd, where players walk around real-life neighborhoods to hunt down virtual cartoon characters on their smartphone screens, has more than 65 million users in the United States just seven days after launch.\\xa0That is more users than Twitter Inc, and the game is already helping local restaurants, coffee shops and small retailers to attract new customers.\\xa0L\\'inizio Pizza Bar in Long Island City in New York claims its sales jumped 75 percent over the weekend by activating a \"lure module\" feature that attracts virtual Pokemon characters to the store, thereby tempting in nearby players. The store\\'s manager spent $10 to have a dozen Pokemon characters placed in the location, according to a report in the New York Post.\\xa0That sort of instant effect is a potential threat for Groupon Inc, LivingSocial Inc, Foursquare and other relatively new companies which have revolutionized online marketing for small businesses in the last few years.\\n\\n\\nZendesk’s “Automatic Answers” taps machine learning, AI to generate bot-style email responses:\\xa0Chat bots have ballooned in popularity in recent months, and now we’re seeing some interesting examples of how that technology, where computers interact and respond to human requests, is being used to solve other problems. Today,Zendesk is taking the wraps off “Automatic Answers”, a service for businesses to reply to emails from customers without ever having a human employee get involved.\\xa0Automatic Answers is not your average, run-of-the mill email autoresponder. The service was built using a machine learning platform that Zendesk’s in-house teams of data scientists and engineers, which are based out of Melbourne, Australia, have been developing on for a while now.\\xa0That machine learning platform was first announced last year and it also powers a service Zendesk announced last October, Satisfaction Prediction, which is able to monitor customer-company interactions to — as its name implies — determine whether the customer is getting what she or he needs.\\xa0The machine learning/AI element means that the responses in Automatic Answers are not only reading and responding specifically to what you the customer is asking, but it is technically getting smarter with each response (and presumably using a bit of Satisfaction Prediction to figure out if it’s getting it right).\\xa0Automatic Answers will work first in email because, as Zendesk’s VP of product Sam Boonin tells me, “Even in a world of customer services embedded in every communication channel from social to web to phone, email still represents the majority of interactions that are coming in.”\\n\\n\\nNo more Tesla buyback guarantee as company cuts price of Model X:\\xa0Tesla Motors Inc has ended a program that guaranteed the resale value of its cars, and lowered the starting price of its Model X crossover, the high-profile electric vehicle maker said on Wednesday.\\xa0The discontinuation of the buyback program, as of July 1, allows Tesla to free up cash that had been set aside to buy back Model S cars after three years at a value of at least 50 percent of the base purchase price.\\xa0The changes come after Tesla warned earlier this month it will miss its vehicle delivery target for a second consecutive quarter.It faces other challenges, including a regulatory investigation of its Autopilot technology following a May 7 fatal crash and more scrutiny of its financials after a proposed merger with SolarCity Corp.\\xa0Within the next 12 months, Tesla has disclosed it could pay a maximum of $192.4 million to cover resale value guarantees on 4,209 vehicles. That amounts to a maximum liability of $45,711 per car, although Tesla could offset payouts by reselling repurchased vehicles.\\xa0Tesla valued the total liability created by the resale value guarantee at $1.58 billion as of March 31, according to its latest quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, up over 20 percent since the end of 2015.\\xa0The program, begun in 2013, was intended to help Tesla control its secondary market and reassure buyers purchasing vehicles using its novel technology that resale values wouldn\\'t drop substantially.\\xa0A Tesla spokesperson said the program was discontinued to \"keep interest rates as low as possible and offer a compelling lease and loan program to customers.\"\\xa0In effect, Tesla is now doing what most established auto makers do: allow market forces to set trade-in values.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEU-U.S. commercial data transfer pact enters into force:\\xa0A new commercial data pact between the European Union and the United States entered into force on Tuesday, ending months of uncertainty over cross-border data flows, and companies such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft can sign up from Aug. 1.\\xa0The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield will give businesses moving personal data across the Atlantic - from human resources information to people\\'s browsing histories to hotel bookings - an easy way to do so without falling foul of tough EU data transferral rules.\\xa0The previous such framework, Safe Harbour, was struck down by the EU\\'s top court in October on the grounds that it allowed U.S. agents too much access to Europeans\\' data.\\xa0Revelations three years ago from former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden of mass U.S. surveillance practices caused political outrage in Europe and stoked mistrust of big U.S. tech companies.\\xa0In the months that followed the EU ruling companies have had to rely on other more cumbersome mechanisms for legally transferring data to the United States.\\xa0The Privacy Shield will underpin over $250 billion dollars of transatlantic trade in digital services annually.\\xa0Google and Microsoft said they would sign up to the Privacy Shield and would work with European data protection authorities in case of inquiries.\\xa0A person familiar with social network Facebook\\'s thinking said the company had not yet decided whether to sign up.\\n\\n\\nGoogle just scored a bunch of new property to make its crazy dream campus come true:\\xa0Google couldn’t score LinkedIn’s business. But it’s getting LinkedIn’s real estate.\\xa0On Tuesday, the two companies announced a large, surprising property swap encompassing over three million square feet of existing and future real estate, including LinkedIn’s corporate headquarters. The companies wouldn’t share financial terms, but they said neither side paid a premium for the properties.\\xa0From Google, LinkedIn is picking up seven buildings, a plan it said will consolidate its staff around its Sunnyvale and Mountain View Calif., offices. The company said the deal is unrelated to its recent Microsoft acquisition.\\xa0In return, Google is getting LinkedIn’s Mountain View headquarters office and — far more critical for the internet giant — four different surrounding properties that enable Google to follow through on its ambitious plan for a new, green, crazy-futurist campus.\\xa0But here’s the kernel: Google proposed the aforementioned crazy-futurist campus in early 2015. It was a big deal; the “genius” architect behind it got a magazine cover. Then LinkedIn spoiled the fun: Mountain View’s city council voted last May to cede the property to LinkedIn, blocking Google’s grand vision.\\xa0But now the runway for Google is clear.\\n\\n\\nAmazon Says ‘Prime Day’ Sales Up 30 Percent for Merchants:\\xa0Amazon.com Inc. said Prime Day sales from third-party merchants surged 30 percent compared with a year earlier, fueled largely by international demand.\\xa0While U.S. sales appeared to start slowly on Tuesday, hampered by technical glitches, the world’s largest e-commerce company built momentum on the summertime promotion it created last year to entice shoppers to subscribe to its $99-a-year Amazon Prime membership.\\xa0“Led by strong growth internationally, we are seeing more than 30 percent increase over last year in the number of items sold by small businesses and sellers on Prime Day,” Amazon said in an e-mail, reflecting sales as of 3 p.m. New York time. “We are expecting a record day for small businesses and sellers on Amazon with many more deals to come today.” Amazon also used Prime Day to push shoppers beyond physical goods by offering discounts on housecleaning through Amazon Home Services, restaurant delivery in several cities and on-demand video rentals for movies such as “Kung Fu Panda 3” and “Deadpool.” Hot-selling items on Tuesday included pressure cookers and iRobot Roomba vacuums, according to the company.The event highlights the benefits of Prime membership, such as free two-day shipping on many items, which converts the occasional Amazon shopper into a devotee. Prime subscribers spend about $1,200 annually on the website, compared with $500 for non-subscribers, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners in Chicago. Amazon had 63 million Prime subscribers as of June 30, an increase of 43 percent from a year earlier, according to the research firm.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe non-gamer’s guide to playing Pokemon Go:\\xa0Pokemon Go is a full-blown phenomenon, with millions of downloads and excitement only growing after players got through their first weekend of being real-life Pokemon trainers. The game is heavy on fun but light on explanations -- particularly if you\\'re so excited to start playing that you blitz through the opening tutorial.\\xa0So maybe you\\'ve downloaded it, fired it up and then gotten, well, completely lost. If you\\'re completely mystified by how this game actually works, here are some basics to get you out there and catching Pokemon in no time.Once you download the app, you\\'ll be asked to sign in. You can sign in using an existing Google account. Or, if you\\'re not so keen to connect your Pokemon identity to your Google identity, then you can also sign up with the Pokemon Trainer Club, which is an account with the Pokemon Co. From there, you design your character and pick your first Pokemon. Then you can get going!\\xa0And you will have to actually get going. The whole selling point of the game is to walk around the real world to find the cute little critters. This not only encourages you to explore your own city, but also -- gasp! -- gets you outside and around other people. In fact, this is not really a game you can play while stationary. Sometimes Pokemon will come to you, but more often than not you have to go to them.\\n\\n\\nTwitter Falls After Analysts Downgrade Stock on Slow Growth View:\\xa0Twitter Inc. slipped after analysts at two firms downgraded the stock, citing a lack of confidence in the company’s direction and ability to capitalize on new products.\\xa0\"What is Twitter? Quite frankly, we don’t believe that question has been answered,\" said James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. in a note. \"Barring any changes, Twitter was, is and will continue as a niche product.\" He downgraded the stock to the equivalent of hold from buy.\\xa0Robert Peck, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey also lowered his rating on the stock to the equivalent of hold from buy. “User growth and engagement for Twitter continue to be challenged, and we believe that increasing monetization can only go so far with limited new product introductions increasing competition (Snapchat!) and a challenging advertising background,” Peck said in a note.The stock fell 2.6 percent to $17.61 at 10:16 a.m. in New York. The shares have declined about 50 percent over the past year, valuing the company at about $12.4 billion. Many analysts see the company as an inevitable takeover target some day, though not anytime soon.\\xa0“It’s surely an upside risk to our new rating, but at this time we expect Twitter will have to navigate as a standalone company,” Cakmak said.\\n\\n\\nThe SEC is investigating whether Tesla should have told its investors about a fatal crash:\\xa0The Securities Exchange Commission is opening an investigation into Tesla to determine whether the company should have told shareholders earlier about a fatal crash related to its autonomous driving tech, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.\\xa0Joshua Brown was killed on May 7 when his Tesla, operating in Autopilot mode, drove into a tractor-trailer that that was crossing the highway. Autopilot is a semi-autonomous driving technology that’s a much more sophisticated version of cruise control.\\xa0Weeks later, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into the accident to determine whether the technology worked as expected.\\xa0This SEC probe, on the other hand, is not about the technology; it’s about whether, under securities law, Tesla should have told its investors about the accident and when. A Tesla spokesperson said the company had not received any communication from the SEC as yet.)\\xa0The results of the SEC probe will set a precedent for the auto industry as more automakers roll out their own versions of Autopilot. The 2017 Mercedes Benz E class will be equipped with semi-autonomous technology called Drive Pilot; Volvo’s XC90 already has semi-autonomous technology called Pilot Assist; and General Motor’s Super Cruise technology is expected to become available in the 2017 Cadillac CT6.\\xa0Automakers typically don’t disclose to investors every single accident in which their vehicles are involved. If, however, the SEC determines that Tesla should have disclosed this accident to its investors, that may all change.\\n\\n\\nBezos Beats Buffett as Amazon Market Value Tops Berkshire:\\xa0Amazon.com Inc., Jeff Bezos’s online retailer, moved past Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to become one of the world’s five largest companies by market value on Monday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Amazon rose as high as $356.5 billion in the first two hours of trading. The company surpassed Berkshire on the day before Prime Day, an annual promotion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is Pokémon Go and why is everybody talking about it?:\\xa0This new Pokémon game is bringing augmented reality mainstream.It’s a new mobile game, free on both iOS and Android, that lets you create an avatar that can catch, train, trade and battle Pokémon characters inside the game. That sounds familiar. Isn’t that the premise of virtually every other Pokémon game?\\xa0Yes, kinda. What makes this game unique is that it uses your phone’s location services and camera so that you can catch Pokémon in real life. That is, when you walk around the streets of whatever city or town you live in, your avatar moves inside the game. So finding new Pokémon and checkpoints for the game actually requires you to get off the couch and walk down the block.\\xa0How does this work?\\xa0The game uses Google Maps technology to place your avatar on a virtual world that mirrors your real life surroundings. When you find a Pokémon, the game uses augmented reality (AR) to make it look like whatever Pokémon you’ve stumbled across is indeed standing right there in front of you. Who created Pokémon Go?\\xa0Nintendo and the other creators of Pokémon teamed up with Niantic Labs to create the game. The former company was born inside Google; its founder, John Hanke, was a key leader of its Geo products (Google Maps, Earth). After moving to leave Google in 2010, Hanke was lured to stay with funding for Niantic, a skunkworks project to build mobile AR tools using Google Maps technology. Niantic’s first effort, Ingress — an augmented-reality, massively multiplayer, location-based online game — cultivated a small but very dedicated following. Niantic spun out of Google in the fall, yet the search giant stayed involved, participating in a $30 million investment for developing Pokémon Go.\\n\\n\\nNintendo shares surge on Pokemon mobile game hopes:\\xa0Shares of Japan\\'s Nintendo Co soared more than 20 percent in early Tokyo trading on Monday, extending last week\\'s gains, on hopes that the popularity of its new Pokemon GO smartphone game will boost its results.\\xa0Pokemon GO was launched in the United States last week and shot to the No. 1 free app in Apple Inc\\'s U.S. iTunes store. It was also launched in Australia and New Zealand, and is expected to be rolled out in Japan soon.\\xa0Nintendo shares were up 23.5 percent at 20,085 yen ($199.32) each after earlier rising as high as 20,190 yen, their highest since November.\\n\\n\\nElizabeth Holmes of Theranos Is Barred From Running Lab for 2 Years:\\xa0Federal regulators have barred Elizabeth Holmes, chief executive of Theranos, from owning or operating a medical laboratory for at least two years, raising new questions about the future of the embattled blood-testing start-up and its founder, once a Silicon Valley phenomenon.\\xa0In a letter sent to Theranos that was made public on Friday, regulators said they were revoking the certification of its flagship laboratory in Newark, Calif., effective Sept. 5. They also said the laboratory would be prohibited from taking Medicare and Medicaid payments.\\xa0The government scrutiny stemmed from questions about the effectiveness of Theranos’s technology and the way the company operated its labs.\\xa0The company faces a fine of $10,000 for every day it is out of compliance with regulations, effective July 12.\\xa0Such stern sanctions are “virtually unheard-of in my 40 years’ experience in the industry,” said David Nichols, president of the Nichols Management Group, a consultant to and operator of clinical laboratories. “I don’t see a path forward for the company.”\\xa0What Theranos and Ms. Holmes will do next is not clear. The company said in its statement that it would continue to operate a laboratory it owns in Arizona, at least for now.\\xa0But if the license of the California lab is indeed revoked, then Ms. Holmes and Theranos could not own or operate any laboratory, and the Arizona facility would also have to be shut, according to both Theranos and a spokesman for the regulator.\\n\\n\\nJapan\\'s Line sets top price for up to $1.3 billion IPO:\\xa0Line Corp set the price for its initial public offering at the top of its marketing range, raising up to $1.3 billion, a regulatory filing showed on Monday, reflecting robust appetite for the Japanese messaging app firm.\\xa0The company set the IPO price at 3,300 yen per share, compared with its book-building range of 2,900-3,300 yen. It had initially set the range at 2,700-3,200 yen but bumped it up last week. Including an over-allotment arrangement, Line will sell up to 132.8 billion yen ($1.3 billion) of shares.\\xa0Line, owned by South Korea\\'s Naver Corp, plans to list in New York on July 14 and in Tokyo the following day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber Is Said to Close $1.15 Billion High-Yield Leveraged Loan:\\xa0Uber Technologies Inc. closed a $1.15 billion high-yield leveraged loan, a person familiar with the matter said, bringing the total equity and debt raised by the ride-hailing mobile app to more than $15 billion.\\xa0Bloomberg reported last month that Uber was seeking to raise $1 billion to $2 billion in debt. Morgan Stanley, Barclays Plc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. facilitated the deal. Creditors will receive about a 5 percent yield on the loan, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the terms aren’t public.\\n\\n\\nAmazon’s Audible Goes Long on Short-Form Audio:\\xa0Amazon hopes to persuade people to pay for something they have traditionally enjoyed free: short-form audio.\\xa0Audible, Amazon’s audiobook and spoken-word subsidiary, on Thursday announced Channels, a subscription service that will offer a new library of audio, including original programs, articles read aloud and more. At $4.95 a month, it presents a lower-priced entry point to the service and significantly expands on Audible’s core audiobook offering, while giving listeners more incentive to stick with the company.\\xa0Channels will be free under Audible’s traditional $14.95 monthly membership, which provides access to hundreds of thousands of programs and audiobooks.Roughly two out of five Audible customers listen to podcasts, he said. But those customers are not always satisfied with what they find.\\xa0“When you talk to those customers and you ask them about podcasting, they describe something that equally enthralls them and frustrates them,” he said. In that frustration, Audible sees an opportunity.\\xa0Similar programs, in the form of podcasts — a label Audible resists as too narrow — have traditionally been free, supported by advertising, sponsorships, user donations or support from media and radio organizations. That a subsidiary of a company as aggressive as Amazon would invest in such a service suggests that it anticipates a willingness among the public to pay for short-form audio.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia\\'s $4 Smartphone Seems Too Good to Be True:\\xa0A little-known Indian company called Ringing Bells Pvt is set to start shipping the Freedom 251. The prototype touts a quad-core processor, a 4-inch screen and front and back cameras - at the astonishingly low price of 251 rupees (less than $4).\\xa0While global brands Samsung Electronics Co. and Lenovo Group Ltd. sell devices for less than $100, the $4 smartphone is the one stirring up the internet-hungry, app-crazy hordes in a country where Apple Inc. has been unable to make a dent. With iPhones costing upwards of $700, Apple commands a mere 2 percent market share in a country where the World Bank puts the per capita income at $5,630.\\xa0Brands can\\'t make money even on $50 smartphones, so profiting from a $4 device is a ludicrous idea, say experts like Tarun Pathak, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Technology Market Research. While Micromax sells millions of cheap devices every month in smaller cities - it profits by taking advantage of economies of scale. Ringing Bells’ managing director Mohit Goel isn\\'t counting on a profit from device sales, conceding that the company will lose hundreds of rupees on each unit, and is instead planning to recoup money through advertising and marketing deals. Goel has said the company is importing kits from Taiwan and assembling the phones in a factory in Haridwar near Delhi.Even at $4, the smartphone could still be out of reach for most because of scarcity. When Goel first announced Freedom 251 in February, the company said over 70 million jostled to register, crashing its website. Last week he said Ringing Bells will soon start shipping 200,000 smartphones to buyers picked by lottery. Other details were not available and e-mails, phone calls and text messages to Goel and his representatives in the past days went unanswered.\\xa0Selling such a cheap device has attracted scrutiny along with the publicity. The prototype Freedom 251 presented to the media turned out to be produced by another manufacturer with its logos covered. Thwarted buyers protested outside the company’s headquarters, setting off inquiries by the police and tax officials.\\xa0Pankaj Mahindroo, president of the Indian Cellular Association, with members including Apple and Samsung, said “We are concerned and keeping a close watch.”\\n\\n\\nAnother Tesla crash is under investigation to see if Autopilot is at fault:\\xa0U.S. transportation regulators are opening a new probe of a Tesla car crash, one week afterannouncing an investigation into a fatal crash of a Tesla operating in the company’s semi-autonomous driving mode.\\xa0The new investigation involves a non-fatal crash on July 1 in Pennsylvania. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will try to determine if the Tesla’s Autopilot functions were active at the time.\\xa0The additional investigation will likely intensify scrutiny around the safety and design of Tesla’s Autopilot product, which provides some self-driving features as a software update.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nZomato\\'s Results:\\xa0For the year ending March 2016, Zomato posted revenues of Rs 87.5 crore for the India region, up from Rs 46 crore revenues in 2015.

This is nearly half of Zomato\\'s overall net loss of Rs 574.5 crore in FY16.In the US market that accounts for nearly 50% of its listings, the Gurugram-based company posted a net loss of Rs 327.5 crore on revenues of Rs 6.73 crore for the fiscal. This is a massive increase from Rs 33 crore on revenues of Rs 5.1 crore in 2015. Zomato had forayed into United States last year with the $52 million UrbanSpoon acquisition that was eventually folded into the company.In terms of segments, Online advertising still dominates Zomato\\'s revenues, accounting for 91.4% of the company\\'s overall revenues. The segment\\'s revenues grew by 76.1% to Rs 169.1 crore for FY16, from Rs 96 crore in FY15.\\xa0Revenues from online ordering was at Rs 7.5 crore for the fiscal, accounting for nearly 4% of the company\\'s revenues. Goyal had recently said that 20% of its India revenues came from the ordering business in April this year.\\xa0Subscription revenues grew to Rs 8.4 crore from Rs 0.64 crore in 2015.

Such a move reflects new optimism about the company after the success of the Galaxy S7, with the shares rallying 17 percent this year.“Samsung’s smartphone business has finally had a soft landing after a bumpy ride,” said Chung Chang Won, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Seoul. Samsung will probably boost spending on memory and displays, which “are poised for a sudden rise as the next growth drivers.”But with growth in the global smartphone market evaporating, it needs to build up its other major businesses as competitors bring out new products in an attempt to spark growth.\\n\\n\\nTesla Falls After Paring Delivery Forecast Amid Factory Strains:\\xa0Tesla Motors Inc. fell after the electric-car maker missed second-quarter forecast for global deliveries and lowered its full-year outlook, citing an “extreme” increase in output in the period’s final month.\\xa0The shares slid 3.3 percent to $209.40 at 9:35 a.m. New York time.

About half of the quarter’s output in the final four weeks.The carmaker has had trouble getting its vehicles to customers fast enough to meet its targets even after increasing production. Tesla said 5,150 cars were still on trucks and ships making their way to clients who ordered them, and will be delivered in the first part of this quarter. Tesla is increasing output at its Fremont, California, factory with an eye toward making 500,000 cars a year by 2018 -- an ambitious timeline that also depends on the carmaker’s battery factory east of Reno, Nevada, coming online with battery-cell production.\\xa0Tesla missed its deliveries forecast for the second time in a row this year.

As of 6pm PST July 5th, over 4,000 messages of frustration have been posted in the company’s Bugs Community Forum.\\xa0After the Direct Checkout outage, many merchants were left with their hands in their laps explaining delays to buyers. The outage is especially tough for sellers who have to face angry customers. It’s all too easy for an unhappy buyer to blame the seller in a negative review for an outage out of their control.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow AWS came to be:\\xa0There are lots of stories about the formation of AWS, but this much we know: 10 years ago,Amazon Web Services, the cloud Infrastructure as a Service arm of Amazon.com, was launched with little fanfare as a side business for Amazon.com. Today, it’s a highly successful company in its own right, riding a remarkable $10 billion run rate. What you may not know is that the roots for the idea of AWS go back to the 2000 timeframe when Amazon was a far different company than it is today — simply an e-commerce company struggling with scale problems. Those issues forced the company to build some solid internal systems to deal with the hyper growth it was experiencing — and that laid the foundation for what would become AWS.\\xa0Speaking recently at an event in Washington, DC, AWS CEO Andy Jassy, who has been there from the beginning, explained how these core systems developed out of need over a three-year period beginning in 2000, and, before they knew it, without any real planning, they had the makings of a business that would become AWS. It began way back in the 2000 timeframe when the company wanted to launch an e-commerce service called Merchant.com to help third-party merchants like Target or Marks & Spencer build online shopping sites on top of Amazon’s e-commerce engine. It turned out to be a lot harder than they thought to build an external development platform, because, like many startups, when it launched in 1994, it didn’t really plan well for future requirements. Instead of an organized development environment, they had unknowingly created a jumbled mess. That made it a huge challenge to separate the various services to make a centralized development platform that would be useful for third parties.At that point, the company took its first step toward building the AWS business by untangling that mess into a set of well-documented APIs. While it drove the smoother development of Merchant.com, it also served the internal developer audience well, too, and it set the stage for a much more organized and disciplined way of developing tools internally going forward.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSalesforce Pushed Microsoft to Up LinkedIn Bid Before Deal:\\xa0Salesforce.com Inc. battled Microsoft Corp. for LinkedIn Corp. deep into the negotiating process, forcing the world’s largest software maker to boost its offer to buy the professional-networking service just days before the $26 billion deal was announced.\\xa0Three other companies were involved in the discussions, which lasted almost four months, according to a regulatory filing Friday. One of those was Facebook Inc., which passed on an acquisition, according to a person involved in the negotiations.\\xa0Microsoft increased its offer to $196 a share June 11, from $182 a share earlier, after the other main bidder offered \"approximately $200\" a share for the company, the filing said. The board ultimately decided the Microsoft offer was stronger in part because it was an all-cash deal, while the other bidder was offering to pay with its stock and cash, the filing said.There were other companies that expressed interest in acquiring LinkedIn, or were involved in the process. Those were referred to as Parties B, C and D in the filing. Recode reported Friday that Party B was Google, the internet search business of Alphabet Inc., and Party D was Facebook, operator of the largest social network.\\n\\n\\n\\nTesla crash raises concerns about autonomous vehicle regulation:\\xa0The fatal crash of a Tesla Motors Inc Model S in Autopilot mode has turned up pressure on auto industry executives and regulators to ensure that automated driving technology is deployed safely.\\xa0The first such known accident, which occurred in Florida in May, has highlighted tensions surrounding efforts to turn over responsibility for braking, steering and driving judgments to machines. It may delay the U.S. government\\'s plan to outline guidelines for self-driving cars this month.\\xa0The cause of the Model S crash is still under investigation by federal and Florida state authorities, which are looking into whether the driver was distracted before his 2015 Model S went under a truck trailer.\\xa0Shares of Tesla and Mobileye NV, the maker of the camera vision system used in the Model S, rose on Friday as analysts said the accident was likely a short-term setback. The stocks fell in after-hours trading on Thursday after an investigation of the crash was made known.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy Tech Support Is (Purposely) Unbearable:\\xa0“Don’t think companies haven’t studied how far they can take things in providing the minimal level of service,” Mr. Robbins said. “Some organizations have even monetized it by intentionally engineering it so you have to wait an hour at least to speak to someone in support, and while you are on hold, you’re hearing messages like, ‘If you’d like premium support, call this number and for a fee, we will get to you immediately.’”\\xa0The most egregious offenders are companies like cable and mobile service providers, which typically have little competition and whose customers are bound by contracts or would be considerably inconvenienced if they canceled their service. Not surprisingly, cable and mobile service providers are consistently ranked by consumers as providing the worst customer support.Of course, companies rated best for tech support often charge more for their products or they may charge a subscription fee for enhanced customer care so the cost of helping you is baked in, as with Apple’s customer support service, AppleCare, and theAmazon Prime subscription service.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZenefits halves its previous valuation to $2B to head off investor lawsuits:\\xa0Zenefits is executing a change in its current ownership structure that will increase the overall ownership of the company for late-stage investors; it’s a move that revalues the company’s Series C round at $2 billion and looks to placate investor concerns over the company’s regulatory investigations.\\xa0As part of accepting the new ownership changes, the investors participating will sign a release of claims against the company. It’s another move that new CEO David Sacks is doing in what’s been a massive cleanup effort of the company following report after report of the company skirting insurance regulation. Since all those regulatory issues came to light, the company has laid off more than 350 employees and parted ways with its former CEO Parker Conrad. The biggest issue stemmed from a program called “The Macro” that would aid in circumventing state licensing requirements.All this is basically a way to reset expectations for investors, as well as try to retain employees following the changes in the company’s ownership structure. Shareholders were kept in the dark in relation to the existence and use of “The Macro,” which required a reset of the relationship. Zenefits grew like a rocket ship, reaching a $4.5 billion valuation in just about two years after the company started. That, at the time, labeled the company as one of the fastest-growing SaaS startups ever — but, obviously, there was a bunch of shady stuff going on behind the scenes to pad that growth.\\n\\n\\nApple is in “exploratory talks” to acquire Tidal, the streaming music service run by Jay-Z, the Wall Street Journal reports. Recode has confirmed that the companies are discussing a deal.\\xa0The fact that Tidal, which has been shopping itself for some time, is now talking to a buyer with incredibly deep pockets — and a streaming service — is not a surprise.\\xa0One thing seems certain: This is a different situation from when Tim Cook, Eddy Cue and companypaid $3 billion for Beats two years ago. Then, it was acquiring several executives, including Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, plus the Beats Music team and a hardware business that was selling lots of expensive headphones.\\xa0Tidal, on the other hand, has much less to offer:\\xa0Tidal has about four million paying subscribers, according to the WSJ. (For context, Apple Music has 15 million.) Those can’t automatically be moved over to Apple Music, but Apple should be able to persuade many of them to come over.\\xa0It has whatever Jay-Z brings to the table for consumer marketing and artist relationships.\\xa0Perhaps most importantly, a deal would take Tidal off the market as a competitor for artist exclusives, which have created much of its buzz. This presumably means Apple wouldn’t have to worry about not being able to stream the new Beyoncé album, for example. (Though Tidal’s artist and label deals will likely expire upon acquisition, as is typical.)\\xa0Apple also probably doesn’t have much competition for this deal, so it would be in a strong position. Samsung, the most logical buyer, walked away from its earlier talks with Tidal, according to a source close to the deal. Spotify can’t afford it. Google, which also owns a streaming service, could possibly also be interested for similar reasons as Apple. All this is worth something, but not a ton.\\n\\n\\nOracle ordered to pay HP $3 billion in Itanium case:\\xa0A California jury ordered Oracle \\xa0to pay Hewlett-Packard $3 billion in damages in a case over HP\\'s Itanium servers, an Oracle spokeswoman said on Thursday.\\xa0Oracle said it would appeal the verdict.\\xa0The Itaniuum processor is made by Intel.\\xa0Oracle decided to stop developing software for use with HP\\'s Itanium-based servers in 2011, saying that Intel made it clear that the chip was nearing the end of its life and was shifting its focus to its x86 microprocessor.\\xa0But HP said it had an agreement with Oracle that support for Itanium would continue, without which the equipment using the chip would become obsolete.\"HP is gratified by the jury\\'s verdict, which affirms what HP has always known and the evidence overwhelmingly showed,\" John Schultz, executive vice president and general counsel of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, said in an e-mailed statement, saying that Oracle\\'s decision to stop the software development \"was a clear breach of contract.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook to Change News Feed to Focus on Friends and Family:\\xa0For years, Facebook has courted publishers of all sizes, asking them to depend more and more on the social media giant to expand their audiences. Now, Facebook has a new message for publishers: Tamp down your expectations.\\xa0Facebook said on Wednesday that it planned to make a series of changes to its news feed algorithm so that it will more favorably promote content posted by the friends and family of users.\\xa0The side effect of those changes, the company said, is that content posted by publishers will show up less prominently in news feeds, resulting in significantly less traffic to the hundreds of news media sites that have come to rely on Facebook.\\xa0The move underscores the never-ending algorithm-tweaking that Facebook undertakes to maintain interest in its news feed, the company’s marquee feature that is seen by more than 1.65 billion users every month.\\xa0It is also a reminder that while Facebook is vastly important to the long-term growth of news media companies, from older outlets like The New York Times and The Washington Post to upstarts like BuzzFeed, Vice and Vox Media, publishers rank lower on Facebook’s list of priorities.\\n\\n\\nLanding with a bump? Germany\\'s Rocket falls back to earth:\\xa0When German e-commerce investor Rocket Internet launched Jumia in 2012 as a would-be African Amazon, it was optimistic that a rapidly expanding middle class would quickly shift from street markets to shopping online.\\xa0Four years on, falling sales for sites like Jumia and slower growth from Nigeria to Russia and Brazil is casting doubt on Rocket Internet\\'s ambition to become the world\\'s biggest Internet company outside the United States and China.\\xa0Jumia made a loss of 17 million euros ($18.8 million) in the first three months of 2016 on sales that fell more than a third. The devaluation of Nigeria\\'s naira last week is a new blow for Jumia, which now operates in more than 20 countries in Africa. Revenue growth has also slowed at most of Rocket Internet\\'s other 11 leading start-ups, ranging from furniture e-commerce and food delivery in Europe to online fashion in markets from India to Latin America and the Middle East.\\xa0That is the consequence of Rocket\\'s shift to rein in spending on marketing and logistics as it seeks to stem losses which it said peaked at 1 billion euros in 2015.\\xa0As a result, shareholders have cast doubt on the valuation Rocket has put on its portfolio and questioned the strategy of sending business school graduates to set up 150 start-ups in more than 110 countries in just a few years.\\xa0Exclusive interviews with shareholders reveal growing scepticism about Rocket\\'s sprawling empire as emerging markets sour and technology stocks cool. Its share price has fallen 39 percent this year.\\n\\n\\nGoogle Capital Makes First Public Company Investment in Care.com.\\xa0Shares in Care.com Inc soared 18 percent in extended trading, after the home care provider announced a $46.35 million investment from Google Capital, the growth equity arm of Alphabet Inc.\\xa0Google Capital’s investment makes it the largest shareholder in Care.com, and Laela Sturdy, a partner at the fund, will join the company’s board, Care.com said Wednesday in a statement. The company provides child, adult, senior, pet and home-care services and had a market capitalization of $276 million as of Wednesday.\\xa0Google Capital was founded in 2013 and has invested in numerous private companies. It pairs its companies with advisers spread across Alphabet, and in the last six months has tapped 300 different people to give advice to its companies, Sturdy said. This deal marks its first investment in a public company.Care.com said it used a portion of the Google Capital investment to repurchase 3.7 million shares of its common stock from Matrix Partners at a price of $8.25 per share, a 5 percent discount to the 30-day volume-weighted average price. It also issued a new series of convertible preferred stock to Google Capital at an initial conversion price of $10.50 per share. Dividends on the stock will accrue at 5.5 percent annually, the company said.\\xa0Matrix had been an investor since 2006 and wanted to make some divestments, so it was a good time to do a buyback, said Sheila Marcelo, Care.com chairwoman and chief executive officer. “It helps us reduce pressure on our stock,” she said.\\n\\n\\nIt’s official: Kleiner just pulled off a $1.4 billion fundraise:\\xa0So much for losing its mojo.\\xa0Despite twists and turns in recent years that have sometimes rivaled those of a telenovela, and even with its most famous member, John Doerr, no longer a general partner, Kleiner Perkins has raised two new funds totaling $1.4 billion, show newly processed SEC filings.\\xa0The firm’s digital growth fund — its third — has secured $1 billion in commitments. The capital will be managed by Mary Meeker, Ted Schlein, Mood Rowghani and Noah Knauf, who very recently joined Kleiner from Warburg Pincus.\\xa0Kleiner’s newest (17th!) early-stage fund, meanwhile, has closed with $400 million in commitments. As you’ve read here recently, Kleiner’s early-stage team now features five general partners: Schlein, Mike Abbott, Eric Feng, Beth Seidenberg and Wen Hsieh.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLyft Tells Investors to Expect No Growth in Rides for June:\\xa0Lyft Inc. may be hitting a wall in its war with its richer competitor.\\xa0Lyft told investors in a recent memo obtained by Bloomberg that it expects the number of rides it handles to be flat or down in June, compared with May. That follows a record month for rides in May.\\xa0Lyft expects to beat its target for second-quarter ride volume by 35 percent, Lyft told its investors. \"This implies June will be flat to slightly down from the record May level given we face traditional seasonality headwinds in June as most college students leave their campuses for the summer,\" the note said. \"Additionally, June represents the first full month without Austin, after pausing operations in the city in May.\" (Uber and Lyft pulled out of Austin, Texas, after the city passed legislation that would require them to conduct fingerprinted background checks on their drivers.) \\xa0One Lyft investor told Bloomberg that, given the company’s heavy losses, if Lyft could sell itself for $5.5 billion -- the value of the company at its latest valuation -- that would be an acceptable price. Qatalyst could also help the startup sell a stake, rather than the whole business.\\xa0The company also said in the memo that it reached a nearly $1.9 billion annual revenue run rate based on its performance in May. In November, it touted a $1 billion run rate. Revenue run rates apply monthly figures to a 12-month period. Investors use them to gauge the potential for growing businesses.While Lyft expects to lose hundreds of millions this year, Uber has lost money on a much larger scale. In three quarters last year Uber lost $1.7 billion. The company has committed to spending billions in China and India, and Uber has continued to subsidize rides against its global competitors like Didi Chuxing and Ola. Like Lyft, as a private company, Uber’s financials are private.\\n\\n\\nAirbnb’s new funding round makes it the second-most valuable startup in the United States:\\xa0Last year, Airbnb raised $1.5 billion at a $25.5 billion valuation. Earlier this month, the companyraised $1 billion in debt financing.\\xa0And now, sources close to the company tell Recode, Airbnb is currently raising an undisclosed amount of cash at a $30 billion valuation. Such a deal would make Airbnb the second-most valuable startup in the United States, trailing only the $62.5 billion Uber. The New York Times first reporteddetails of Airbnb’s latest round.\\xa0With all the new money, Airbnb plans to grow its global operation. Bloomberg has previously reported that the company plans to add booking features later this year for things beyond short-term home rentals (think museums, restaurants, etc.).\\xa0In the meantime, Airbnb is being kept busy on the legal front. Earlier this week the company filed suit against the city of San Francisco for imposing stiff penalties on home rental registration rules that Airbnb helped write.\\xa0The company is also locked in a battle with the New York government, where state legislatorsrecently passed a bill that would further restrict the company’s listings.\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon Expands Items on Dash Buttons as Order Rate Doubles:\\xa0Amazon.com Inc. has added more than 50 new brands to its Dash Button service for instantly reordering everyday items, citing a doubling in the frequency of orders over the last three months. After introducing the WiFi-connected plastic tabsthat can be mounted to the fridge, washing machine or kitchen cupboard in 2015, the online retailing giant has steadily increased the number of brands available for replenishment to more than 150, Amazon said in a statement Thursday. Amazon also expanded its product categories to include toys, such as Play-Doh and NERF darts and added new items like Campbell’s Soup and Cascade dishwashing soap.\\xa0Members of Amazon Prime, which offers free two-day delivery on many items, are placing orders at a pace of more than twice a minute, Amazon said, up from once a minute three months ago. Total orders increased more than 70 percent in the last three months.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLyft Is Said to Hire Qatalyst as Uber’s Rival Explores Deals:\\xa0Lyft Inc., the second-largest U.S. ride-hailing startup, is working with Qatalyst Partners LP to explore deal options, said a person familiar with the matter.\\xa0Qatalyst, an investment bank founded by Wall Street veteran Frank Quattrone, has orchestrated high-profile sales of technology companies. Lyft and Qatalyst declined to comment.\\xa0The Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported the hiring, said Quattrone has contacted large automakers about buying a stake in Lyft. In January, Lyft said General Motors invested $500 million into the San Francisco company.\\xa0Lyft, which was last valued at $5.5 billion, has been overshadowed by Uber. While Lyft only operates in the U.S., it has teamed up with China’s Didi Chuxing and other global ride-hailing companies to form an alliance to take on Uber.\\n\\n\\nJD.com Loses Luster as Hedge Funds Backpedal Amid Slowing Growth:JD.com Inc., the Chinese online retailer that a year ago was a favorite among hedge fund managers including Tiger Management LLC’s Julian Robertson, is quickly losing its allure.\\xa0The U.S.-traded stock has plunged 37 percent this year, wiping out almost $17 billion in market value. The number of shares borrowed for short selling touched a record on June 15 after more than doubling in less than a month. Hedge funds including Tiger and Lone Pine Capital have been bailing out.\\xa0The turnaround comes as China’s slowing economy and intensifying e-commerce competition crimp the company’s expansion. With sales growth flagging, investors are increasingly questioning when, or even if, the 12-year-old company will ever become profitable.After revenue more than quadrupled over the past three years, the shortcomings of the country’s second-largest e-commerce company are now being laid bare by China’s slowing consumption.\\xa0JD.com’s self-owned inventory and logistics have helped it grab market share by offering authentic products and speedy shipping. That model, similar to Amazon.com Inc.’s, also has driven up costs and led to operating losses as the company builds warehouses and employs more than 59,000 delivery staff, more than the total number of employees of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., its larger Chinese competitor.The stock slump has deepened since May 9, when JD.com said first-quarter revenue growth fell to 47 percent, from 57 percent the previous period. Its loss widened to 10 cents per share, from 8 cents a year earlier. The company warned that revenue may increase as little as 40 percent in the second quarter.\\n\\n\\nAmazon Unveils Online Education Service for Teachers:\\xa0Just ahead of the back-to-school season, Amazon plans to make a major foray into the education technology market for primary and secondary schools, a territory that Apple, Google and Microsoft have heavily staked out.\\xa0Monday morning, Amazon said that it would introduce an online marketplace with tens of thousands of free lesson plans, worksheets and other instructional materials for teachers in late August or early September.\\xa0Called Amazon Inspire, the education site has features that may seem familiar to frequent Amazon shoppers. Search bar at the top of the page? Check. User reviews? Check. Star ratings for each product? Check.\\xa0By starting out with a free resources service for teachers, Amazon is establishing a foothold that could expand into a one-stop shopping marketplace — not just for paid learning materials, but for schools’ wider academic and institutional software needs, said Tory Patterson, co-founder of Owl Ventures, a venture capital fund that invests in ed tech start-ups.\\xa0Amazon is joining other tech industry giants in a push to expand the use of technology in the public schools.\\xa0Last year, primary and secondary schools in the United States spent $4.9 billion on tablet, laptop and desktop computers, according to a report by Linn Huang, a research director at the International Data Corporation, a market research firm known as IDC. Schools bought 10.8 million Apple, Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows devices in 2015, he said.\\xa0Because its devices tend to cost more, Apple accounted for the largest slice of school computer sales, amounting to $2.2 billion, Mr. Huang said. By volume, however, Chromebooks — the inexpensive laptops that run on Google’s Chrome operating system — have taken schools by storm, accounting for more than five million devices bought last year, he said.\\xa0Even so, ed tech industry analysts said the growing market for digital educational materials, which Amazon is entering, is likely to prove much more valuable over time than the school computer market.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBrexit Pounds Some Technology Companies:\\xa0Online marketplace operator EBay sank as much as 8.2 percent on Friday, outpacing declines by the wider U.S. equity market as analysts singled it out for its large exposure to the U.K. and Germany. Chipmaker ARM, based in Cambridge, U.K., gained as much as 6.8 percent on calculations that a weaker British pound will make its repatriated earnings more valuable.\\xa0The pound sank more than 8 percent against the U.S. currency Friday, to its lowest level in 30 years. The U.S. dollar rose 2 percent against a basket of foreign currencies tracked by Bloomberg. A strong dollar hurts mainly when proceeds from goods and services sold in foreign currencies are exchanged into dollars. That can also make it more expensive to buy U.S. tech products.\\xa0EBay has the most significant exposure among U.S. internet companies to the U.K. and Europe, according a report by Needham & Co. The disruption caused by Britain’s exit from the EU and currency fluctuations could slow cross-border transactions on online marketplaces.\\xa0\"EBay gets 31 percent of revenue from U.K. and Germany, more than Google or Amazon,\" said Needham analyst Kerry Rice. \"This really impacts cross-border trade more than anything. It could shift spending behavior if currency fluctuations make a purchase cost-prohibitive.\" ARM investors were quick to turn to its own calculations on the impact of currency moves and bet on an increase in profit. The company, which licenses chip technology and designs, gets more than a third of its sales from the U.S., 19 percent from China and another 25 percent from Taiwan and South Korea. Singapore and Switzerland supply it with more revenue than its home market at around 3 percent each, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\\xa0According to a company presentation from April, more than 95 percent of ARM’s sales are in dollars. A 10 percent move in the value of the pound against the dollar moves earnings per share by 15 percent, it said. That suggests the recent drop in the British currency could boost profit by about 10 percent for the rest of this year.\\n\\n\\nChina Tightens Internet Rules for Baidu and Other Search Engines:\\xa0Chinese authorities will require Baidu Inc. and other search engines to report banned content and verify advertisers’ qualifications in its latest attempt at Internet regulation.\\xa0Under rules to take effect Aug. 1, search engines operating in the country will be prohibited from providing banned information in various formats including links, summaries, cached pages, associative words, related searches and relevant recommendations, the Cyberspace Administration of China said in a statement. They will also be required to report websites and applications that contain prohibited content when spotted, the regulator said. Baidu, China’s biggest search engine, has been criticized recently for misleading users with search results. The Cyberspace Administration launched aninvestigation earlier this year after the death of Wei Zexi, a 21-year-old computer science major, who sought out a controversial treatment advertised among search results. Baidu said it would restrict the number of sponsored posts to 30 percent of a results page and establish a 1 billion yuan ($151 million) fund to fight fraud after the death of the student.\\n\\n\\nLine, the biggest tech IPO of the year, struggles to show its growth plan can work:\\xa0In delaying its IPO by two years, Japanese messaging app company Line Corp bought time to correct weak financial reporting controls, work on its business plan, bolster staffing - and left billions of dollars on the table as its valuation shriveled.\\xa0Line\\'s initial public offering in the next three weeks is set to raise about $1 billion, which given a global drought of such deals could make it the biggest tech listing this year, but skeptical fund managers point to tepid growth in Line\\'s home market and doubts about its prospects for regional expansion. They also question whether its advertising revenue strategy will work.\\xa0Fund managers who have watched Line\\'s growth slow in a crowded global messaging app market assess the plan with caution.\\xa0\"I\\'m not interested,\" said Yasuo Sakuma, portfolio manager at Bayview Asset Management, which manages 270 billion yen ($2.64 billion). \"Its growth outlook is very poor.\"\\xa0\"Among the four countries that it\\'s focusing on, only Indonesia has big room for growth in use,\" he added. \"Even there, the business outlook is not that easy.\"\\xa0Growth in Line\\'s monthly active users has tailed off after tripling across the world over the past three years. Last year, user numbers rose just 13 million to 218 million at the end of March, the IPO filing showed. The company isn\\'t providing much visibility about the future either - it says in its filing that limited operating history makes it \"difficult\" to forecast future results.\\xa0\"I went to the company\\'s meeting with investors... but nothing moved me,\" said a fund manager at a major Japanese asset management firm who declined to be named because of company rules against discussing individual shares. \"It\\'s not clear how it can make money out of its advertisement business.\"\\xa0Line\\'s likely valuation is far less than the $10 billion-$20 billion that was expected by investors when South Korean parent Naver Corp previously talked of a Line listing in 2013-2014, although Line may not have had much choice but to wait.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",
      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\nTwilio, a Cloud-Based Business, Soars After Its IPO:\\xa0Shares of Twilio, a maker of software that helps companies like Uber and Nordstrom communicate with their customers, soared 92 percent on Thursday, their first day of trading after becoming the largest technology initial public offering of stock so far this year.\\xa0Twilio began trading in a market that has not been receptive to tech initial offerings. Only three technology companies have made their debuts so far in 2016.The company said on Wednesday that it had raised $150 million, pricing 10 million shares at $15 each, above the range it marketed to investors. The I.P.O. price yielded a market valuation of $1.2 billion, slightly higher than the $1.1 billion valuation Twilio received in a private funding round a year ago.\\xa0Twilio, based in San Francisco, has been hailed as a trailblazer compared with the almost 170 unicorns — companies with valuations above $1 billion — that have chosen to stay private for now. Twilio was a test of investor receptivity to the software company’s finances, which show 88 percent revenue growth over last year but consistent net losses. As markets became more uncertain, investors preferred that companies going public turn a profit.\\xa0Twilio had $167 million in revenue last year from about 25,000 active customer accounts. WhatsApp, the messaging service owned by Facebook, represented 17 percent of that revenue.\\n\\n\\nInMobi, fined $1m for tracking users, had fine reduced based on \\'company\\'s financial condition\\':\\xa0Mobile advertising network InMobi has been fined $950,000 by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for tracking the locations of millions of consumers, including children, without their knowledge or consent. InMobi was subject to a $4-million civil penalty, but it was reduced to $950,000 based on the company\\'s financial condition. In addition, the company will be required to delete all information it collected from children, and will be prohibited from further violations of the Children\\'s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).\\n\\n\\nBlackBerry Rises on Profit Forecast After More Software Gains:\\xa0BlackBerry Ltd. rose as much as 4.6 percent after forecasting better-than-expected profit and insisting there was a way to make its ever-shrinking phone business profitable again. Fiscal first-quarter earnings per share, excluding some items, broke even, compared with analysts’ average estimate of a loss of 7 cents. Revenue in the quarter was $424 million, including software and services revenue of $166 million that was 21 percent higher than the same period last year ($137 million). Analysts had estimated total revenue of $471 million. BlackBerry changed its reporting structure to include revenue from both smartphone sales and licensing deals. The new unit -- “mobility solutions” -- accounted for 36 percent of revenue. The company sold 500,000 devices in the quarter, compared with 600,000 in the previous quarter. Shares gained 2.4 percent to $6.90 at 9:57 a.m., after reaching as high as $7.05 in New York in Thursday.\\n\\n\\nUber switches out surge for price transparency:\\xa0No more pop-ups asking you to agree to those murky “2.1x” (or some other “x” amount) surge fares on the Uber app. Soon Uber will just tell you the price of your ride up front. Uber pricing will still fluctuate with demand, but now you’ll know the dollar amount you’ll be paying for the ride, instead; “no math and no surprises,” says Uber. The new costs are calculated similarly to the old “x” surge pricing so you might still end up paying a ridiculous sum in certain places or times of day where demand for a ride home is going to be high.\\xa0The price is based on expected time, distance, traffic, the number of riders requesting rides at that time and the number of drivers available nearby, but at least now you’ll know exactly how much of a punch the ride will make to your bank account. Uber will also allow either the driver or rider to update the app if you change your destination in the middle of the ride and says you’ll get a notification in the app with the change in price. The rideshare company also told me you won’t have to worry if your Uber driver goes way off the map and tries to charge you more or if the route is suddenly busy and they need to change course. The price you agreed on will still be the price you pay. So no more lightning bolts and pop-up screens asking you to agree to “3x” surge or whatever it is after you stumble out of the bar or head all the way across town. Just like with hotels and airfare, the prices change all the time, but you’ll know what the price is before you book. According to Uber, “hundreds of thousands of riders” have already received the pricing transparency rollout — including those in Miami, San Diego, Seattle, New Jersey, New York and some of the bigger cities in India like Mumbai and Hyderabad. Uber plans to roll out the changes to pricing in the app globally in the next few months.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClash of Clans May Spur Tencent’s Marvel-Like Aspirations:\\xa0Tencent is spending $8.6 billion to gain control of Supercell Oy -- the Finnish maker of mobile games including Hay Day, Clash Royale and Boom Beach -- from SoftBank Group Corp. To see how that portfolio may fit into Tencent’s emerging entertainment empire, look at how the Chinese company leveraged World of Warcraft and League of Legends into global powerhouses.League of Legend’s 67 million monthly users helped Tencent earn $9 billion in game revenue last year, and the Tencent-backed movie “Warcraft” is setting box-office records in China since this month’s release. Acquiring Supercell reinforces Tencent’s entertainment aspirations against Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc., and comes after Tencent bought the rights to 300-plus Japanese anime franchises in a push to become a worldwide multimedia brand like Marvel, DC and Disney.\\xa0“Tencent has taken on a strategy to convert good IPs into movies and anime,” said Mark Tanner, founder of China Skinny, a Shanghai-based research and marketing agency. “It’s creating a world of superhero characters for entertainment.”\\xa0Supercell occupied the top spot on researcher App Annie’s rankings of publishers fortwo years running. Clash of Clans was named an “essential” app by Apple Inc. and was promoted during the 2015 Super Bowl in a commercial featuring Academy Award-nominee Liam Neeson. Yet the game hasn’t been among the 10 top-grossing apps in China and Japan’s iOS Store since 2015, which is where Tencent’s clout can help.The company’s QQ and WeChat instant messaging apps have more than a billion users combined, and it could use those apps to promote Supercell games, Tanner said. That distribution system helped Tencent’s mobile-game revenue increase 16 percent to 8.2 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) in the quarter ending March 31, compared with the previous three months. China’s mobile gaming market expected to reach 68.8 billion yuan by 2018.\\xa0“We do see there’s an opportunity for IPs of games and movies and video to cross and splice with each other, in the right way,” Martin Lau, Tencent’s president, said during a conference call Tuesday.\\n\\n\\nOkta hires Goldman Sachs to lead IPO or sale:\\xa0Okta Inc, a U.S. cloud identity management company valued at $1.2 billion in its latest private fundraising round, has hired Goldman Sachs Group to lead an initial public offering or outright sale, people familiar with the matter said.\\xa0Okta\\'s exploration of both an IPO and a sale underscores the dilemma faced by several technology companies this year, as frothy stock market valuations of many of their peers begin to come down, prompting potential buyers to enter the fray.\\xa0Okta could file for an IPO as early as the second half of this year, the people said this week. However, the San Francisco-based company has also held talks with technology peers about being acquired, and could pursue a sale if it believes it can fetch a significantly higher valuation than in an IPO, the people added.Okta helps companies organize passwords and authenticate the identity of employees who log into work applications made by other software firms. Its customers include satellite TV provider Dish Network Corp and hospitality company MGM Resorts International.\\xa0Okta has raised a total of roughly $230 million to date with investors such as Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock Partners and Khosla Ventures, Janus Capital Group and Altimeter Capital.\\n\\n\\nTwilio prices its IPO at $15 per share, above its previous target:\\xa0Twilio today said it would price its initial public offering at $15 per share, which would value the company at around $1.23 billion.\\xa0That would value Twilio above its previous $1 billion valuation from its last financing round. With the pricing, the company expects to raise around $150 million, with an option for another 1.5 million shares to be purchased. It’s also a higher price than the $12-$14 per share price that the company previously targeted.\\xa0Twilio’s IPO will be an important one given the drought of tech IPOs this year. Anxiety has gripped many startups that have hit unicorn status given the complete lack of tech IPOs for 2016 (Twilio will only be the third of the year). The hope, for many startups, is that Twilio will re-open the tech IPO window with a strong showing after trading begins tomorrow. If that happens, it might convince investors that many startups that have hit frothy valuations have come back in line with reality, and these companies could be good investment targets if they choose to go public. Twilio is not profitable, with the company reporting a net loss of $35.5 million on $166.9 million in revenue last year. But it’s showing strong revenue growth, with the company bringing in $88.8 million in revenue from 2014.\\xa0In total, Twilio has raised more than $200 million in venture financing, with Bessemer Venture Partners owning the largest chunk of the company at 28.5 percent per its last IPO filing. Twilio is expected to start trading tomorrow, and we’ll see whether or not the appetite for tech IPOs will be coming back with its performance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTesla offers $2.8 billion for SolarCity in \\'no brainer\\' deal for Musk:\\xa0Tesla’s stock drove off a cliff\\xa0after the SolarCity bid was announced, and\\xa0Elon Musk and his family could stand to gain $700 million\\xa0in Tesla shares from SolarCity deal:\\xa0Elon Musk on Tuesday sought to build a clean energy powerhouse as his electric car maker, Tesla Motors , made an offer to buy his solar installation firm SolarCity Corp in a stock deal worth as much as $2.8 billion.\\xa0Tesla shares plunged more than 13 percent to $189.99 in extended trading - amounting to a loss in value of about $4.3 billion, or more than the value of the offer for the other company. Shares of SolarCity rose about 18 percent to $25.02.\\xa0Musk, who is the chairman of SolarCity, CEO of Tesla and the largest shareholder of both companies, described the deal as a \"no brainer\" in a call with reporters.\\xa0Tesla investors punished the company\\'s shares, however. \\xa0Musk, who owns 19 percent of Tesla and 22 percent of SolarCity, said he would recuse himself from voting on the deal.

Now he is leaving, in an abrupt shakeout that shows cracks in SoftBank’s global ambitions.\\xa0When the executive, Nikesh Arora, was poached two years ago from a coveted role as Google’s head of business operations, the hire was widely considered a coup for SoftBank. Its billionaire founder and chief executive, Masayoshi Son, crowned Mr. Arora heir apparent.\\xa0Mr. Arora was vaunted for his deal-making prowess and seen as an international executive who would help transform SoftBank with a flurry of investments. One of Mr. Son’s most cherished ambitions was to turn SoftBank, a Japanese business with some notable overseas names like the American carrier Sprint, into a truly global enterprise.\\xa0The honeymoon did not last.Investors have criticized Mr. Arora recently for his record of managing SoftBank’s overseas deals. Investments in start-ups like DramaFever and Housing.com, these shareholders have said, appear to have soured as the companies have faltered.\\xa0And the carefully orchestrated succession plan — or what appeared to be — has collapsed. Mr. Son decided he was not ready to give up the reins soon.\\xa0Mr. Son, 58, said in a statement that he still wanted to “work on a few more crazy ideas” at SoftBank. Mr. Son cited differences over when Mr. Arora would take over as chief executive as the reason he had agreed to step down. Mr. Arora, who was born in India, holds the titles of president and chief operating officer.\\xa0“This will require me to be C.E.O. for at least another five to 10 years — this is not a time frame for me to keep Nikesh waiting for the top job,” Mr. Son said.\\xa0Mr. Arora, 48, also presented the parting as amicable. “Masa and I are still in love with each other,” he posted on Twitter. “I will support everyone I invested in, and they know that.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVR is the future of porn, and it’s a creepy future indeed:\\xa0This got real weird, real fast. And not just because I was demoing the technology in the middle of the E3 floor, surrounded by fellow show-goers. It’s just — well, even after all the explainers in the world, it’s hard to sufficiently brace your mind for all that virtual reality porn entails.\\xa0It occupied a small space, tucked in the rear of the LA Convention Center, but Naughty America may just have had the one booth capable of rivaling Nintendo’s for sheer show buzz. We must have walked by the thing a dozen times during our three days on the floor, and there was always a small army of show-goers lined up to take it for a spin.\\xa0Much like, say, your standard first-person shooter, the technology is built around a POV (point-of-view) shot, putting the viewer in the place of the camera. The effect is already a bit jolting (and, at times nausea-inducing) in standard VR, but all of that really goes next level when you look down and you’ve swapped your bits and bobs with someone else’s.\\xa0The company’s demo cycles through a few short clips, in which the scenery, scenarios and co-stars change, but, well, the view pretty much stays the same. It’s hard to say how much of the initial shock is due to the newness of the technology and how much is firmly entrenched in the uncanny valley, though the company told me that many attendees enjoyed the demo, strange setting and all.Once you get past the somewhat off-putting nature of swapping nether regions with a professional, VR porn does offer an interesting way forward for an industry that, like many others, has been hard hit by the prevalence of free online content.\\n\\n\\nApple May Soon Open Retail Stores in India:\\xa0After months of delays, Apple is likely to open its first retail stores in India, a fast-growing market for smartphones where the American technology giant has little presence.\\xa0New rules issued by the Indian government on Monday exempt foreign-owned companies that want to open stores selling a single brand of products from requirements that 30 percent of the content of those products come from India. The exemption, which lasts three years, can be extended to eight years in the case of companies selling “cutting edge” items, such as Apple’s iPhones and Macs.\\xa0Apple, which makes virtually all of its devices in China, lobbied for months for the loosening, and Timothy D. Cook, the company’s chief executive, discussed it with government officials during his first visit to India last month.An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the issue on Monday. The company has not yet received any formal response from the Indian government on its application to open stores.\\xa0By themselves, new stores will have little impact on Apple’s small market share in India, beyond serving as a marketing tool. Although Indians will buy an estimated 139 million smartphones this year, Android models that cost less than $120 dominate the market, according to the Gartner research firm.Apple says its sales in India grew 56 percent during its last fiscal quarter, but its cheapest phones typically run $400 or more. Its total annual sales in India were around two million units last year, according to Gartner.\\n\\n\\nChinese Curb Cyberattacks on U.S. Interests, Report Finds:\\xa0Nine months after President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China agreed to a broad crackdown on cyberespionage aimed at curbing the theft of intellectual property, the first detailed study of Chinese hacking has found a sharp drop-off in almost daily raids on Silicon Valley firms, military contractors and other commercial targets.\\xa0But the study, conducted by the iSight intelligence unit of FireEye, a company that manages large network breaches, also concluded that the drop-off began a year before Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi announced their accord in the White House Rose Garden. In a conclusion that is largely echoed by American intelligence officials, the study said the change is part of Mr. Xi’s broad effort to bring the Chinese military, which is considered one of the main sponsors of the attacks, further under his control.\\xa0As a result, the same political forces that may be alleviating the theft of data from American companies are also responsible for Mr. Xi’s stunningly swift crackdown on the Chinese media, bloggers and others who could challenge the Communist Party.\\n\\n\\nWal-Mart to Buy 5% Stake in JD.com as Part of Chinese Deal:\\xa0Wal-Mart Stores will acquire a 5 percent stake in Asian e-commerce giant JD.com Inc. in a deal that will reshape the U.S. retail chain’s operations in China.\\xa0As part of the agreement, JD.com will take ownership of Wal-Mart’s Yihaodian online marketplace, the companies said in a statement Monday. The Chinese branch of Sam’s Club also will open a store on JD.com, and the two companies will link up their supply chains.\\xa0The partnership gives Wal-Mart a fresh start in China after it struggled to adapt to a slowing local economy and a rise in online shopping. Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon has said that the company needs to succeed in China, where it estimates that 25 percent of global retail growth will come from in the next five years.A 5 percent stake in JD.com would be worth about $1.5 billion at its current stock price. Wal-Mart will receive about 145 million newly issued Class A shares of JD.com in the transaction. That deal will increase the retailer’s earnings per share by 16 to 19 cents in the second quarter, according to the statement.\\n\\n\\nApple to lose weighting in Russell index, shares could fall:\\xa0After dropping more than $200 billion in market capitalization in one year, Apple shares could fall further as they are set to lose their weighting and be reclassified in the annual reconstitution of the widely followed Russell indexes.\\xa0When all is said and done, about $1.3 billion more will be sold in Apple Inc shares at the market close on Friday, when the reconstitution of the Russell indexes takes effect, according to an analysis by Credit Suisse.\\xa0Because Apple has been aggressively buying back and retiring its stock, outstanding shares have dropped to less than 5.5 billion from 5.8 billion in late June 2015, when the Russell indexes were last recalibrated, according to Reuters data.\\xa0Apple\\'s weighting in the Russell 1000 will roughly fall to 2.52 percent from 2.77 percent, Credit Suisse said. The decline is due to the combination of fewer shares outstanding and Apple\\'s smaller part of the index\\'s capitalization.\\xa0The performance of a market-weighted index is more influenced by larger companies, like Apple.\\xa0Adding to the selling pressure, Apple will be classified as both a value and a growth company at Russell. After the close on Friday, 92 percent of Apple will be considered \"growth\" and 8 percent \"value\" according to index provider FTSE Russell, splitting it between two Russell subindexes.\\xa0The move matters because value managers that peg their investments to the Russell indexes will be buying Apple while growth managers will be selling. Because there are more assets benchmarked to growth than to value, there will be net selling of Apple, said Meera Krishnan, U.S. index strategist at Credit Suisse in New York.\\xa0She estimated there will be over $850 million of selling in Apple out of the growth component of the Russell 1000 and about $400 million of buying from the value side.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhone Tracking, Nude Selfie IOUs See Chinese Bare All for Credit:\\xa0Talkative people pay back loans. The very talkative default. Too taciturn is no good either. Also, don’t take out a loan at 4 a.m.\\xa0Those are lessons from online lenders in China that are tracking people’s behavior -- via apps on their mobile phones -- and taking it into account when deciding what their credit ratings should be. Chinese consumers don’t mind handing over personal details that would spark outrage in the West, in exchange for lower interest rates. WeLab Ltd., a Hong Kong-based online lender that makes loans in China, looks at what apps people have downloaded, where they go using the phone’s GPS tracker, their social networks and their school records. It offers discounted interest rates for each extra piece of personal information that helps profile customers for credit ratings. In Hong Kong, for example, giving WeLab access to a Facebook account gets a 5 percent discount on the cost of a loan, and access to LinkedIn gets you 10 percent off, on loans with interest rates that otherwise reach as high as 20 percent.\\xa0\"Chinese people have no issue handing over their personal data, giving you their credit card number, giving you their bank account,\" said GGV Capital’s Shanghai-based managing partner Jenny Lee, whose Silicon Valley venture capital firm has invested in data-hungry tech giants such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. \"Look at the whole internet finance sector, people are giving you their bank statement so you can do profiling.\"\\xa0Some are perhaps over-sharing. University students desperate for cash have been sending nude photos of themselves as collateral to several online lending platforms, according to the official People’s Daily. Typically they get loans of 15,000 yuan ($2,280) -- more if they’re doctoral students or enrolled at a famous university, the report said, and at least one loan had a weekly interest rate of 30 percent. Delinquent borrowers face the threat of their naked selfies being sent to family if they don’t pay.\\n\\n\\n\\nApple says iPhones still available for sale in China:\\xa0Apple \\xa0said its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were still available for sale in China after Beijing\\'s intellectual property regulators barred their sales saying the designs had infringed a patent held by a Chinese company.\\xa0\"We appealed an administrative order from a regional patent tribunal in Beijing last month and as a result the order has been stayed pending review by the Beijing IP Court,\" Apple said in a statement on Friday.\\xa0The notice, dated May 19, banning sales of certain iPhone models in Beijing was posted on a Chinese government website.\\xa0The Chinese market is vital to Apple, driving more of its sales than any other region outside the United States. But the tech giant has faced greater scrutiny there in recent months, with its online book and film services blocked by Chinese regulators earlier this year.\\xa0Apple historically had enjoyed favorable treatment in China, but Beijing’s crackdown on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus is a reminder that the tech giant is not immune to the scrutiny that other U.S. tech firms have long faced in the country, said analyst Colin Gillis of BGC Partners.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber Rival’s $28 Billion Valuation Shows Size of China’s Ride-Sharing Market:\\xa0The Chinese car-hailing app Didi Chuxing said on Thursday that it had brought in $7.3 billion in its latest round of fund-raising, which included Apple, Alibaba, and SoftBank as investors. The new funds give the company a total of $10.5 billion in disposable funds, and put its valuation at $28 billion, according to a person familiar with the fund-raising. That Didi’s valuation is now almost half that of the $62.5 billion valuation of its main rival in China, Uber, shows how much potential investors see in China. Yet the size of the cash infusions also underscores the market’s difficulties. In part because of China’s widespread blocking of foreign websites, the competition between Uber and Didi marks the first time in recent history a major foreign tech company has vied so intensely with a local Chinese business. In other markets the contest over ride-sharing has focused on regulation and technology, but in China it has been much more about cash, with the two companies spending billions. The most recent round has also pulled in Apple, pitting America’s biggest tech company against America’s best-known start-up, Uber, in a tricky Chinese market. Both see China as critical to growth. The fund-raising comes as executives from Didi and Uber have signaled that they are focusing on profitability in China. Since then both companies have been locked in a spending war. Though it has primarily taken the form of subsidies, both companies have also tried to develop technology specific to China, and have actively wooed both local and national government officials.\\xa0Didi has focused on technology that better predicts car arrival times, given China’s unruly traffic, while Uber has developed a commute function that links drivers with riders based on where they live and work.\\n\\n\\nWhy back-up cameras haven’t stopped drivers from backing into stuff:\\xa0With or without eyes in the back of their heads, drivers keep hitting things.\\xa0Despite the growing prevalence of back-up cameras, federal data shows that this technology hasn\\'t significantly cut down on cars backing into people and causing them harm. That research on so-called \"back-over incidents\" comes as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration moves to make back-up cameras standard and presses automakers to add a bevy of new technologies -- from automatic braking to lane collision warnings -- to even entry-level cars to reduce accidents on the road.As car companies and even regulators increasingly lean on technology to make roads safer, the tepid success of the back-up camera is a red flag. Sure, drivers can see more of what\\'s behind them -- the cameras reduce blind zones while in reverse by 90 percent, according to a study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety -- but they keep hitting things.Even with back-up cameras, drivers still don’t look around their vehicles enough when in reverse and sometimes get distracted by any number of things as their cars roll backward. Back-up cameras also often beam images to display screens in the front of the car, and drivers can become too reliant on them. Instead of looking backward and through their rearview window or checking mirrors, their eyes are glued to a screen.\\n\\n\\nLG Electronics sells mosquito-repelling TV in India:\\xa0The Indian arm of South Korea\\'s LG Electronics Inc has begun selling a TV with a feature that it says repels mosquitoes, which can spread diseases such as malaria, Zika and dengue.\\xa0The TV\\'s \"Mosquito Away Technology\" uses ultrasonic waves that are inaudible to humans but cause mosquitoes to fly away, according to the company. It was released in the country on Thursday, LG said.\\xa0The same technology, which was certified as effective by an independent laboratory near Chennai, India, has been used by LG in air conditioners and washing machines, the company said.\\xa0The technology, which also functions when the TV is switched off, is available in two models, priced at 26,500 rupees and 47,500 rupees ($394 and $706).\\xa0The TV is targeted at lower-income consumers living in conditions that would make them vulnerable to mosquitoes.\\xa0It will go on sale next month in the Philippines and Sri Lanka. Kim Sang-yeol, an LG Electronics official, said there are no plans for now to market it elsewhere.\\n\\n\\nOracle\\'s cloud strength boosts quarterly revenue:\\xa0Business software maker Oracle Corp reported a higher-than-expected quarterly revenue as sales in its cloud business surged due to more customers.\\xa0Shares of the Redwood City, California-based company rose as much as 3.8 percent to $40.10 in extended trading on Thursday.\\xa0Like its rivals such as SAP SE, IBM Corp and Microsoft Corp, Oracle has focused on moving its business toward the cloud-computing model, essentially providing services remotely via data centers rather than selling installed software.\\xa0Total revenue from the company\\'s cloud-computing software and platform service rose 49.1 percent to $859 million in the fourth quarter ended May 31.

While he would not give details of the effort, sources said Salesforce was primarily interested in LinkedIn\\'s recruiting business, which makes up the bulk of its revenue. Sources said LinkedIn was already deep into negotiations with Microsoft when Salesforce made its approach, which would have required both debt and stock financing. Microsoft was able to buy LinkedIn in cash and also promised to let it operate independently. Interestingly, sources confirmed numerous reports that Microsoft had tried to buy Salesforce earlier this year, and both price and the way it would be operated within the company were among the issues that resulted in it not happening. Indeed. Salesforce recently bought Demandware for $2.8 billion.\\n\\n\\nInMobi Technologies to discontinue use of mascot function on Miip platform:\\xa0\\xa0InMobi on Thursday said it has shuttered the animated-discovery commerce part of Miip for now, a product it launched amid much fanfare in July last year. Instead, the firm will look to help e-commerce companies reach inactive customers using more traditional ad formats, using the underlying technology it built for the platform. In July, InMobi launched a beta version of Miip, which took the form of an animated monkey, that tracked users’ browsing habits across various mobile apps and showed ads in the forms of bubbles and animations instead of traditional display ads. It allowed consumers to interact with the mascot and tell it what they liked, and how they felt about the products and ads they saw. The promise of such a technology was that first, it enabled personalised discovery of products, and second, the completion of purchases within the ad itself as InMobi had tied up with payments providers like Stripe, AliPay and Paytm. This hasn’t worked out.\\xa0“The larger vision behind Miip is to enable consumers to buy products and complete transactions through ads. The mascot was conceptualized simply as a ‘face’ to the Miip platform. Over the course of testing, users responded better to an advertiser’s brand as against the Miip branding on an ad unit,” said Arun Pattabhiraman, vice president and global head of marketing, InMobi\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGood VR is great — and bad VR is abysmal:\\xa0VR is a powerful medium, but difficult to work with — because the developer is put in the position of creating a sense of self and presence, more is required of them, and while successes are almost impossible to describe properly, failures are conspicuous and easily dissected. It’s easiest to illustrate with actual examples. Easily the most interesting VR experience I’ve had at E3 (of a dozen or so) was an Oculus demo called “The Climb,” by a team at Crytek. Using the Touch controllers (a new innovation; previously a gamepad was used), you manipulate a pair of disembodied hands, gripping ridges and cracks to make your way up a cliff face. Like many VR games, it sounds rather… boring. In fact, it’s genius, but only within VR — and like so many other games, the only way to find that out is to play it. Nevertheless, It’s excellent for several reasons, and these act as sort of guidelines for content that fits VR’s strengths and avoid its weaknesses. Alas, I was disappointed by “Final Fantasy XV: The VR Experience,” despite being hyped for the game itself. Here, I found, was the worst possible outcome: a game that should and could be interesting, but does almost nothing right.\\xa0Unlike “The Climb,” it sounds like a blast on paper. You and the other main characters from the game are in a battle with a Behemoth, one of the game’s most well-known monsters. You’re Prompto, the one who has a gun, supporting your buddies as they fight hand to hand. What it amounts to, however, and I’m heartily sorry to say it, is a disjointed and boring five minutes that may leave you less excited for the game than when you donned the headset.\\n\\n\\nWhat are leveraged loans and why does Uber want one?\\xa0Uber, fresh off $3.5 billion from the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund, is in talks to closeanother $1-2 billion in the form of leveraged loans.\\xa0Over the last 24 hours, the term “leveraged loans” has been thrown around a lot, but few in the startup world have seen this term before.The Wall Street Journal reported that the company would like to settle on a 4-4.5 percent interest rate. This appears ambitious but let’s assume that it is accurate.\\xa0While not completely applicable, Apple issued $12 billion in bonds at a 3.22 percent blended interest rate excluding floating rate debt. Yes, 4.5 percent is greater than 3.22 percent but junk bond references by the Wall Street Journal and Recode should be taken lightly. Junk bonds can generate upwards of 7 percent interest. Plenty of well-known publicly traded companies have issued bonds at rates higher than 4.5 percent and survived to fight another day. Yes, both leveraged loans and junk bonds have higher-than-normal interest rates. Unlike junk bonds, a 4-4.5 percent interest rate for Uber shouldn’t invoke images of the subprime mortgage crisis.\\n\\n\\nSpaceX’s latest rocket landing ended in a ‘rapid unscheduled disassembly’:\\xa0Elon Musk\\'s SpaceX failed to complete what would have been its fifth landing of a reusable booster rocket Wednesday, a down note on what appeared to be an otherwise successful mission to deliver two Boeing-built communication satellites to high orbit above the Earth.\\xa0\"Falcon 9 was lost in this attempt,\" the company said in its webcast.\\xa0As the satellites headed on their way Wednesday, the booster rocket began its descent toward the ocean for a landing on a special floating platform. Video footage of the attempt seemed to show the booster touching down, then flames, before the picture froze.As with previous attempts, SpaceX had said landing the reusable booster rocket would be made more difficult by the fact that it would be falling from higher up. And, the company said, the rocket would have less fuel than normal to control its descent. SpaceX founder Elon Musk later tweeted that it appeared the the thrust in one of three landing engines was insufficient, causing the rocket to come in far too fast. In what he said may have been SpaceX\\'s \"hardest impact\" ever, the booster ultimately suffered an RUD, or \"rapid unscheduled disassembly.\" Upgrades to compensate for the problem could come by year\\'s end, said Musk.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

Now it may add something new to the list: the leveraged loan market.\\xa0The ride-hailing start-up is looking to issue as much as $2 billion in securities to investors, said a person briefed on the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are managing the process, said the person, adding that the deal has not begun yet and may still fall apart.By tapping leveraged loans, Uber is adding to its trove of billions made up of many types of securities, which the company has been spending as it expands worldwide. Uber has raised equity from traditional venture capital sources, strategic corporate investors and private equity. This month, the company said that it had raised $3.5 billion from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. Uber has also raised billions in convertible debt, which can be exchanged for equity at a future date.\\xa0Uber has redefined private fund-raising, drawing hundreds of millions in new cash or debt at a rapid pace of once every few months. The company needs financing as it now operates in at least 69 countries and is fighting an expensive battle in China against a rival, Didi Chuxing, which is also raising money to expand.\\xa0Leveraged loans are rarely used among start-ups. A leveraged loan is a security issued to a company that has a lot of debt on its books already, and thus is perceived by investors as being a higher risk. The loans are typically used for leveraged buyouts and are seldom seen in Silicon Valley.\\xa0Uber has been able to tap less traditional funding sources because investors think its size and scale make it a safer bet than other Silicon Valley companies. Uber’s valuation of $62.5 billion — making it the highest valued venture-backed start-up in the world — would not change with this new investment.\\xa0Leveraged loans also allow Uber to raise money without diluting the holdings of its many equity investors — some of which have been through more than a dozen rounds of financing.\\n\\n\\nTwitter has invested in music streaming service SoundCloud:\\xa0Two years ago Twitter thought about buying SoundCloud, but ended up walking away from the music service.\\xa0Now Twitter has bought a piece of SoundCloud instead.\\xa0Twitter has invested around $70 million in the music service, as part of a round that should end up in the $100 million-range, according to sources familiar with the deal. The round is expected to value SoundCloud at about $700 million — the same value that investors placed on the company in 2014, when it raised $60 million; since then it has also raised a debt round. It’s unclear whether the Twitter investment is part of a strategic partnership, but that would make sense: Twitter might view via an integration with SoundCloud as a way to increase growth and engagement, and SoundCloud may look at Twitter as a way to promote its newly launched subscription service, which is crucial to the company’s plans.\\xa0And both companies could use some help. Twitter has been punished by Wall Street for its inability to add users at a rapid clip; SoundCloud’s flat valuation indicates that investors are also worried about its own growth prospects.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba Tries to Shore Up Investors’ Confidence:\\xa0The Alibaba Group of China has disappointed investors since its record-breaking American stock listing nearly two years ago, as volatile financial results and regulatory run-ins have driven the price of its shares down almost to where they began.\\xa0Now the e-commerce giant is trying to reassure.\\xa0For the first time, Alibaba on Tuesday offered investors financial guidance for the coming year, saying that it expected revenue growth to accelerate from last year’s pace. At a meeting at its Hangzhou headquarters, Alibaba cited strength in its core business, despite China’s slowing economic growth, as well as benefits from new ventures that have raised eyebrows among some investors\\xa0The forecast comes as Alibaba seeks to demonstrate that its strategy, which has long focused on growth, is good for business.\\xa0In China, Alibaba operates online sales platforms that connect consumers with mom-and-pop stores, as well as with global brands like Burberry and Zara. It has been showing sales growth on its platforms using a measure called gross merchandise volume, a yardstick for transactions across its platforms.\\xa0Alibaba said on Tuesday that it would de-emphasize that figure, saying it would no longer report it quarterly. It will continue to report an annual figure, and offered a target for 2020.\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia\\'s Space Program Takes On Elon Musk:\\xa0India’s space agency will launch a record 22 satellites on a single rocket as it tries to ease a global backlog and demonstrate the ability to compete with commercial spaceflight companies run by billionaires Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.Satellites from the U.S., India, Canada and Germany will enter orbit after a scheduled June 20 liftoff from the Sriharikota barrier island along the southeast coast, the agency’s chairman, A.S. Kiran Kumar, said in an interview in Bengaluru.The 22 machines being launched next week include an Earth observation satellite to capture light invisible to the naked eye. It is the biggest single launch by India, trailing Russia’s 33 in 2014 and NASA’s 29 the year before. India last month successfully launched a scale model of a reusable spacecraft, a project that in time could pit the nation against Bezos and Musk in the race to make access to space cheaper and easier. The country also injected a probe into Mars’ atmosphere in 2014 for just $74 million, about 11 percent of the cost of the U.S.’s Maven probe.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft, Reasserting Its Muscle, Buys LinkedIn for $26.2 Billion:\\xa0\\xa0Microsoft has made its most ambitious move in years to reassert itself in a technology market it once dominated.\\xa0The software giant said Monday morning that it would acquire LinkedIn in a $26.2 billion cash deal. The acquisition, by far the largest in Microsoft’s history, unites two companies in different businesses: one a big maker of software tools, the other the largest business-oriented social networking site, with more than 400 million members globally.\\xa0The deal is Microsoft’s biggest bet yet that the traditional software business is shifting quickly to cloud computing, a model in which customers rent software and other services delivered over the internet. While LinkedIn does not have the household name of Facebook, a much larger and more lucrative social network, it is the most widely used site for people to advertise their professional skills and work history.Though they operate in different businesses, Microsoft and LinkedIn make most of their money by catering to professionals. Executives involved in the deal said that the common thread prompted the acquisition. “They know the interconnections of the business world,” said Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner, a technology research firm. “That could really benefit Microsoft from a sales standpoint.”\\n\\n\\nHow generous is Microsoft’s takeover bid?\\xa0It puts LinkedIn’s enterprise value at 79 times the social network’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, for the 12 months that ended on March 31.\\xa0On the basis of that multiple, the transaction is more expensive than any big internet deal paid with cash, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Microsoft is paying $220 for each of LinkedIn’s monthly active users. By comparison, when Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion two years ago, it spent $40 for every user.\\xa0For LinkedIn, the attractions of the deal are obvious: Its shares fell nearly 42 percent from the beginning of the year through last week, as investors expressed disappointment over a weak earnings forecast for 2016. Finding a buyer with deep pockets dulls the pain of being a publicly traded company.\\n\\n\\nOne Unspoken Reason Behind the LinkedIn Sale: “Let me explain why.”\\xa0Jeff Weiner, LinkedIn’s chief executive, wrote a lengthy memorandum to his employees Monday morning, ticking off a list of reasons behind the surprise decision to sell the company to Microsoft for $26.2 billion: Most important, he said, was the heft that Microsoft gives LinkedIn “to control our own destiny.”\\xa0But there may have been another reason that he left unspoken.\\xa0That would be the company’s struggling stock price and its reliance — some might say overreliance — on stock-based compensation.On one grim day in early February, LinkedIn’s stock price plummeted more than 40 percent after it forecast weaker-than-expected growth for the year. The share price had hovered at $225 at the beginning of 2016; a month later it briefly got close to $100.\\xa0The rapid devaluation has posed more than just a problem for investors. LinkedIn’s employees are paid largely in stock, and therein lies the rub: Around the company’s new 26-story skyscraper that opened in downtown San Francisco in March, as well as the corporate headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., there have been persistent whispers about whether LinkedIn could retain its top talent as the marketplace clobbered their incomes.Mr. Weiner — who took over as LinkedIn’s chief in 2009, succeeding Reid Hoffman, the founder — has done a tremendous job in the past years building the company’s business, which is primarily about helping people connect to one another for employment and conduct business-oriented social networking. But despite all the headlines about growth and profits, LinkedIn has been a money-losing operation for the last two years.\\xa0You wouldn’t know that if you only glanced at LinkedIn’s news releases. That’s because LinkedIn steers investors to focus on what’s known as its adjusted Ebitda, or non-GAAP earnings. The company purposely strips out the cost of stock-based compensation, which has the effect of turning losses into gains. LinkedIn paid out $510 million in stock-based compensation last year; over the last two years, that stock-based compensation represented a whopping 96 percent of operating income, or 16 percent of revenue, according to Mr. Mahaney. Companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook paid out about 15 percent of operating income, or well under 10 percent of revenue.\\n\\n\\n\\nBaidu Reduces Revenue Forecast on Ad Restrictions:\\xa0Baidu, China’s biggest internet search engine, cut its revenue forecast for the second quarter, saying regulatory restrictions cut advertising from drug companies and other health-care groups. Shares declined as much as 8.9 percent in extended trading after the announcement.\\xa0The company said it projects sales of 18.1 billion yuan ($2.81 billion) to 18.2 billion yuan compared with its previous forecast of 20.1 billion to 20.6 billion yuan.\\xa0The new regulations on online marketing by health-care companies have caused a reduction or delay in advertising “from a significant portion” of medical customers, Baidu said in a statement Monday. The company said the lower revenue also is a result of the cut in the number of sponsored links, which Baidu announced last month. While these actions will have a negative impact in the short term, Baidu said it expects users to become accustomed to the changes and health-care advertising will eventually recover. Last month, Baidu announced that it will restrict the number of sponsored posts to 30 percent of a results page, and establish a 1 billion yuan fund to fight fraud after the death of Wei Zexi, a 21-year-old computer science student who sought out a controversial treatment advertised among search results.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDoes the LinkedIn sale put Twitter in play? Yes, it does:\\xa0LinkedIn just gave Twitter investors something they haven’t felt in a long time: Hope.\\xa0News that LinkedIn sold to Microsoft on Monday for more than $26 billion has pushed Twitter stock up more than 8 percent in early-morning trading. The reason? If Microsoft is willing to break the bank for LinkedIn, maybe there’s a savior out there for Twitter, too!\\xa0There have long been talks that a big tech company like Google or Facebook or even Microsoft might swoop in for Twitter. Now that feels almost inevitable, especially given that Twitter’s stock is down nearly 60 percent from where it was a year ago when then-CEO Dick Costolo announced he was stepping down.\\xa0Simply put, that means the LinkedIn acquisition has done more to boost Twitter’s value than CEO Jack Dorsey has. Of course, the stock move is typical investor arbitrage, but if Twitter’s shares stay up, it\\'s a clear signal investors would rather see it in someone else’s hands.\\xa0Who might save Twitter? It could still be Google, or perhaps a bigger media player like Comcast*. We talk all the time with smart people close to Twitter, and the growing feeling is that Twitter’s best option is to finally sell to someone with deep pockets.\\xa0With LinkedIn now off the market, those deep pockets may come take a closer look.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Starts to Woo Its App Developers:\\xa0When Apple’s App Store opened in 2008, there were well under a thousand apps, and the relationship was obviously beneficial for both sides. But now, when there are more than 1.5 million apps fighting for attention in the App Store, the benefits for developers, particularly smaller ones, have become much less apparent.\\xa0“Is Apple coasting on its relationship and lead with developers? I think the answer is yes,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. “Their app store is considered an unappealing experience by many people. Their rules are arbitrary, and they take a big slice of money from sales.”\\xa0For a long time, Apple didn’t have to care. But now it faces flat sales of its flagship iPhones, a lack of excitement about newer products like its smart watch and Apple TV, growing competition from Google’s Android platform and the rise of new challengers like Amazon’s Echo device, which responds to a user’s voice commands at home with the kind of magic that used to be an Apple hallmark.\\xa0As the company prepares to hold its annual developer conference in San Francisco next week, there are signs that it wants to improve its relationship with app makers. Among the announcements expected at the gathering: Apple plans to finally give developers access to its Siri voice assistant so they can incorporate it into their apps.Apple’s charm offensive began in earnest in December, after it put Philip W. Schiller, its senior vice president of worldwide marketing, in charge of the App Store. Under Mr. Schiller, the company accelerated the app approval process, cutting typical review times from two weeks to a day or two.\\xa0On Wednesday, Apple announced that it would soon begin allowing app makers to buy ads that would appear at the top of search results in the App Store, like the ads already on Google’s Play Store and website.\\xa0Apple also said that it would cut its usual 30 percent commission on all subscriptions to 15 percent after an app subscriber had been active for at least a year.\\n\\n\\nWhat happens when your search engine is first to know you have cancer:This week researchers demonstrated that by analyzing a person’s Web searches they could in some cases predict an upcoming diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.\\xa0The team of researchers aren’t pancreatic cancers experts, but computer scientists at Microsoft. Unlike traditional medical professionals, they have the advantage of access to a trove of data that Microsoft collects through its search engine, Bing.\\xa0The Microsoft researchers identified Web users who had recently searched for queries indicating they have pancreatic cancer, such as “I was told I have pancreatic cancer, what to expect,” and then looked back months earlier to examine patterns in the symptoms that the users searched for. This included phrases such as “dark or tarry stool,” “abdominal swelling,” “dark urine” and “yellowing skin.”\\xa0From this analysis they realized trends in the queries of users who were soon to be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, identifying 5 to 15 percent of cases with low false-positive rates. The research was published in the Journal of Oncology Practice.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba Bears Pounce as SEC Probe, SoftBank Sale Squeeze Shares:Traders have never been more bearish on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the fast-growing Chinese e-commerce company facing a regulatory probe and the loss of a key investor.\\xa0The total number of outstanding shares borrowed for short selling peaked at more than 124 million last week. That’s the most since its 2014 initial public offering and is up from about 60 million in December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Markit.\\xa0Prominent short sellers including Jim Chanos and John Hempton have been red-flagging Alibaba for months, suggesting that its growth figures might be too good to be true. Bearish bets spiked in the past two weeks after the company disclosed a regulatoryprobe of its Chinese delivery unit and SoftBank Group Corp. disclosed plans to sell a $10 billion stake. Alibaba, which claimed more than 75 percent of the e-commerce market share in China last year, made history with a record $25 billion initial public offering in September 2014. Traders in New York clamored for the stock, which was priced at $68 a share, as a way to tap into the potential profits available from the country’s growing middle class.\\xa0The shares have dropped 6.4 percent to $75.92 since May 25 when the company said that the SEC is looking at data reported from the company’s Singles’ Day promotion, Alibaba’s biggest shopping day, and how the company consolidates results from affiliates, including logistics partner Cainiao Network.\\xa0While SoftBank’s divestment comes as part of a broader strategy to find new investments in startups and strengthen its debt-heavy balance sheet, the move can be unsettling to investors as the Japanese technology giant first bought into the company 16 years ago, said Henry Guo, a New York-based analyst at M Science.\\xa0“The stake sale by SoftBank caught the market off guard, which damped Alibaba shares as it’s one of the early investors,” Guo, who has been covering Chinese internet stocks traded in the U.S. for about 10 years and has a positive outlook on Alibaba, said by phone.\\n\\n\\nAmazon is preparing to launch streaming music service - sources:\\xa0Amazon.com Inc is preparing to launch a standalone music streaming subscription service, placing it squarely in competition with rival offerings from Apple Inc and Spotify, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.\\xa0The service will be offered at $9.99 per month, in line with major rivals, and it will offer a competitive catalog of songs, the sources said. Amazon (AMZN.O) is finalizing licenses with labels for the service, which likely will be launched in late summer or early fall, the sources said.\\xa0Amazon, which offers a free streaming music service with a limited catalog to subscribers of its Prime shipping and video service, did not respond to a request for comment about the new, full-fledged music plan.\\xa0Although it will be a late entrant to the crowded streaming space, Amazon believes a comprehensive music service is important to its bid to be a one-stop shop for content and goods, the sources said.\\xa0The new music offering also is intended to increase the appeal of the Amazon Echo, its home speaker, which searches the Internet and orders products from the retailer with voice commands.\\n\\n\\nWhy Line’s Two-Year Wait for IPO Cost It $4 Billion in Valuation:\\xa0Line Corp. has finally pulled the trigger on an initial public offering after a two-year hiatus. That period of hesitation may have cost the messaging service $4 billion in valuation as Facebook Inc. began encroaching on its turf and markets cooled on technology company debuts.\\xa0Japan’s leading mobile messaging service is aiming to raise as much as 113 billion yen ($1 billion) in July at a market value of roughly 588 billion yen, according to data in its Friday IPO filings. That’s down 40 percent from an estimated 1 trillion yen when it first filed for an offering in 2014. The price range will be set on June 27, and the final price July 11.\\xa0That may be as good as it gets. Line’s gearing up for a battle with far larger rivals like Facebook and China’s WeChat as it looks to expand its 218 million user base beyond its strongest markets of Japan, Taiwan and Thailand. The Tokyo-based company, owned by South Korean search portal Naver Corp., plans to use the proceeds to spearhead an expansion across Asia and, eventually, the U.S.\\xa0“Line will have its market in Japan fairly fortified from the likes of WhatsApp or even Facebook Messenger,” said Amir Anvarzadeh, manager of Japanese equity sales at BGC Partners Inc. “Outside of its core markets, it’s going to be a massive challenge.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThomas J. Perkins, Pioneering Venture Capitalist in Silicon Valley, Dies at 84:\\xa0Thomas J. Perkins, who nurtured Silicon Valley’s venture capital industry into a force that later helped foster the growth of companies like Google and Amazon, died Tuesday night at his home in Marin County, Calif. He was 84. Mr. Perkins co-founded the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 1972, at a time when parts of Silicon Valley were still fruit orchards. Mr. Perkins and his partners popularized a model of investment that involved putting small amounts of money into promising young start-ups in return for a stake in the companies, giving them advice and counsel to spur their growth.\\xa0Some of the investments turned into gigantic hits. Mr. Perkins had said that his favorite investment was Genentech, a biotechnology company that has since been acquired by Roche. Over time, Kleiner Perkins — and its home on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, Calif. — became a destination for other venture capitalists.\\xa0Mr. Perkins helped recruit venture capitalists like John Doerr to his firm, leading to investments in a new generation of technology companies, including Netscape, AOL, Amazon and later Google.\\xa0The firm’s success transformed Silicon Valley and the technology and biotechnology industries, leading to a proliferation of venture firms in the region and creating an ecosystem of investment in start-ups that today remains unrivaled in any other part of the world. Later in his life, Mr. Perkins was embroiled in several controversies. In 1996, he was convicted in France of involuntary manslaughter from a yacht collision. In another, he stepped down from the board of Hewlett-Packard in 2006 after he said the company had used illegal methods to obtain his phone records. The allegations led to the resignation of H.P.’s chairwoman and an overhaul of the board.\\xa0He also publicly broke with Kleiner Perkins in 2014 after writing an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal in which he compared the “progressive war on the American 1 percent” to the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany. The comments set off a firestorm, and the firm moved to distance itself from Mr. Perkins, who later apologized for his language.\\xa0David A. Kaplan, who wrote a biography of Mr. Perkins titled “Mine’s Bigger: The Extraordinary Tale of the World’s Greatest Sailboat and the Silicon Valley Tycoon Who Built It” (2007), said in an interview on Thursday that Mr. Perkins’s “legacy won’t be helped by all the excessive things he said in recent years and the grudges he nursed,” though he was a “seminal figure” for Silicon Valley.\\n\\n\\nAmazon confirms international expansion of its Fresh grocery delivery service:\\xa0Amazon announced an overseas expansion of its Amazon Fresh grocery delivery service on Thursday, starting with a rollout in certain neighborhoods in London. Recode reported two weeks ago that Amazon planned to expand to a variety of new markets this year, including the U.K. and Boston in the U.S., after an 18-month hiatus on new city launches.\\xa0The service will cost Londoners about $10 a month on top of their regular Amazon Prime membership, or about $120 a year. In the U.S., an Amazon Fresh membership costs about $200 on top of the normal $99 Prime membership program.\\xa0Orders of around $58 or more come with free delivery in London. Amazon delivers the groceries — which can include both packaged groceries as well as perishable items like meat and cheese — on the same day for morning orders, or the next day for late afternoon and evening orders.\\xa0Amazon Fresh launched nearly a decade ago, but has expanded slowly as the company has tried to figure out a business model that works. The service was previously only available in parts of Washington, California, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The online grocery market is still tiny in the U.S., but is more mature in the U.K. That means more competition for Amazon, but perhaps the opportunity to grow the business more quickly.\\n\\n\\nUber Feels UberPop Hangover With French, German Legal Setbacks:\\xa0Uber Technologies Inc. is feeling the sting of European judges from Paris to Frankfurt over UberPop, suffering setbacks in France and Germany months after it took the ride-sharing option out of its app there.\\xa0On Thursday, a French criminal court fined the company and two of its executives a total of 850,000 euros ($960,000), half of which was suspended, and a German appeals court separately said it wouldn’t overturn a ban of UberPop in the country. French prosecutors had attacked Uber for fraudulent commercial practices and encouraging illegal activity through UberPop, as well as improper use of personal data. “UberPop went on for months illegally, though the company and its executives knew very well what the applicable legal context was,” judge Cecile Louis-Loyant said in Paris. She fined Uber France 800,000 euros, the head of its French operations, Thibaud Simphal, 20,000 euros and Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, the company’s general manager for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, another 30,000 euros, saying they incited others to break the law by working for the service, leading to riots and taxistrikes in the French capital.\\xa0UberPop, which allows anyone with a vehicle and driver’s license to offer a cab-like service, stopped in July in France and was banned in Germany in March 2015. Meanwhile Uber’s main chauffeured-car service, that requires registration with authorities, is still going.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe app boom is over:\\xa0The mobile app boom kicked off in July 2008, when Apple introduced the App Store. Now it is over. \\xa0People are still making plenty of apps, of course. And many people are still downloading them. But the go-go growth days are gone.\\xa0If you are an independent app developer or publisher, you have probably known this for a while, because you have found it very difficult to get people to download your app — the average American smartphone user downloads zero apps per month.\\xa0But now even the very biggest app publishers are seeing their growth slow down or stop altogether. Most people have all the apps they want and/or need. They\\'re not looking for new ones.\\xa0Last month, the top 15 app publishers saw downloads drop an average of 20 percent in the U.S., according to research from Nomura, which relies on data from app tracker SensorTower. So you can still break through the saturated app market, if you are very very very lucky, and good. But the odds are stacked against you.\\n\\n\\nWhy everyone should worry about this scary glitch that affected rich drivers:\\xa0Carmaker Toyota and its luxury brand Lexus rushed to fix a software bug Wednesday that had caused a malfunction in vehicles’ GPS, climate control and “infotainment,” or front console radio systems. It disabled the backup camera and hands-free phone functions as well.\\xa0Errant data broadcast Tuesday by the company’s traffic and weather service confounded vehicles\\' \"Enform\" infotainment system installed in 2014, 2015 and 2016 Lexus vehicles and the 2016 Toyota Land Cruiser, the company said. The data made the subscription-based “Enform” system continuously reboot itself, rendering it unusable and drawing the ire and \\xa0of many a driver.\\xa0Lexus’s social media accounts were flooded with complaints through Wednesday morning and by 9 a.m., the company told customers to stand by for a momentary fix. Owners should force a reset of their vehicle’s computer by disconnecting its 12-volt battery for at least 5 minutes, the company said. Owners can also bring their vehicles to a Lexus dealer to reset their system.\\xa0The company halted the offending data stream overnight, but did not anticipate lingering problems in its vehicles. Lexus said it is still determining how many vehicles the bug impacted.\\xa0The same way smartphone or software companies remotely update their products, car companies are increasingly doing the same to fix operating system glitches and even update road maps and car-friendly mobile applications.\\xa0That’s because cars are increasingly becoming giant rolling computers, capable of doing an untold number of tasks while getting from Point A to Point B. Consider the“Enform” service, which includes smartphone and app connectivity, SiriusXM satellite radio, traffic and weather updates and Bluetooth connectivity.\\xa0A new car might have 100 million lines of code, according to a report by research and accounting firm Stout Risius Ross. The more luxurious the car, the more interconnected its technological components may be.\\n\\n\\nWhat to Do With Apple Cash? Irish Dilemma as EU Ruling Looms:\\xa0As Ireland braces itself for a possible European Union order to claw back Apple Inc.’s unpaid taxes, government officials warned Finance Minister Michael Noonan that he would face two crucial questions upon delivery of a ruling that could come “soon.”\\xa0The first is whether to appeal at the EU’s top court. The second, is what to do with the “large recovery amounts” pending the outcome. Ireland could be sitting on the cash for “several years,” according to a briefing note from last month published Wednesday.\\xa0Amid growing speculation that Apple could be forced to pay back billions of euros of tax breaks, officials said they are preparing for the worst and that an adverse ruling “could have significant negative implications for Ireland, in terms of reputation and the creation of uncertainty around our tax system.”\\n\\n\\nApple Pay competitor CurrentC is the disaster everyone thought it would be:\\xa0Sometimes you can judge a book by its cover.\\xa0When Walmart and other big retailers said in 2012 that they were creating a consortium called MCX to build a payments app, a lot of people laughed. The idea of a bunch of retailers collaborating effectively on a joint venture seemed far-fetched, let alone one where technology would play a critical role.\\xa0Then there was the motivation for the venture, which seemed shortsighted: Get customers to pay with anything but traditional credit cards, since they cost Walmart and other retailers higher transaction fees than other forms of payment.\\xa0There were plenty of other signs along the way spelling out trouble. Just a sampling: Customers who signed up for the app had their email addresses leaked in a hack in 2014, and the new CEO who arrived in 2015 said the launch likely wouldn\\'t happen until 2016.\\xa0In the meantime, some big MCX partners like Best Buy said they would start accepting Apple Pay. Finally, Walmart — perhaps MCX\\'s biggest initial backer — announced its own app, Walmart Pay. Some Walmart insiders were obviously tired of waiting for CurrentC to become a reality.Turns out there was good reason for these red flags. On Tuesday, the company notified beta users of its payments app, CurrentC, that the test was ending and their accounts were being deleted. This news followed MCX layoffs in May. It finally looks like game over for CurrentC.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Reviews? Researchers Give Them a Low Rating:\\xa0Reviews tell us what to read next, where to eat dinner and what to order there, where to go on vacation and what doctor to call. Soon, as Google demonstrated with the introduction of its voice-activated Google Home device in May, reviews will be read aloud to you as you lie on the couch, wondering what movie to see next.\\xa0But if reviews are ubiquitous, there are also persistent controversies over how many of the reviews on the internet were bought by the subject rather than written as finely reasoned opinions from a neutral party, and whether that distorts all results.But if reviews are ubiquitous, there are also persistent controversies over how many of the reviews on the internet were bought by the subject rather than written as finely reasoned opinions from a neutral party, and whether that distorts all results. In May, Yelp issued 59 new Consumer Alerts, which are notices it puts on a business’s page that it has been caught trying to pay for better reviews. Among those cited were a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon and an emergency room in Humble, Tex. Lifehacker.com recently took on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, arguing their way of compiling reviews was “fundamentally flawed.” FiveThirtyEight.com reported that “men are sabotaging the online reviews of TV shows aimed at women.” (Why? Because they can.)\\xa0Bart de Langhe, an assistant professor of marketing at Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado, used to see numerical reviews online and accept them implicitly. Then, when his son was born three years ago, he needed to buy a car seat. Mr. de Langhe noticed that the seat rated lowest by Consumer Reports got a high rating on Amazon, and the one rated highest by Consumer Reports received a low rating on Amazon.\\xa0The more popular seat on Amazon was also more expensive. Were reviewers, he wondered, paying more attention to things like price and brand than the objective, measurable ability of the seat to protect its occupant? With two other researchers, Philip Fernbach and Donald Lichtenstein, Mr. de Langhe began a study that compared online reviews for items like air-conditioners and car batteries with the evaluations in Consumer Reports.\\xa0“Navigating by the Stars” was published in April in The Journal of Consumer Research. After analyzing 344,157 Amazon ratings of 1,272 products in 120 product categories, the researchers found “a substantial disconnect” between the objective quality information that online reviews actually convey and the extent to which consumers trust them.\\xa0In other words, the consumer saw a number — 4.6 stars out of 5 — and took it much more seriously than it merited.\\xa0Nearly half the time, Amazon reviewers and the Consumer Reports experts disagreed about which item in a random pair was better. Moreover, average user ratings did not predict resale value in the used-product marketplace, another traditional indicator of quality.\\n\\n\\nAmazon to Invest Additional $3 Billion in India, CEO Bezos Says:\\xa0Amazon.com Inc. will invest $3 billion more to build its business in India, bringing the company’s total pledged investment in the country since 2014 to $5 billion as it chases growth outside the U.S.\\xa0Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive officer of the Seattle-based online retailer, announced the investment Tuesday at the U.S.-India Business Council’s Leadership Summit in Washington, where Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to executives from U.S. companies.\\xa0“We have already created some 45,000 jobs in India and continue to see huge potential in the Indian economy,” Bezos said in a statement from the council. “Our Amazon.in team is surpassing even our most ambitious planned milestones.” Amazon gets most of its international revenue from the U.K., Germany and Japan. The company doesn’t break out sales from India, instead including it in a group with other international markets. Revenue from that group in 2015 reached $7.4 billion, or 6.9 percent of total sales. Amazon has targeted India as an area ripe for growth, and has been spending to challenge local e-commerce company Flipkart. Bezos said at a conference last week that Amazon is doing most of the last-mile deliveries and opening more distribution centers in India.\\xa0Bezos also highlighted achievements in India in his annual letter to shareholders. They included the launch of Seller Flex, which uses Amazon sellers’ warehouses to store other products sold on Amazon, helping the company quickly expand its delivery capabilities. Amazon’s cloud computing division is also developing new infrastructure in India.\\n\\n\\nSovereign wealth funds throw funding lifeline to tech ventures:\\xa0A succession of funding deals by deep-pocketed sovereign wealth funds have thrown a life preserver to some of the world’s biggest private tech firms whose high valuations have come under scrutiny in the past year. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States along with state-backed investors in Singapore and China have ploughed money into hot tech investments such as ride-sharing company Uber \\xa0and Chinese Internet giant Alibaba and its private affiliates. With overall funding for start-ups slowing down by a third to $25.5 billion in the last two quarters, according to data from CB Insights, high-profile ventures are turning to government funds or institutional money to create \"private IPOs\" rather than to venture capitalists or chancing public listings. These capital injections have helped to keep valuations high as other tech ventures such as those of cloud storage service Dropbox or Indian takeaway food ordering app Zomato have been marked down by some earlier backers. Saudi Arabia\\'s Public Investment Fund said last week it invested $3.5 billion in Uber, Silicon Valley\\'s most highly valued private company. At $62.5 billion, the car-sharing firm is worth more than the stock market capitalizations of automakers BMW or GM and close to VW, Daimler and Ford.\\xa0Also last week, Singapore\\'s two big government investors bought $1 billion of Alibaba Group shares, while in April, China Investment Corp, took part in a $4.5 billion round in Alibaba\\'s financial services affiliate ANT Financial with other investors, marking the largest ever funding round in a fintech firm. Saudi Arabia\\'s $3.5 billion stake in Uber was the largest ever single private investment in a tech company while the Kuwait Investment Authority took the lead this year in a $165 million private equity funding for struggling U.S. wearable devices maker Jawbone, one of seven tech and healthcare ventures it has made in the last two years. Qatar Investment Authority invested in Uber and Indian ecommerce firm Flipkart in 2014. Norway’s $865-billion fund, the world’s largest sovereign wealth investor, is a major backer of publicly traded tech stocks such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), but it can only invest in an unlisted company in the final run up to a public offering.\\xa0Restrictions on private investments mean it passed on an offer from Facebook (FB.O) to invest several years ago.\\n\\n\\nThe unsexiest trillion-dollar startup:\\xa0Steve Jobs went ballistic when public shipping manifests leaked the existence of the iPhone 3G. That’s about the only time something exciting happened in the freight forwarding business. The circulatory system of the global economy is a trillion-dollar industry, yet no one really talks about it, or builds tech for it.\\xa0That’s what makes freight such a massive disruption opportunity for a startup likeFlexport. \\xa0Transparency begets data, which begets efficiency. Smarter shipping shrinks the physical world the way faster internet shrinks the digital one. New businesses emerge. High bandwidth connections paved the way for Netflix. Now Flexport could make meatspace merchants as nimble as Amazon.\\xa0With $26.9 million in funding, Flexport grew the volume of goods it ships by 16X this year. Y Combinator president Paul Graham says “Flexport is one of that small handful of startups that are going to change the world.” Freight might finally be getting the weight of attention it deserves. Stick with me. Anything weighing over 150 kilos can’t be sent like a parcel through the postal service. It qualifies as freight, and can require several separately owned vehicles to deliver it across land, sea, or air from its source like a factory to a destination like a retail store. To get the best deal on each leg of the journey and handle the hand-offs through customs, freight forwarding services serve as an organizational logistics layer. They have direct relationships with carriers like truck owners and massive shipping container boats.\\xa0But like I said, it’s an unsexy business, so until recently, freight forwarding was still being done with a jumble of Excel, email, fax, and paper manifests shipped around the world. That made it extremely tough to spot overspending or snags in supply chains.\\xa0That is, until Flexport indexed all the available carriers into a searchable database in its free software for organizing and tracking shipments. In 2016 it’s moved freight to or from 64 countries for over 700 clients like Ring and Le Tote, with a $1.5 billion annual run-rate of merchandise value shipped. There’s 2.4 million toys and 412,000 pieces of glassware currently in transit on the Flexport platform. Its investors include First Round, Founders Fund, Felicis, GV (Google Ventures), Box Group, Bloomberg Beta, and Ashton Kutcher.\\xa0That’s quite an ascent considering Petersen admits “I didn’t learn what the term ‘freight forwarder’ meant until a year into starting the business.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber Rolls Out App Improvements to Meet Driver Demands:\\xa0Tensions have long simmered between Uber and its drivers who power the ride-hailing service. Drivers held protests when Uber cut fares with little warning and have filed class-action lawsuits to be recognized as company employees rather than independent contractors.\\xa0Uber is now trying to improve the experience of its drivers.\\xa0On Monday, the company announced a host of software improvements to its app to address driver demands. Among the changes, drivers can now more easily pause ride requests, making it easier for them to take bathroom breaks and fill their gas tanks. Drivers can now also be paid instantly for each ride they complete, rather than weekly, and see on the app’s dashboard how much they have earned.Among the many changes for drivers that Uber announced on Monday was a partnership with companies that can give tax advice to drivers. Uber said drivers could now also receive discounts on Uber rides, auto maintenance and cellphone data plans.\\xa0In addition, Uber created a fuel finder function in the app that shows drivers the cheapest places nearby to fill up the gas tank, with the aim that Uber can someday negotiate with filling stations to provide discounts to Uber drivers.\\xa0And the Uber app will automatically start a ride two minutes after arriving at a rider’s location so that drivers are paid if they have to wait for passengers. Tardy passengers are a frequent complaint on driver blogs.Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg\\nLine Plans Year’s Biggest Tech IPO, Pitching U.S. Investors:\\xa0\\nJapan’s Line Corp. is headed for what could be the biggest initial public offering for a technology company this year, including a major pitch to American investors.\\xa0The company behind one of Asia’s most popular messaging apps plans to go public in Tokyo and New York in mid-to-late July, with a goal of raising between $1 billion and $2 billion at a valuation of $5 billion to $6 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The Tokyo-based company aims to get about half the money from U.S. investors as it plots a long-term expansion there after pushing further into Southeast Asia, said the people, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Line is already profitable and it will make that a focus for investors when it begins a roadshow toward the end of this month, according to one of the people.\\xa0If it reaches its goals, Line would be this year’s biggest tech offering globally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, providing a rare bright spot for the moribund market for listings. No business has raised more than $150 million in a technology IPO in 2016, even though more than 160 private companies are currently valued at $1 billion or more.\\xa0The market debut would come two years after Line filed an application to list in Tokyo in July 2014. That offering valued the company at 1 trillion yen ($9.2 billion), people familiar with the situation said at the time. A deal didn’t materialize and the company, controlled by South Korea’s Naver Corp., later replaced its chief executive officer. Naver shares, which aren’t trading on Monday due to a national holiday, are up 7.4 percent this year.The lower valuation for next month’s expected listing reflects the company’s slowing user growth and a cooling in technology valuations and listings. Global tech companies raised about $900 million in the first quarter of this year, down from $6.5 billion during same period in 2014 and $2.8 billion in the first quarter of last year, according to Ernst & Young LLP. This year’s biggest tech listing is Australia’s WiseTech Global Ltd., a logistics software company that raised about $130 million in April, according to Bloomberg data.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT-Mobile is giving every customer a share of its stock:\\xa0T-Mobile had another of its un-carrier events today, which now have so many regular giveaways they are starting to look like an episode of Oprah.\\xa0First, the company announced that every current T-Mobile account holder on a postpaid plan will get one share of common stock in the company, which is currently worth about $43. New qualifying customers will also get one share once they sign up with T-Mobile.\\xa0Plus, existing customers will be able to earn another free share (or two if you’ve been a customer for over five years) for each new customer they refer to the company — maxing out at 100 shares a year.\\xa0The prospectus for the offering is here, and gives a little more color on how exactly the promotion will work.\\xa0Once a customer redeems the share via T-Mobile’s new app, the security will be held in a brokerage account at LOYAL3 Securities. Stockholders can then hold on to their new investment, sell their shares via the platform or transfer their shares to another brokerage account. Customers can even electronically participate in proxy votes to vote their shares. Notably, instead of issuing additional shares, T-Mobile says shares needed to meet the needs of the program will be purchased on the open markets.\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook founder Zuckerberg\\'s social media accounts restored after alleged hack:\\xa0Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg\\'s Twitter and Pinterest accounts have been resecured, a spokesman from the social media platform said on Monday, responding to questions about weekend media reports that the founder\\'s sites had been hacked.\\xa0Zuckerberg\\'s Twitter and Pinterest accounts were compromised over the weekend, according to a report on Sunday from technology news website VentureBeat.\\xa0Those accounts have since been \"re-secured using best practices,\" a Facebook spokesman told Reuters, adding, \"no Facebook systems or accounts were accessed.\"\\xa0Zuckerberg\\'s Twitter account, @finkd, last used in January 2012, posted a tweet on Sunday with the message, \"Hey, @finkd You were in LinkedIn Datatbase with the password \\'dadada\\' ! DM (direct message) for proof,\" according to a screenshot posted to Twitter by Ben Hall (@Ben_Hall), founder of Katacoda, an interactive learning platform for software developers.\\xa0The tweet appeared to ask Zuckerberg to contact the sender, who claimed to have accessed his account.\\xa0Zuckerberg\\'s Pinterest page, meanwhile, was defaced with the headline \"Hacked By OurMine Team\" according to a screengrab of the page posted by VentureBeat.\\xa0\"Hey , we are just testing your security ,please dm (direct message) us for contact! twitter:twitter.com/_OurMine_,\" the compromised page said in a message that seemingly identified the hackers as being associated with the linked Twitter account.\\xa0The Twitter page associated with that account, @_OurMine_, has since been suspended.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

The cutbacks come just three months after the New York company said it raised a round of $430 million led by Chinese investors.\\xa0Managers were instructed to begin dismissals this week, said one of the e-mails. The startup, which lets members rent desks in an open office, ballooned from about 230 employees early last year to more than 1,000 today, according to research firm Mattermark.\\xa0WeWork said it hired 175 people in May and expects to add about 500 employees by the end of the year. The company said it expects to lift the pause on hiring as soon as next week. The funding round in March valued WeWork at $16 billion with a focus on financing expansion throughout Asia, people familiar with the matter said at the time. WeWork\\'s valuation is more than those of major landlords such as SL Green Realty Corp., which has a market value of $10.6 billion. Boston Properties Inc., the largest U.S. publicly traded office landlord, is valued at $19.6 billion.\\n\\n\\nNest CEO Tony Fadell is out:\\xa0Tony Fadell, the CEO and co-founder of Nest, is leaving the company two years after his connected device firm was acquired by Google.\\xa0Fadell announced his departure in a tweet on Friday, capping off a rocky tenure under the search giant, which reorganized itself as Alphabet in August and placed Fadell at the helm of his independent company. Marwan Fawaz, a former Motorola executive and adviser to the home security company ADT, is joining as Nest CEO.\\xa0The move comes after a series of public dramas and critical departures at Nest, which has failed to meet initial expectations since Google acquired it for over $3 billion two years ago. As we reported, Nest brought in around $340 million in revenue last year — short of the goals set before the company acquired the videocamera startup Dropcam.\\xa0That acquisition, by all measures, went terribly: Most of the Dropcam team departed, largely due to the frustrations of working under Fadell. Dropcam CEO Greg Duffy voiced those frustrations very publicly, writing that he regretted selling his company to Nest and Google.\\xa0Fadell will stay on as an adviser to Larry Page, CEO of Google parent Alphabet, the company said in a statement.\\xa0Several sources have said that a major issue for Nest was the integration of corporate cultures. Fadell, a former Apple executive, brought several others from that company and tried to retain Apple\\'s unique, tenacious culture. That often clashed with Google\\'s more open, experimental ethos, a fact that many Googlers noted often in many forums.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSnapchat Passes Twitter in Daily Usage:\\xa0Snapchat has 150 million people using the service each day, said people familiar with the matter. That makes the four-year-old messaging app more popular than Twitter Inc. by daily active users.\\xa0Snapchat has been growing quickly, boosted by its popularity among young people. The app had 110 million daily users in December, said the people, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak about the numbers.\\xa0Twitter, which was founded in 2006, has less than 140 million users interacting with the service daily, according to an average of analysts’ estimates surveyed by Bloomberg. The short-messaging service was once the largest social network after Facebook Inc. but has since been surpassed by Facebook’s other apps, including Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp.\\xa0Twitter has 310 million monthly active users, according to its most recent earnings report. The company doesn’t disclose how many of those people check in daily, but in the third quarter, it said about 44 percent of monthly users are active each day in the service’s top 20 markets. Twitter Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto said at the time that the percentage had been stable but that “we’ll be sure to disclose” if there was a significant change. The company hasn’t given an update since then. This implies a daily active user count of 136 million.\\xa0Snapchat has made communicating more of a game by letting people send annotated selfies and short videos. It has allowed people to use its imaging software to swap faces in a photo, transform themselves into puppies, and barf rainbows. (In March, Facebook said it acquired the startup behind an app called Masquerade, which offers similar photo-manipulation tools.) Snapchat encourages people to visit the app frequently with features such as the \"Snapstreak,\" which counts the number of consecutive days they’ve been communicating with their closest friends. Snapchat’s other content, such as news and Live Stories, disappear after 24 hours.\\n\\n\\nThe incredibly brilliant way people are now paying for things in Asia:\\xa0When Apple first rolled out Apple Pay in 2014, it was billed as a simpler way to buy goods and services. You take your phone out, tap it to the credit card reader, and off you go. Seems convenient, right? \\xa0But some consumers in Asia think there\\'s an even better way to pay.\\xa0In recent years, millions of people have grown accustomed to using messaging apps to communicate. Some of these apps now support person-to-person digital cash transfers. So the next step is pretty logical: Asian retailers have begun using these same messaging platforms to sell everything from clothing to hamburgers to train tickets. And as a consumer, you never have to leave the app to pay.\\xa0On the surface, this alternative sounds a lot like Apple Pay (or Samsung Pay, or Android Pay, etc.). But conducting real-life and online transactions through messaging apps stands to change retail like none of these other services have. What we\\'re seeing in Asia is the rise of mobile payments that run primarily on software, not hardware as we\\'ve tried to implement here in the United States. And that simple distinction may be the key to everything from accelerating the spread of mobile payments to unlocking deep, digital interactions with customers in brick-and-mortar stores to democratizing e-commerce away from giant online businesses like Amazon.To buy a meal with WeChat, which in China goes by the name Weixin, customers simply pull up a QR code in the app that\\'s connected to their credit card or other financial account. Once the cashier scans the code, that\\'s it — no further action is needed. Retailers in China will typically offerdiscounts to WeChat users as an incentive to pay with the app.\\n\\n\\nNo Uber IPO in Sight After $3.5 Billion From Saudi Arabia:\\xa0Once upon a time, Silicon Valley startups raised money from venture capitalists and then, with some luck and a promising business, held an IPO to cash in and expand. Uber has no need for such traditions.\\xa0The San Francisco-based company, founded in 2009 and valued at $62.5 billion, has now raised $11 billion as it spends heavily to expand globally and battle well-funded rivals such as Lyft Inc. and China’s Didi.\\xa0The ride-hailing company’s latest infusion of cash -- a record $3.5 billion from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund -- means Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick has the finances to continue avoiding a listing of his company any time soon. \"I’m going to make sure it happens as late as possible,\" he told CNBC earlier this year. The money from Saudi Arabia is a new wrinkle in the shifting way the world’s largest technology startups are being funded. The $3.5 billion raised by Uber Technologies Inc. this week is far larger than what most companies are able raise when they hold public offerings: Twitter Inc. netted $1.82 billion during its 2013 IPO and First Data Corp. raised $2.56 billion in the largest technology IPO of the past 12 months. In 2004, Google raised $1.67 billion during its stock-market debut.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber Turns to Saudi Arabia for $3.5 Billion Cash Infusion:\\xa0In its quest to build a global empire, Uber has turned to the Middle East for its biggest infusion of cash from a single investor.\\xa0Uber said on Wednesday that it had raised $3.5 billion from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, the kingdom’s main investment fund. The money was part of the ride-hailing giant’s most recent financing round and continued to value the company at $62.5 billion. The investment does not cash out any of Uber’s existing investors.Uber, which has viewed the Middle East as an important area in its expansion, said the investment further aligned the company with Saudi Arabia as the kingdom planned to transform its economy, reducing its dependence on oil and improving employment.\\xa0The investment from Saudi Arabia is one of the biggest single investments collected by the technology world’s top privately held companies. Uber, whose valuation makes it Silicon Valley’s most valuable private business, has collected billions at a rapid clip over the last three years.\\xa0Uber has drawn from a wide variety of investors, including traditional venture capital firms, mutual fund giants like BlackRock and wealthy clients of firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Other sovereign wealth funds like that of Qatar have also invested. Other smaller tech companies have not fared as well in raising money over the last several months. Some so-called unicorns, the term used to refer to businesses valued at more than $1 billion, have struggled to collect new investments, and some, like Jawbone, have had to raise money at lower valuations.\\xa0Uber is racing to defend its territory — which covers 460 cities in more than 69 countries — against incumbents in other regions like Southeast Asia and Europe. China, in particular, is a difficult battleground, as Uber is spending millions in a subsidy war with Didi Chuxing, the dominant ride-hailing start-up in the country. Both companies have made no indications that they will back down.\\xa0Though Uber dominates the American market for ride-hailing, it has increasingly seen overseas markets as crucial to its growth.\\xa0Among Uber’s increasingly important overseas markets is the Middle East, where the company has already said it plans to invest $250 million. The service operates in 15 cities and nine countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia.\\n\\n\\nNo Venture Capital Needed, or Wanted:\\xa0The business world is filled with starry-eyed entrepreneurs who hope that the blessings of angel investors and venture capitalists will transform their start-up dreams into companies with billion-dollar valuations.\\xa0But some successful start-ups have been bucking the trend by growing and expanding without taking a dime from major outside equity investors.Those who buck the odds by “bootstrapping” their own enterprises are rare, experts say.\\xa0“It’s a huge anomaly,” said Mark Walsh, head of innovation and investment at the Small Business Administration He estimated that as few as one in 50 brick-and-mortar companies and one in 10 online companies could build their businesses into $50 million or $100 million enterprises on their own.\\xa0But taking venture capital can be risky. In their haste to get financing, start-up founders often fail to read the fine print and later discover that they have signed away huge shares of the profits. In some cases, founders may be removed by the board of their own companies by the time the businesses are rapidly growing or plan to go public. For these reasons, some founders opt to take debt capital from banks and investors instead of giving away equity.\\n\\n\\nInternet Boom Times Are Over, Says Mary Meeker’s Influential Report:\\xa0Global internet and smartphone user growth are slowing dramatically, but at least things are looking up in India. \\xa0Growth of internet users worldwide is essentially flat, and smartphone growth is slowing, too. Those sobering insights were among the hundreds packed into the much-awaited Internet Trends report, an annual tech industry ritual led by Mary Meeker, a general partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Developing countries have proven harder to capture than expected because internet access remains inaccessible or unaffordable for many, the report said. Here are some other highlights from the report: India is the one country where internet usage is growing, up 40 percent compared with 33 percent a year ago. India passed the U.S. to become the No. 2 global market behind China in 2015. The Asia Pacific region represented 52 percent of smartphone users globally in 2015. The rapid growth in recent years has begun to slow, dropping to 23 percent in 2015 from 35 percent in 2014.\\xa0North America, Europe, and Japan represented 63 percent of global GDP in 1985. By 2015, their contribution dropped to 29 percent. China and emerging markets in Asia represented 63 percent of global GDP last year. Online advertising is still not very effective. Advertisers are spending an outsize amount on legacy media. Global birth rates are down 39 percent since 1960. So where will technology growth come from? Who knows, but at least there\\'s this: Global life expectancy is up 36 percent since 1960.\\n\\n\\nElizabeth Holmes, Founder of Theranos, Falls From Highest Perch Off Forbes List:\\xa0Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the blood testing company Theranos, was a rare breed, something more rare than even the Silicon Valley unicorn she created: a self-made female billionaire. Forbes, the business publication that has made a franchise of cataloging the rich, had put Ms. Holmes on the top of its list last year of America’s richest self-made women.The magazine’s new estimated tally of her wealth? It went from $4.5 billion to $0.\\xa0Ms. Holmes’s unusual status, as a young woman who created and controlled a company seemingly valued at about $9 billion, captivated the media: She graced countless magazine covers, including T: The New York Times Style Magazine. Theranos, she said, would revolutionize the lab industry by offering blood tests from a single finger prick at a fraction of the cost of traditional testing.\\xa0But over the last year, Theranos became the subject of a series of hard-hitting Wall Street Journal articles and intense regulatory scrutiny from an array of federal agencies.\\xa0The media is now mesmerized by Ms. Holmes’s fall. Truth be told, the half of the $9 billion valuation ascribed to Theranos and previously listed as Ms. Holmes’s wealth was nothing more than an estimate based on investors’ best guesses. Taking into account all the controversy and uncertainty surrounding the value of the company’s top-secret technology, Forbes is now guessing that the company is worth more like $800 million. While Ms. Holmes still owns at least half of the company, much of that value would be tied up with outside investors.Not surprisingly, Theranos refused to shed any light on the matter, except to dispute Forbes’s analysis.\\n\\n\\nEarly days, but Apple Pay struggles outside U.S.:\\xa0More than 18 months after Apple Pay took the United States by storm, the smartphone giant has made only a small dent in the global payments market, snagged by technical challenges, low consumer take-up and resistance from banks.\\xa0The service is available in six countries and among a limited range of banks, though in recent weeks Apple has added four banks to its sole Singapore partner American Express; Australia and New Zealand Banking Group in Australia; and Canada\\'s five big banks.\\xa0Apple Pay usage totaled $10.9 billion last year, the vast majority of that in the United States. That is less than the annual volume of transactions in Kenya, a mobile payments pioneer, according to research firm Timetric. And its global turnover is a drop in the bucket in China, where Internet giants Alibaba and Tencent dominate the world\\'s biggest mobile payments market - with an estimated $1 trillion worth of mobile transactions last year, according to iResearch data.\\xa0Anecdotal evidence from Britain, China and Australia suggests Apple Pay is popular with core Apple followers, but the quality of service, and interest in it, varies significantly.\\xa0To use Apple Pay, consumers tap their iPhone over payment terminals to buy coffee, train tickets and other services. It can be also used at vending machines that accept contactless payments.\\xa0Apple Pay transactions were a fraction of the $84.5 billion in iPhone sales for the six months to March, which accounted for two-thirds of Apple\\'s total revenue.\\n\\n\\n\\nSingapore buys $1 billion in Alibaba stock in SoftBank sale:\\xa0Singapore sovereign wealth funds bought $1 billion of Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\\'s shares as part of an $8.9 billion sale by Japan\\'s SoftBank Group Corp, Alibaba\\'s biggest shareholder, the company said on Wednesday.\\xa0Singapore\\'s GIC Private, Ltd and Temasek Holdings each purchased $500 million of Alibaba shares at $74.00 apiece through subsidiaries, Alibaba said, offering details of the SoftBank sale announced on Tuesday.\\xa0Alibaba purchased $2 billion of its own stock at the same price, in a move which would add to earnings, Executive Vice Chairman Joe Tsai told analysts on a call.\\xa0Members of the Alibaba Partnership of senior executives and founders purchased another $400 million, as expected, at the $74 per share price, he added.\\xa0SoftBank also offered $5.5 billion in debt securities, which can be exchanged for Alibaba stock in three years, Tsai said.\\xa0SoftBank Group said on Tuesday it would sell at least $7.9 billion of shares in Alibaba to cut the Japanese company\\'s debt. It said it would remain Alibaba\\'s largest shareholder after the sale.\\xa0Shares of Alibaba fell about 6.5 percent to close at $76.69.\\n\\n\\nSalesforce takes aim at e-commerce with $2.8 billion Demandware buy:\\xa0Cloud-based software maker Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N) said on Wednesday it would buy Demandware Inc (DWRE.N), whose software is used by businesses to run e-commerce websites, for about $2.8 billion.\\xa0The deal would help Salesforce open a new front as it seeks to take more market share from traditional software providers such as Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) and SAP AG (SAPG.DE), both of which already offer cloud-based e-commerce services.\\xa0The e-commerce market has been growing at a blistering pace as retailers expand their online presence, boosting demand for software that helps manage functions such as payment processing and inventory management.\\xa0Salesforce\\'s cash offer of $75.00 per share represents a 56.3 percent premium to Demandware\\'s Tuesday closing.\\xa0The lofty premium indicates that multiple bidders were likely at the table for Demandware, Stifel Nicolaus & Co analyst Thomas Roderick said, naming Adobe Systems Inc ABDE.O and Oracle as the other possible contenders. Demandware\\'s shares, which have fallen about 21 percent in the past year, rose 55.9 percent to $74.81 on Wednesday. Shares of Salesforce, considered a barometer for the cloud-computing industry, edged down 0.3 percent.\\n\\n\\nAmazon sues sellers for buying fake reviews:\\xa0Seller beware — if you buy reviews for your products on Amazon, the company might sue you.\\xa0As part of its effort to combat fake reviews on its platform, Amazon sued three of its sellers today for using sock puppet accounts to post fake reviews about their products. Amazon has been aggressively pursuing reviewers it does not consider genuine over the last year, often using lawsuits to discourage the buying and selling of reviews, but this is the first time it has sued the sellers themselves.\\xa0Today’s suits are against sellers who Amazon claims used fake accounts to leave positive reviews on their own products. The fake reviews spanned from 30 to 45 percent of the sellers’ total reviews. The defendants are Michael Abbara of California, Kurt Bauer of Pennsylvania, and a Chinese company called CCBetter Direct.\\xa0Amazon is asking for the defendants to be banned from selling products on any of its sites or accessing its services. The suits also ask for the profits the sellers made on Amazon, attorneys’ fees, and damages exceeding $25,000.\\xa0Amazon says that, since early 2015, it has sued over 1,000 people who posted fake reviews for cash. Now, the company is going after the retailers themselves. Amazon said that it intends to eliminate incentives for sellers to buy fake reviews for their products.\\xa0“Our goal is to eliminate the incentives for sellers to engage in review abuse and shut down this ecosystem around fraudulent reviews in exchange for compensation,” an Amazon spokesperson said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy you should delete the online accounts you don’t use anymore — right now:\\xa0Despite falling out of vogue years ago, MySpace — that old precursor to Facebook — still has details on more user accounts than the United States has people. And now a hefty chunk of those account credentials has been leaked to the entire Internet, in a humbling reminder that the Matchbox Twenty-inspired username you probably made in high school is still worth a heck of a lot to companies and criminals.\\xa0As many as 360 million MySpace accounts turned up for sale Friday in a 33-gigabyte dump online, according to reports that were confirmed Monday by MySpace\\'s parent, Time Inc.\\xa0The massive leak includes passwords, email addresses and usernames that were swiped from MySpace in a hack dating back to June 2013, before MySpace made a site redesign that closed some security gaps. It\\'s unclear how many of the accounts in the MySpace hack were still \"active,\" in the sense that they belong to people who continue to log into the service today. But chances are at least some of these accounts hadn\\'t been touched for years. The reason this makes you vulnerable is the same reason experts say you shouldn\\'t use the same username and password for every online service — it makes it easy to take one set of stolen credentials and plug them into others, giving hackers potential access to large swaths of your digital life. Personal data from the MySpace breach was going for sale to the tune of thousands of dollars, highlighting how even outdated information can still carry significant value. But whether your old data gets used for marketing, fraud or some other nefarious purpose is still at least partly within your control.\\n\\n\\nInside Uber’s Auto-Lease Machine, Where Almost Anyone Can Get a Car:\\xa0In its relentless pursuit for growth, Uber needs new drivers, and many of those drivers need cars. To help them get started, Uber has been offering short-term leases since July through a wholly owned Delaware-based subsidiary called Xchange Leasing, LLC. It partners with auto dealerships, advertises to drivers, manages risk, and even pays repo men to chase down cars whose drivers aren\\'t making their payments. Xchange may be key to Uber\\'s continued expansion as it tangles with Lyft in the U.S. and a bevy of competitors abroad. Uber announced a partnership with Toyota last week to finance even more cars. This year, Uber said its financing and discount programs, which include Xchange, will put more than 100,000 drivers on the road. That requires dipping into the vast pool of people with bad or no credit.\\xa0In a deal led by Goldman Sachs, Xchange received a $1 billion credit facility to fund new car leases, according to a person familiar with the matter. The deal will help Uber grow its U.S. subprime auto leasing business and it will give many of the world\\'s biggest financial institutions exposure to the company\\'s auto leases. \\xa0The credit facility is basically a line of credit that Xchange can use to lease out cars to Uber drivers.\\n\\n\\nInstagram Adds Business Profiles in Advertising Growth Push:\\xa0Facebook’s photo-sharing application Instagram is unveiling tools to help businesses differentiate themselves from regular users in a bid to help drive advertising revenue.\\xa0Instagram, which has been heralded by analysts as a key source of growth for Facebook, will now let businesses create special profiles that will allow customers to contact them directly rather than posting public comments. Instagram will also offer business users new data on which posts are getting the most engagement and give them the ability to turn posts into advertisements. Facebook is working to leverage Instagram’s 400 million monthly users to keep up its pace of revenue growth. Instagram ads are expected to bring in $1.53 billion in revenue in 2016, or 15 percent of Facebook’s total ad sales, according to eMarketer. Instagram has 8.5 million users in Canada, Levine said.\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft sells patents to Xiaomi, builds \\'long-term partnership\\':\\xa0Software maker Microsoft \\xa0is selling about 1,500 of its patents to Chinese device maker Xiaomi [XTC.UL], a rare departure for the U.S. company and part of what the two companies say is the start of a long-term partnership.\\xa0The deal, announced on Wednesday, also includes a patent cross-licensing arrangement and a commitment by Xiaomi to install copies of Microsoft software, including Office and Skype, on its phones and tablets.\\xa0Both companies declined to discuss financial terms of the deal. \\xa0Jonathan Tinter, corporate vice president at Microsoft, said the company was keen to tap into Xiaomi\\'s young, affluent and educated users by having its products pre-installed on their devices. He declined to go into detail about the patent deals, but said the overall deal was something \"we do only with a few strategic partners.\"\\xa0Microsoft has cut licensing deals with many Android device makers over the years, but has had less luck with Chinese manufacturers.\\xa0Florian Mueller, a patents expert who consulted for Microsoft in the past, said it was rare for Microsoft to actually sell its patents, adding \"it\\'s possible Microsoft found it easier to impose its Android patent tax on Xiaomi as part of a broader deal that also involved a transfer of patents.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe military’s stealth motorcycles are as quiet as an electric toothbrush:\\xa0The military is funding stealth motorcycles, which would allow riders to quickly sneak up on unsuspecting enemies.\\xa0The motorcycles operate at 55 decibels — about the level of an electric toothbrush or typical conversation — yet still can reach 80 mph in speed. The extreme quiet is due to the use of electric motors.\\xa0The motorcycles also feature two-wheel drive to improve traction on gravel, sand or any challenging terrain. The narrow dimensions of the motorcycles allow them to be driven in forests or other places some military vehicles can’t go.The electric motors have limited range — the SilentHawk lasts two hours and the other bike, NightMare, has 60 miles of power. So the motorcycles are modified with hybrid engines that can burn almost any type of fuel, such as gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene or diesel. The thinking is these hybrid engines, which are about as loud as a vacuum cleaner, can be used on the part of a mission where being quiet isn’t essential. Using the back-up engine increases the SilentHawk’s range to 170 miles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVR Experience From McDonald\\'s Lets You Watch Life-Size Angry Birds Take Over a Restaurant:\\xa0McDonald\\'s ald\\'s has partnered with Sony and Rovio, the creator of Angry Birds, to create a 360-degree video promoting the upcoming feature film The Angry Birds Movie. The 60-second spot puts the viewer in the center of a McDonald\\'s restaurant, as the film\\'s feathered flying stars zip in the air from table to table, dance in the aisles and take selfies with dining families.\\xa0The film was created in partnership with DDB Chicago and has racked up more than 4.5 million views in less than a week. According to John Maxham, chief creative officer at DDB Chicago, it\\'s the first 360-degree video for McDonald\\'s (unless you count the VR Happy Meal painting activation during SXSW). Maxham said it\\'s also the first time a 360-degree film has been shot for any quick service restaurant.\\xa0To combine animation with reality, DDB Chicago worked with Rovio for the animations using pre-existing bird assets and with Optimist to stitch everything together. According to Shelby Georgis, DDB\\'s creative director, the trick was choreographing animations ahead of time so that the actors were set to work on a specific cadence that makes it look like they\\'re interacting with the animals.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChina to open e-commerce, other sectors to foreign investment:\\xa0newspaper: China will lift restrictions to investments by foreign firms in a range of service industry sectors, including e-commerce, logistics, accounting and auditing, the China Securities News quoted commerce minister Gao Hucheng as saying.\\xa0Gao said China would also promote the orderly opening of other service fields including finance, education, culture and health care, the report published on Saturday said without elaborating or giving a time-frame.\\xa0China\\'s trade in services would exceed $1 trillion by 2020, the minister predicted. The Ministry of Commerce has previously said the value of China\\'s services trade was expected to exceed $750 billion this year.\\n\\n\\nThiel-Gawker Fight Raises Concerns About Press Freedom:\\xa0The story of Gawker versus Hulk Hogan — or, perhaps more accurately, Peter Thiel — has some asking whether press freedom in the United States is in peril if a scorned billionaire can help deliver a crippling blow to a media company.\\xa0But since Mr. Thiel spoke to The New York Times on Wednesday about his reasons for funding the lawsuit against Gawker, the debate surrounding the dispute has expanded to encompass ideological battles in media, technology and politics.\\xa0A variety of observers, including other billionaires and figures involved in GamerGate, have entered into the fray to address themes like Mr. Thiel’s political motivations, and the wider issue of Silicon Valley power players and their involvement with the news media. Several journalists felt that Mr. Thiel’s political views and connection withDonald J. Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner, could be worrisome based on Mr. Trump’s previous comments about changing libel laws to make it easier to sue media outlets.\\n\\n\\nTwitter\\'s retreat from \\'Buy\\' buttons puts its payments partner Stripe in an awkward spot:\\xa0In September, payments startup Stripe trumpeted a new product that would allow retailers to sell goods directly in social networking and content apps. The biggest partner app Stripe launched with was Twitter, whose \\'Buy\\' buttons allowed users to buy items directly from a tweet. But just a month later, Twitter disbanded the team working on \\'Buy\\' buttons, as Recode reported on Thursday, and shifted its focus on commerce to other initiatives. The \\'Buy\\' button technology still exists, and retailers can still use Stripe\\'s new product, Relay, to sell products on Twitter. But the perception that Stripe\\'s biggest partner no longer considers it a priority doesn\\'t look good. You could imagine the challenge convincing potential retail partners that they should invest in a program whose biggest platform partner no longer appears to be interested. The idea behind Relay is that people will increasingly want to purchase items online wherever they discover them, even if it\\'s not on a shopping site or app. And as people spend more of their online time on Twitter and other social apps, they should have the option to complete transactions quickly without leaving those apps, the thinking goes, rather than getting redirected to another site that may be difficult to navigate on a mobile phone. In addition to Twitter, Pinterest and Facebook have also bought into this thinking to some degree. Each has introduced \\'Buy\\' buttons, with varying levels of investment. But neither one of them currently works with Stripe on the Relay product. The open question for Stripe is whether retailers and users will show real interest in Twitter\\'s Buy buttons without the company promoting them — and, if not, whether Stripe can find another big-name app to replace Twitter as the anchor partner.\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon built a tool that puts Alexa in your browser:\\xa0Amazon\\'s Alexa personal assistant is super useful in the Echo and lot of fun to use. But if you don\\'t have an Echo or can\\'t buy one because you\\'re outside of the US, it can be hard to appreciate Alexa\\'s skill set. In light of this, Amazon has created a web app that lets you play with Alexa right in your browser.\\xa0You can access the web app at echosim.io and it lets you ask Alexa all kinds of questions. What it doesn\\'t let you experience is the always listening nature of the Echo device and its far field microphone array — you have to click and hold a button on the site before you speak to it. (That makes it closer to the experience you get with the Amazon Tap than the Echo itself.)\\xa0The real purpose of this simulator is to let international devs see what Alexa is capable of, since Amazon doesn\\'t yet the Echo or other Alexa devices outside of the US. Amazon says it was inspired by a project from a hackathon last year. Still, it\\'s open to anyone with an Amazon account, so fire it up and start pelting Alexa with questions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle Prevails as Jury Rebuffs Oracle in Code Copyright Case:\\xa0A jury ruled in favor of Google on Thursday in a long legal dispute withOracle over software used to power most of the world’s smartphones.\\xa0Oracle contended that Google used copyrighted material in 11,000 of its 13 million lines of software code in Android, its mobile phone operating system. Oracle asked for $9 billion from Google. Google said it made fair use of that code and owed nothing.\\xa0The victory for Google cheered other software developers, who operate much the way Google did when it comes to so-called open-source software. Unlike traditional software created by corporations and tightly held, open-source products are released, often with some restrictions, for anyone to use and modify.\\xa0“Great news for progress and innovation,” Chris Dixon, a technology investor with Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm, posted on Twitter after the verdict.\\xa0Android relies in part on Java, an open-source software language that Oracle acquired when it bought Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion in 2010. Oracle argued that Google executives violated Oracle’s copyright by using aspects of Java without permission. The courtroom fight was something of a watershed for technology and could offer clarity on legal rules surrounding open-source technology, which is used in everything from smartphones and digital recording devices to the software that runs many of the world’s biggest data centers.\\xa0People who work with open-source technology worried that a victory for Oracle would have led other companies to make similar demands of open-source products.\\xa0“It does give a lot of breathing room to other companies and individuals trying to do a lot of innovative activity,” said Parker Higgins, director of copyright activism at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights advocacy group.\\n\\n\\nBessemer-Backed Twilio Files for Initial Public Offering:\\xa0Twilio Inc., the San Francisco-based company that helps clients including Uber Technologies Inc. build web and mobile applications, filed for an initial public offering.\\xa0The software developer, backed by Bessemer Venture Partners, filed with an initial offering size of $100 million, a placeholder amount used to calculate fees that will probably change.\\xa0Twilio had more than 28,000 active customers at the end of March, according to the prospectus filed Thursday. They include enterprise-software company Box Inc., department-store chain Nordstrom Inc. and rideshare company Uber.\\xa0Twilio said in the filing its communications software is embedded in Uber’s mobile app, helping it update riders in real-time about their ride requests as well as helping the company scale its business. Bessemer holds a stake of 28.5 percent in Twilio, according to the prospectus. Union Square Ventures holds 13.6 percent and Fidelity owns 6.1 percent.\\xa0Twilio has yet to make a profit. It posted a net loss of about $36 million in 2015, on sales of $167 million, even as revenue grew 88 percent that year after a 78 percent bump in 2014. The company said that it expects its growth rate to decline over time.\\xa0WhatsApp Inc. contributed a significant chunk of that revenue. The messaging tool owned by Facebook Inc. uses Twilio’s technology in its applications to verify new and existing users. WhatsApp accounted for 17 percent of Twilio’s sales last year and 15 percent in the first three months of 2016.\\n\\n\\n\\nSnapchat raises $1.81 billion in new funding round:\\xa0Messaging app Snapchat has raised $1.81 billion in funding, the company reported in a U.S. regulatory filing on Thursday, a sign that investor interest is strong despite concerns among some venture capitalists that the platform is struggling to attract advertisers.\\xa0Venture capital database PitchBook estimated the company\\'s valuation after the financing at $17.81 billion, up from $16 billion at it most recent financing in February.Snapchat, headquartered in Venice, California, has faced concerns from big investors familiar with the company that its estimated valuation is not justified because of an uneven revenue stream. Its advertising business, which began last October, is the company\\'s only significant revenue source.\\xa0But, with a strong user base of 13- to 24-year-olds, the app provides an attractive platform to reach millennials and hook young consumers on brands. The company has more than 100 million active users, about 60 percent of whom are 13- to 24-year-olds.\\xa0Snapchat early this year raised $175 million from Fidelity Investments in a \"flat round\" of financing that did not adjust the company\\'s valuation. The mutual fund bought shares at $30.72 each.\\xa0Fidelity has repeatedly adjusted the estimated valuation of its stake in the company, slashing it by at least 25 percent last year only to boost it by more than 60 percent in February.\\xa0Investors in this latest round include General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital, T. Rowe Price and Lone Pine, among others, tech blog TechCrunch reported on Thursday. TechCrunch also reported that Snapchat\\'s revenues in 2015 were $59 million, according to a presentation to investors that was seen by the news site. That\\'s up from $3.1 million for the first 11 months of 2014, sources told Reuters last year.\\n\\nInMobi grapples with senior, mid-level attrition amid concerns about future:\\xa0Online advertising startup InMobi , one of India\\'s early \\'unicorns,\\' is struggling to retain senior executives amid questions about whether new strategic initiatives are working as well as worries about the future of the company.\\xa0InMobi, which was founded by Naveen Tewari in 2007 and was the first startup in which Japan\\'s SoftBank invested, now has some 1,500 employees compared to twice that number at its peak. The Japanese conglomerate, which has since backed Snapdeal and Ola, poured $200 million into InMobi in 2011 but wrote down most of that amount in 2014. The exits also come during a time when InMobi is struggling to raise funds and chart out a sustainable business model that can adapt to the massive changes that are taking place in the online and mobile advertising space, according to both current and former executives at the company. According to these executives, InMobi, which was estimated to be valued at $1 billion, now generates between around $300 million in annual revenue. InMobi has not registered profits since its founding in 2007. InMobi\\'s challenges have been compounded by the fact that its flagship product Miip -- that targeted global retailers like Walmart -- hasn\\'t taken off. Miip also took much longer than expected to scale and customers found the product underwhelming, according to at least two customers who have used the product.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

It was down less than 1 percent this year through Tuesday.\\n\\n\\nIn Silicon Valley, Gossip, Anger and Revenge:\\xa0Silicon Valley likes to keep the media on a tight leash. Tech executives expect obedience, if not reverence, from reporters. They dole out information as grudgingly as possible. Sometimes they simply buy a chunk of a publication, a time-honored method of influencing what is deemed fit to write about.\\xa0Valleywag declined to play the game.\\xa0It was a gossip sheet for the digital age: abrasive, knowing, cynical, self-promoting, sometimes unfair. It dispensed snark by the truckload, printing things that people knew or surmised but were off the table. It said Google co-founder Larry Page had dated his then-colleague, Marissa Mayer. That the Google chairman Eric Schmidt was a playboy and a scamp. That the Napster co-founder and early Facebook executive Sean Parker’s wedding was seriously over the top.\\xa0Most notoriously, at least in retrospect, the tech gossip blog said in late 2007 that Peter Thiel, who co-founded PayPal and was an early and significant investor in Facebook, was gay. This was gossip with an attitude, and an agenda. And what it unleashed was Mr. Thiel’s ire. He secretly financed a suit brought by the wrestler Hulk Hogan against Valleywag’s parent, Gawker Media, which has resulted in $140 million in damages. Gawker is appealing.\\xa0The revelation of Mr. Thiel’s involvement in the suit this week brings the complicated relationship of Silicon Valley and the media once again to the forefront. The technology world is ever more important and richer, with smartphones in everyone’s pocket conveying a stream of news that Silicon Valley not only delivers, but helps shape. At the same time, the tech companies are less transparent about what they do.\\n\\n\\nHP Inc profit beats Street amid weak market for PCs, printers:\\xa0HP Inc, which houses the former Hewlett-Packard Co\\'s legacy hardware business, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit as aggressive cost cutting helped counter weak demand for personal computers and printers.\\xa0The company\\'s shares reversed course to trade up more than 2 percent at $12.45 after the bell on Wednesday.

It’s expensive to build their own, so they are turning to a public cloud infrastructure provider like Amazon to do the heavy lifting for them.\\xa0Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff spoke glowingly of AWS. “There is no public cloud infrastructure provider that is more sophisticated or has more robust enterprise capabilities for supporting the needs of our growing global customer base,” he said in a statement.\\xa0It’s worth keeping in mind, however that Salesforce also has a deep relationship with Microsoft — and CEO Satya Nadella appeared on stage at Dreamforce, Salesforce’s massive customer conference last fall.\\xa0But the relationship has a flip side and the companies also compete with one another. R Ray Wang, who is principal at Constellation Research, points out that this announcement should help Salesforce compete with Oracle and Microsoft overseas.\\n\\n\\nTerrapattern is reverse image search for maps, powered by a neural network:\\xa0Terrapattern is a visual search engine that, from the first moment you use it, you wonder: Why didn’t Google come up with this 10 years ago? Click on a feature on the map — a baseball diamond, a marina, a roundabout — and it immediately highlights everything its algorithm thinks looks like it. It’s remarkably fast, simple to use and potentially very powerful.\\xa0Go ahead and give it a try first to see how natural it is to search for something. How does that work? And how did a handful of digital artists and developers create it — and for under $35,000? The secret, as with so many other interesting visual computing projects these days, is a convolutional neural network. It’s essentially an AI-like program that extracts every little detail from an image and looks for patterns at various levels of organization — similar to how our own visual system works, though the brain is infinitely more subtle and flexible.\\xa0In Terrapattern’s case, the neural network was trained to look at small squares of the landscape and, comparing those patterns to a huge database of tagged map features from OpenStreetMap, it learned to associate them with certain concepts.\\xa0Think of how a camera recognizes a face and knows when it is blinking or smiling. It doesn’t actually “know” what faces, smiles and eyes are, but it associates them with certain patterns of pixels, and can reliably pick them out. Once Terrapattern had been trained to recognize and categorize all manner of geographical features, from boats to water towers, its creators set it free on detailed maps of the greater New York, Pittsburgh, Detroit and San Francisco areas. It scoured the landscape and built a huge database of features and similarities — which can be quickly queried and the results returned immediately (the neural network isn’t doing any “thinking” when you click on a feature — its work is done for this dataset).\\xa0Of course, you could just search for “tennis fields in Oakland” or the like and get perfectly good results, but this allows one to search for things that may not be listed so formally. What if you were looking for houses in the middle of fields, or cul de sacs, or dead lawns, or circular parking lots? Terrapattern knows where those are just as much as it knows where the airports and ferry terminals are. They’re all just assemblages of features to the neural network.\\n\\n\\nFacebook will shut down FBX, its desktop ad exchange:\\xa0Facebook plans to shut down FBX, the ad exchange that allows advertisers to buy retargeted desktop ads using third-party tools like Criteo and AppNexus.\\xa0The news was first reported in The Wall Street Journal and we’ve confirmed it with Facebook. In an emailed statement, Vice President of Monetization Product Marketing Matt Idema suggested that this is part of Facebook’s shift to mobile (in its most recent earnings report, mobile accounted for 82 percent of Facebook’s ad revenue). He said:\\xa0\"Mobile is now a necessary component of effective marketing campaigns, and Facebook is helping millions of businesses understand their customers’ purchase path across devices. Dynamic Ads and Custom Audiences have mobile at their core and are delivering excellent results for businesses, so Facebook Exchange spending has shifted towards those solutions. This is about giving people more relevant ads and marketers more effective formats, especially in an increasingly mobile world. Our ads API is open to all developers so they can innovate on our platform and build great ad experiences for brands and their customers.\"\\xa0Facebook launched FBX back in 2012, but its focus seemed to have shifted away from the exchange in recent years.\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft is giving up on consumer smartphones, too:\\xa0The company is taking a $950 million charge to unwind the last vestiges of the Nokia deal. Microsoft is further scaling back its flagging phone business, exiting the consumer market and cutting another 1,850 jobs.\\xa0As part of the move announced Wednesday, Microsoft will take a $950 million charge and cut what little remained of its Finland-based phone hardware business, unwinding the last of its disastrous $7.2 billion acquisition of Nokia\\'s phone unit.\\xa0Last week, Microsoft announced separately that it was selling what was left of its low-end\"feature phone\" business. \\xa0The company has been scaling back its phone ambitions ever since the Nokia deal closed, with CEO Satya Nadella quickly shifting to a strategy focused on bringing Microsoft\\'s software and services to Android and iOS rather than trying to convince phone buyers to shift to Windows.\\xa0Despite all the cuts — and having already seen its market share dip below 1 percent — Microsoft says it isn\\'t totally out of the phone-making business.\\xa0The company insists it will continue to serve phones aimed at the business market and license Windows 10 to any other hardware makers that want to give Windows Phone a try.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nToyota and Volkswagen Step Up Investments in Tech Start-Ups:\\xa0On Tuesday,\\xa0two of the world’s largest automakers, Toyota and Volkswagen, said they were stepping up to invest in technology start-ups that are working to change the way people travel by car. Toyota said it had formed a partnership with and invested an undisclosed amount in Uber, the biggest ride-hailing company. Gett, the app popular in Europe, said it was working with Volkswagen, and the automaker was investing $300 million in the start-up. The alliances are the latest in a string of pairings between technology companies and traditional automakers that are scrambling to reposition themselves. For decades, automakers had abided by the well-worn formula of making bigger and more powerful cars to fuel their growth. But start-ups like Uber and Lyft and technology companies like Google and Tesla have disrupted that cadence. These companies, mostly located in Silicon Valley, have in the last few years sped the development of self-driving cars, electric vehicles and ride services. Automakers have become increasingly concerned about those technologies and their potential to help people travel easily and cheaply without owning a car — or even without knowing how to drive. In January, General Motors invested $500 million in Lyft, the ride-hailing app popular with American users, with a focus on developing networks of autonomous vehicles. Ford Motor is making over its Dearborn, Mich., headquarters into a Silicon Valley-like campus of green buildings connected by self-driving shuttles.\\xa0And a few weeks ago, Fiat Chrysler and Google agreed to produce a test fleet of driverless minivans. Both BMW and Mercedes-Benz have started to pilot ride services.\\xa0Even other technology companies only tangentially related to automobiles are becoming more involved in ride services. Apple, which is working on its own autos project, said this month it had invested $1 billion in Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing company that competes fiercely with Uber.\\n\\n\\nFrench Tax Investigators Swoop on Google’s Paris Offices:\\xa0French police and prosecutors swooped on Google’s Paris offices on Tuesday, intensifying a tax-fraud probe amid accusations across Europe that the Internet giant fails to pay its fair share.\\xa0The raids are part of preliminary criminal investigation opened in June 2015 after French tax authorities lodged a complaint, according to a statement from the nation’s financial prosecutor. The probe is seeking to verify whether Google’s Irish unit has permanent establishment in France and whether the firm failed to declare part of its revenues in France.\\xa0Prosecutors will probably go after Google’s management in Ireland, according to Alain Frenkel, a tax lawyer in Paris. “That doesn’t mean Google won’t also face a recovery order from France’s tax authorities,” he said in a phone interview.\\xa0The raids come as Google, which is part of parent company Alphabet Inc., faces outrage in Europe over the small amount of tax it pays in the region. France has called on the company to pay back taxes of about 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion).\\xa0While no one has been charged of any wrongdoing, French penalties for aggravated tax fraud have recently been ramped up. Convicted managers can potentially face as long as 7 years in jail and a 2 million-euro fine.\\n\\n\\nHewlett Packard Enterprise will spin off its troubled services business in an $8.5 billion deal:\\xa0Six months after the Silicon Valley stalwart Hewlett-Packard split into two companies, one half announced a surprise plan to split yet again.\\xa0Hewlett Packard Enterprise said it will spin off its long-troubled services unit and merge it with the IT services firm CSC in a deal worth about $8.5 billion.\\xa0The complex deal, in which HPE will combine its $20 billion Enterprise Services unit — accounting for more than one third of HPE\\'s 2015 revenue — with CSC into a combined company of which HPE shareholders will end up owning about half.\\xa0The total consideration of the deal includes the creation of $4.5 billion of new shares, a cash dividend worth $1.5 billion, and the transfer of about $2.5 billion in debt and other liabilities off HPE\\'s books and into the new company. HPE also expects to trim its operating costs by about $1 billion as a result of the spinoff.\\xa0What will remain at HPE is a leaner $32 billion company that leads the world in sales of servers, the computers that are stacked together in data center racks that power the Internet. It competes with networking giant Cisco Systems in selling gear for corporate networks, with EMC in data storage gear, and also sports a small software business that did about $3.6 billion in sales last year. The new company — HPE and CSC are calling it Spinco for now — will be a pure player in the low-margin, IT outsourcing market that had been a shrinking, expensive weight around the old HP\\'s neck during the time it was struggling to bounce back. Revenue in the unit has declined for several years, during years that its customers went through wrenching changes in how they purchase and consume technology.\\xa0The move will also unwind what in hindsight has turned out to be one of the worst acquisitions in the old HP\\'s history, the $14 billion acquisition of the IT services firm EDS, consummated in 2008 under yet another prior HP CEO, Mark Hurd, now the CEO of Oracle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSnapchat is raising more money around $20 billion valuation:\\xa0Snapchat may have first made its name in the crowded world of mobile apps with an ephemeral messaging service, but the startup and its wildly popular app are not disappearing anywhere soon. TechCrunch has learned from multiple sources that Snapchat is raising yet more financing at around a $20 billion valuation. Sources with knowledge of the deal say the social media giant is in the process of a round of about $200 million. This new financing, we understand, is a follow-on to the $175 million Series F round led by Fidelity. Snapchat was said to be valued at $16 billion in that round, flat on the year before. However, filings from earlier this month and embedded below, uncovered for us by market analysts VC Experts, show that the Series F was expanded.Expanding the Series F with a Series FP, as it’s described in the document below, would also fit in with a description we’ve heard more than once about Snapchat’s fundraising: The startup is “always raising” on a “rolling” basis, partly because investors are so interested. “They get offers all the time,” one investor close to the company said. “And once you start to grow on this path, many people come to give you money. You don’t know how to value the company, so the best way to do that is to do some kind of rolling funding. When you have a hot company and many people are approaching you, you do a market of discovery.” That may be different from other startups, but in a way it reflects Snapchat’s own fast growth and its taste for trying out new things like QR codes to connect to accounts and content, their crazy face-changing filters and more.\\n\\n\\nSpotify revenue surged, losses grew too, but far more slowly - \\xa0which is great news for Spotify:\\xa0Spotify lost more money in 2015. \\xa0And its managers and investors are probably very happy about that.\\xa0That\\'s because the music streaming service\\'s revenue increased much faster than its losses — something it hasn\\'t always been able to say. \\xa0Given that Spotify has told its investors it is headed for an IPO in the next few years, it\\'s the kind of performance it will need to be able to replicate with consistency.\\xa0Filings show that Spotify, based in Sweden and the U.K., generated revenue of $2.12 billion last year, up about 80 percent from the $1.18 billion it brought in the prior year (all prices in the story converted from euros to dollars at the exchange rate from December 31, 2015). Losses, meanwhile, hit $188.7 million — but that number was only up 6.7 percent from the previous year\\'s total of $176.9 million.\\xa0That\\'s a much, much better performance than 2014, when Spotify\\'s losses ballooned by 289 percent, and its revenue was only up 45 percent.\\xa0As in the past, most of Spotify\\'s revenue comes from its subscription service, which now boasts more than 25 million users worldwide. And most of that money goes right back out the door to music labels, artists and other music rights-holders.\\xa0If Spotify can keep it up, then it will have pulled off something special by showing it can run — and grow — a streaming music service at scale. Traditionally, streaming music services have struggled because their music expenses increased at the same pace as their growth — or even faster than their growth.\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon no longer offers price match refunds on anything but TVs:\\xa0Amazon has quietly ended its price protection policy on all products except for televisions. The change to the company’s policy comes at a time when a handful of startups have launched to help consumers automate the process of requesting refunds when prices change on online sites, including Amazon and dozens of other e-commerce stores.\\xa0For example, newcomer Earny recently debuted a mobile app that helps consumers get their money back on purchases after price drops. Earny co-founder Oded Vakrat says that, so far, around 50 percent of the refund requests the app handled were for Amazon purchases. Earny also competes with Paribus, which offers a similar service both online and on mobile. Meanwhile, older sites like camelcamelcamel allow consumers to track Amazon price drops and receive alerts.\\xa0Prior to this policy change, Amazon’s price protection policy was already one of the least friendly to consumers, as it used to provide seven days of price matching on price drops. That means if you purchased an item from Amazon which the company later marked down, you could request a refund. However, unlike many stores, Amazon only matched its own prices for items, not competitors’ pricing — with the exception of TVs and cell phones.\\xa0In comparison, other stores have more pro-consumer policies, including Best Buy, which provides price matching during its return and exchange period (15 days is standard) and Walmart, which offers 90 days of protection, for example. As for how this change will impact startups like Earny and Paribus? Vakrat optimistically referred to this blow as a “great opportunity” to show why consumers need startups like Earny to have their back.\\xa0Amazon insists that its price policy has not changed — it says that its prices are dynamic and that its customer service agents have made exceptions in the past, but that wasn’t the rule. In addition, Amazon wants to caution its customers that sharing their credentials with third-parties puts their accounts at risk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo halt smartphone slide, Samsung rewrites playbook:\\xa0From the way it chooses smartphone components to the models it brings to market, Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) has undergone a painful process of breaking from its past to reverse a slide in its handset business. For example, the world\\'s largest smartphone maker agonized over camera specs for its flagship Galaxy S7 until the last moment - ultimately defying industry convention by opting for fewer pixels in exchange for improved autofocus features and low-light performance, a move that contributed to early success. It also pared back its product line-up, overcoming internal resistance, enabling it to streamline production, an executive said. The handset business has now stabilized, and had its best profit in nearly two years in January-March, though historically low smartphone industry growth still leaves Samsung looking for the \"next big thing\". After peaking in 2013, a sharp drop in mobile profits exposed Samsung as slow to adjust to the changing market: its budget devices were overpriced and unappealing versus Chinese offerings, and the 2014 version of its Galaxy S flopped. That prompted a cull among executives and stoked investor worries Samsung might not be able to recover as rivals including Apple, Huawei \\xa0and Xiaomi gained market share at its expense. There was no sweeping, across-the-board fix. Rather, Samsung embarked two years ago on an overhaul that included a shift from a phone-for-all-needs approach towards a line-up that emphasized economies of scale. It revamped design, using metal frames and curved screens, and gave high-end features such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens to its low- and mid-tier products. The product cull paid off; the revamped models helped Samsung recover in big markets such as India. \"There was a feeling the sheer number of phones in the market was confusing for customers,\" said a Samsung India executive, declining to be identified as he was not authorized to speak with the media.Samsung\\'s Kim says his focus now is on premium-end smartphones - those costing $600 and above - where not all industry players have the muscle to compete.\\n\\n\\nSelling Uber Shares May Be Tougher Than You Think:\\xa0SharesPost Inc., a broker of private technology stocks, approached investors with what seemed like an alluring offer: a potential investment in a fund that would hold Uber Technologies Inc. shares. In exchange for exposure to the high-flying ride-hailing startup, they were asked to part with at least $100,000 each and agree to hold the stake until the company goes public or gets acquired, with no vote in business decisions or visibility into its operations or finances.\\xa0But SharesPost said it called off the proposed deal. The plan was to purchase as much as $10 million in preferred shares from Uber’s most recent round of financing and package them in an investment fund to be sold at a premium, according to offering documents obtained by Bloomberg.\\xa0SharesPost said it wouldn’t pursue the transaction, citing a “lack of investor interest.” “It became clear that the minimum funds would not be collected for this deal, and as a result, the sales team began to inform interested clients of this fact,” Greg Berardi, a spokesman for SharesPost, wrote in an e-mail.\\xa0The erstwhile offering shows the complexity of giving investors the chance to gain shares in a startup that wants to tightly control who gets a sliver, no matter how small. Like many startups, Uber limits sales of its shares. Such transactions can distort a company\\'s valuation, leave control in the hands of unknown investors and result in tax liabilities for the company, its employees and other shareholders. Uber declined to comment on the SharesPost proposal, but a spokeswoman said when Uber learns of potential unauthorized shares on the market, the company contacts the people involved.\\xa0SharesPost\\'s role in share sales has drawn regulatory scrutiny. The broker settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2012 to resolve claims that the online marketplace for private-company shares acted as an unregistered broker. SharesPost paid $80,000 and Greg Brogger, then the company’s president, paid $20,000, without admitting wrongdoing. Brogger is now SharesPost’s chief executive officer and chairman, and the company is registered with the SEC. SharesPost\\'s spokesman called the 2012 settlement “completely irrelevant to a 2016 fund that never got off the ground.”\\xa0Speaking to a Silicon Valley audience in March, SEC Chair Mary Jo White cautioned that secondary transactions could amplify “errors or misconceptions in valuation.” She highlighted the lack of transparency in such deals as cause for concern.\\xa0For the proposed Uber transaction, the documents said a fund managed by a member of SharesPost’s board of directors would buy the shares at a 2 percent premium to their price in last year’s funding round, which valued the company at $62.5 billion, and then resell them for 5 percent more. It’s unclear where the SharesPost fund would acquire the Uber stake from. VC Experts, a private-market research firm, estimated that the transaction would give Uber an implied valuation of more the $70 billion.\\n\\n\\nModi’s Mini-Shuttle Set to Blast Into Elon Musk’s Race for Space:\\xa0India is set to launch a scale model of a reusable spacecraft on Monday, a project that in time could pit the nation against billionaires Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk in the race to make access to space cheaper and easier.\\xa0The winged vessel -- one-fifth of full size -- is due to blast off on a rocket from Sriharikota base on the southeastern coast, reach an altitude of 70 kilometers (43 miles) and glide back at supersonic speeds to Earth for a splashdown in the Bay of Bengal, the Indian Space Research Organisation said.India put a probe into Mars orbit in 2014 for just $74 million, demonstrating a combination of technological capability and low costs that chimes with the goal of more frequent space travel being championed by Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and Bezos’s Blue Origin LLC. Both companies seek to curb costs by making rockets reusable and are conducting test launches more often.India plans to spend about 75 billion rupees ($1.1 billion) on its entire space program in the year through March 2017, a fraction of the yearly $19-billion-dollar budget of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the U.S. \\xa0The reusable space vehicle is supposed to provide a cost-effective and reliable option for operations such as launching satellites, according to the Indian space agency. Mock-upson government websites resemble the long-defunct NASA space shuttles.The nation remains about eight years away from a full-scale version of the reusable space vehicle, and still has to cross the hurdle of steering the vessel safely back to land rather than water, according to the Indian space agency.\\xa0Musk’s SpaceX in December pulled off a soft, vertical touchdown after the two-stage rocket propelled its payload. Less than month earlier, Bezos sent one of his test rockets to the edge of space and landed it safely back on Earth.\\xa0\"India has to start somewhere, sometime,\" Lele said. \"That time is now.\"\\n\\n\\nStart-Ups Once Showered With Cash Now Have to Work for It:\\xa0The balance of power is shifting across tech start-up land. Not long ago, entrepreneurs had the upper hand. With investors eager to get a piece of the next Uber or Airbnb, entrepreneurs often just lifted their little fingers to get financing. Some investors let the entrepreneurs choose their own terms, while others gave multimillion-dollar paydays to start-up founders long before their companies were a success. Now investors have the advantage. Instead of venture capitalists begging to be allowed to invest, entrepreneurs are coming to them begging for cash. Investors are exerting their newfound power by asking more questions about a start-up’s prospects and taking more time to invest. Some are pushing for management changes or for financing terms that would help cushion any losses they might face. “Venture capitalists are putting founders through everything short of a proctology exam before they invest,” said Venky Ganesan, a partner at Menlo Ventures, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm.\\xa0The changing balance of power is evident in the numbers. Venture capitalists have put less money into start-ups in the United States in the last two quarters, according to the National Venture Capital Association; funding dropped 11 percent to $12.1 billion in the first quarter from a year earlier. With a smaller capital pie, entrepreneurs have to work harder for a piece.\\xa0Investors have also been better able to negotiate financing terms that benefit them. According to a survey from the law firm Fenwick & West, investors of richly valued start-ups have been getting more provisions such as guaranteed payouts and minimum investment gains. Such terms are still relatively rare, but tend to become more common after the number and size of deals decline, said Barry Kramer, a Fenwick & West partner.\\xa0Above all, investors are no longer paying any price to invest in a start-up. Since the beginning of this year, about 30 companies have had to settle for lower valuations than they previously received when they raised money, according to the research firm CB Insights. That is nearly as many as in all of 2015.\\xa0“Investors have materially more time to do diligence than before,” said Ben Ling, a partner at venture capital firm Khosla Ventures. “Across our portfolio, even for the best companies, fund-raising is a longer process.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWarren Buffett Stake Suggests Apple Is All Grown Up:\\xa0With this week’s imprimatur from the legendary investor Warren Buffett, it should now be official: Apple, the world’s largest company by market capitalization and a symbol of American technological innovation, is a “value” stock.\\xa0That may prove to be a decidedly mixed blessing.\\xa0Mr. Buffett is the world’s most prominent and successful proponent of value investing — an approach that seeks stocks that are undervalued and sell for less than their “intrinsic value,” as Benjamin Graham put it his 1949 classic “The Intelligent Investor.” Mr. Buffett credits Mr. Graham with shaping his own approach to investing.\\xa0So value investors took notice when Mr. Buffett’s holding company,Berkshire Hathaway, disclosed it had invested $1 billion in Apple stock during the last quarter.\\xa0“We’ve just looked at it again,” said Bill Smead, who manages the Smead Value Fund, one of the most successful large-cap value mutual funds over the last five years, according to Morningstar. “Anybody that discounts the thinking at Berkshire Hathaway does so at their peril, in my opinion.”\\xa0Value stocks are typically unpopular among many investors, their shares often battered by disappointing short-term revenue and earnings results. They usually trade at very low price-to-earnings ratios, a common valuation measure. Nonetheless, some academic studies have suggested that over time, they outperform other stocks, in part because expectations are so low.\\xa0Today there are numerous value investors, value mutual funds and value exchange-traded funds that pursue variations of the strategy, many of them probably now considering adding Apple to their portfolios, if they haven’t already.\\xa0Apple “is going to attract more value investors,” said Toni Sacconaghi, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein who covers Apple. “They’re looking for beaten-down stocks with negative sentiment. Apple has traded below a market multiple for years and sentiment has become increasingly pessimistic, especially over the past month.”\\n\\n\\nWalmart Outperforms Estimates, but Online Retail Lags:\\xa0Walmart reported on Thursday that its quarterly revenue had risen 0.9 percent, exceeding analysts’ forecasts and signaling that its strategies to combat a tough retail environment were working. The results were particularly striking after dismal earnings reports by several retail chains last week, and Walmart’s shares shot up nearly 10 percent.Amazon does much more business than Walmart.com, Mr. Saunders said, and yet it still reports double-digit growth. Amazon reported that net product sales rose 13 percent, to $79.3 billion in 2015, while Walmart reported that global annual e-commerce revenue had risen 12 percent to $13.7 billion in its latest fiscal year. In other areas, Walmart significantly outperformed its peers.Over all, Walmart reported that profit fell to $3.08 billion, or 98 cents a share, compared with $3.34 billion, or $1.03 a share, a year earlier. That beat expectations of 88 cents a share, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue was $115.9 billion; analysts had expected $113.2 billion.“Walmart, especially with apparel, did better than other retailers for a really stressful period,” Mr. Sosnick said.\\n\\n\\nSalesforce Surges as Big Money Deals Help Drive Sales Growth: Salesforce.com Inc. is targeting the biggest of customers to get big itself. The company, once known for selling business productivity software to small- and medium-sized clients, is getting more traction with large companies while drawing closer to an annual sales goal of $10 billion. Salesforce said Wednesday it landed the most large deals ever in a three-month period during the fiscal first quarter, including one worth at least $100 million. The company also forecast revenue in the current quarter that topped analysts’ estimates, sending shares up the most in almost three months Thursday. Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff is benefiting from a multiyear effort to persuade corporations to adopt software delivered over the Internet, or the cloud. During a call with analysts, the company touted new deals with Samsung Electronics Co., Uber Technologies Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. that expanded on existing relationships. Salesforce jumped 4.1 percent to $81.09, at the close in New York, the biggest advance since Feb. 25. That brings the gains for the year to 3.4 percent.\\xa0Sales will be $2.01 billion to $2.02 billion in the fiscal second quarter, the San Francisco-based company said in a statement. Analysts on average had estimated $1.98 billion, according to data complied by Bloomberg. Revenue increased 27 percent to $1.92 billion in the fiscal first quarter ended April 30, topping the average estimate of $1.89 billion.\\n\\n\\nSamsung to partner with Alibaba on mobile payments in China:\\xa0Samsung Electronics said it had struck a deal with a Alibaba Group Holding for owners of its phones to be able to more easily make payments with Alipay accounts - a move it hopes will boost sales in the world\\'s biggest smartphone market.\\xa0Users of Samsung Pay will also have the option of paying with their Alipay accounts without having separately access the Alipay application. Alipay, which is operated by Alibaba unit Ant Financial Services Group, has 450 million active registered users.\\xa0Samsung, the world\\'s top smartphone maker, launched its own mobile payment system, Samsung Pay, in China in March, about one month after Apple Inc launched Apple Pay.But Alipay\\'s dominant position has meant that it will be difficult for any latecomers in mobile payments to gain significant ground just on their own.\\xa0Samsung has been losing out to Chinese rivals Huawei and Xiaomi as well as Apple and no longer ranks among the top five smartphone brands in China, according to market researcher Strategy Analytics.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis $5 Billion Software Company Has No Sales Staff:\\xa0Atlassian sold $320 million worth of business software last year without a single sales employee. Everyone else in the industry noticed.: Atlassian, which makes popular project-management and chat apps such as Jira and HipChat, doesn’t run on sales quotas and end-of-quarter discounts. In fact, its sales team doesn’t pitch products to anyone, because Atlassian doesn’t have a sales team. Initially an anomaly in the world of business software, the Australian company has become a beacon for other businesses counting on word of mouth to build market share. “Customers don’t want to call a salesperson if they don’t have to,” says Scott Farquhar, Atlassian’s co-chief executive officer. “They’d much rather be able to find the answers on the website.” The way technology companies sell software has changed dramatically in the past decade. The availability of open source alternatives has pushed traditional brands and rising challengers to offer more free trials, free basic versions of their software with paid upgrades, and online promotions. Incumbents such as IBM, Oracle, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which employ thousands of commissioned salespeople, are acquiring open source or cloud companies that sell differently, says Laurie Wurster, an analyst at researcher Gartner. Slack, Dropbox, and GitHub are among the companies trying to attract corporate clients with small-bore efforts that rely largely on good reviews. The idea is to distribute products to individuals or small groups at potential customers big and small and hope interest spreads upstairs. So far, though, Atlassian remains the most extreme example of this model. It’s a 14-year-old company, valued at $5 billion since going public in December, without a single salesperson on the payroll. More than 80 Fortune 100 companies use Atlassian’s software, and venture capitalists and peers often talk about trying to follow, at least partly, its sales strategy.Atlassian’s roots lie in Sydney’s barren tech scene. It was kept aloft early on not by venture capital, but by the founders’ credit cards, meaning it didn’t have impatient investors to answer to. “I don’t think their success is replicable,” says Tomasz Tunguz, a partner at Redpoint Ventures.\\n\\n\\nCisco\\'s forecast tops Wall Street estimates; shares rise:\\xa0Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc reported better-than-expected results and gave an upbeat forecast for the current quarter, sending its shares up about 7 percent in extended trading.\\xa0The company has been beefing up its wireless security and datacenter businesses to offset the impact of sluggish spending by telecom carriers and enterprises on its main business of making network switches and routers.\\xa0Results in the latest reported quarter were mainly driven by a 17 percent jump in sales in its security business, which offers firewall protection as well as intrusion detection and prevention systems. Revenue in the company\\'s collaboration unit, which sells IP phones, rose 10 percent in the third quarter ended April 30. Sales in the data center business, which makes servers, rose 1 percent.\\xa0The company\\'s legacy switches and routers business is still by far its largest, accounting for nearly 60 percent of total revenue.\\xa0Sales in the switching unit fell 3 percent, while router sales fell 5 percent, painting a grim picture of corporate technology spending.The company\\'s net profit fell to $2.35 billion, or 46 cents per share, in the third quarter, from $2.44 billion, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier.\\xa0Excluding items, the company earned 57 cents per share.\\xa0Analysts on an average had expected a profit of 55 cents per share and revenue of $11.97 billion.\\xa0Revenue fell to $12.00 billion from $12.14 billion.\\n\\n\\nTesla to raise $1.4 billion with public offering to fund Model 3 production:Tesla will raise at least $1.4 billion through a secondary stock offering, the company announced in SEC filings today, and an additional 5.5 million shares will be purchased by CEO Elon Musk via a stock option exercise. The funds will be used to \"accelerate the production ramp of Model 3,\" according to the filing, with Tesla moving its 500,000 vehicle per year build plan to 2018 from 2020.\\xa0Musk will exercise all his outstanding stock options for a total of 5,503,972 shares, with 2,777,901 of those being offered for sale to cover his tax burden. Tesla will not receive any of the proceeds from that sale, and Musk\\'s net holdings in Tesla will increase.\\xa0The Tesla Model 3 was unveiled in March and is the first \"affordable\" Tesla car, priced at around $35,000. Tesla says it will go more than 215 miles on a full charge and the success of the Model 3 will determine the future of the company. The first deliveries of the car are expected in late 2017, with volume production beginning in 2018.\\xa0Initial demand for the car appears to be very strong, with the company reporting that it had taken roughly 400,000 preorders with refundable $1,000 deposits as of late April. In the filing Tesla revealed that as of May 15th, it currently had 373,000 preorders after 8,000 customer cancellations and 4,200 duplicate orders were cancelled by the company.\\xa0Tesla is no stranger to secondary offerings. It raised around $500 million in a smaller offering last year.\\n\\n\\nLinkedIn Says Hackers Are Trying to Sell Fruits of Huge 2012 Data Breach:\\xa0\\xa0LinkedIn said on Wednesday that hackers were attempting to sell what they claimed were 117 million email addresses and passwords of its users, suggesting that a data breach in 2012 was magnitudes bigger than initially thought.LinkedIn is investigating the authenticity of the data, the company said. But a security researcher, Troy Hunt, said on Twitter that he had verified a portion of the breach and that it was “highly likely this is legit.” The hacker is trying to sell the data on an illegal marketplace for five bitcoin, or about $2,200, according to Motherboard.\\xa0In 2012, the account information of 6.5 million users was posted to a Russian hacker site. LinkedIn settled a class-action lawsuit in 2015, agreeing to compensate 800,000 people who had paid for its premium services.\\xa0Since the attack, the company has stepped up its security procedures, including enabling two-step verification, a technique security experts recommend for your most sensitive online accounts.\\n\\n\\nGoogle Home vs. Amazon Echo. Let the Battle Begin.\\xa0Google on Wednesday introduced Google Home, a voice-controlled, Internet-connected speaker that competes directly with Amazon’s smart speaker, Echo, which costs $180. The company also introduced Allo, a messaging app, and a rebranding of its virtual assistant.\\xa0Here’s a quick explanation of what these major announcements, made at the Google I/O developer conference, mean for consumers.\\xa0What do Home and Echo have in common?\\xa0Home and Echo are both speakers that require a wired power connection. They stream music and perform tasks like web searches, adding calendar appointments and looking up movie showtimes over an Internet connection.\\xa0What are the differences between Google Home and Amazon Echo?\\xa0Google has yet to share many important details, including a price tag, about Google Home, which is scheduled for release this fall. However, from the announcement we can glean a few differences:\\xa0Home, which can easily be held in one hand, is shorter and more compact than Echo.\\xa0Both speakers have a cylindrical shape, but the top of Home is slanted downward, whereas Echo’s top is flat. Google is allowing consumers to choose from different colors for the bottom part of Home, while Echo comes only in black. (Amazon also sells a smaller voice-controlled speaker called Tap.)\\xa0Most important, the brains of Home will be Google’s virtual assistant, which draws from Google’s extensive search database, whereas Echo relies on Alexa, Amazon’s assistant. In other words, consumers can expect voice commands that already work with Google’s assistant to work with Google Home. In a recent test comparing virtual assistants from Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft, Google’s assistant was the most capable of performing basic tasks, largely because it drew data from Google’s search engine.\\xa0Is Home smarter than Echo?\\xa0Thanks to Home’s reliance on Google’s search engine, it will probably be a smarter speaker than the Echo when it comes to basic tasks like web searches and looking up traffic data. However, when it comes to actions offered by outside companies — like the ability to order a pizza from a restaurant or to set your Internet-connected thermostat — Home’s success will depend largely on whether Google persuades third-party developers to create tasks that work with it.\\n\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChina Quietly Targets U.S. Tech Companies in Security Reviews:\\xa0Chinese authorities are quietly scrutinizing technology products sold in China by Apple and other big foreign companies, focusing on whether they pose potential security threats to the country and its consumers and opening up a new front in an already tense relationship with Washington over digital security.\\xa0Apple and other companies in recent months have been subjected to reviews that target encryption and the data storage of tech products, said people briefed on the reviews who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the reviews, Chinese officials require executives or employees of the foreign tech companies to answer questions about the products in person, according to these people.\\xa0The reviews are run by a committee associated with the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s Internet control bureau, they said. The bureau includes experts and engineers with ties to the country’s military and security agencies. While other countries, including the United States and Britain, conduct reviews of some tech products, they usually focus on products that will be used by the military or other parts of the government that are concerned with security, and not on products sold to the general public.\\xa0The Chinese reviews stand out because they are being applied more broadly, including to American consumer software and gadgets popular in China, the people briefed on the reviews said. And because Chinese officials have not disclosed the nature of the checks, both the United States government and American tech companies fear that the reviews could be used to extract tech knowledge as well as ensure that the United States was not using the products to spy.\\xa0Ultimately, the reviews could be used to block products without explanation or to extract trade secrets in exchange for market access. Those secrets could be leaked to Chinese competitors or expose vulnerabilities, which, in turn, Chinese hackers could exploit.\\xa0Further, tech companies are concerned that the reviews could set a precedent and that other countries will follow suit, each demanding different checks that would not only be costly but also put the companies at risk of having to hand over further secrets in exchange for market access.\\n\\n\\nGoogle\\'s launch of a carpooling service\\xa0Monday marks the beginning of its seemingly inevitable entry into the ridesharing wars.

In exchange, riders will help cover the drivers\\' fuel costs. Consolidating rides means fewer cars on the road — which is better for traffic congestion and the environment, according to Waze.

It’s probably no surprise then that Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is making his first trip to the country.\\xa0Cook, who begins his multiday visit on Wednesday, will unveil a development center for digital maps in Hyderabad and introduce an accelerator program for iOS developers in Bangalore, a person with knowledge of the trip said. Apple is pushing to open its first retail stores in the country, though it’s not clear whether any discussions will be part of the CEO’s agenda on this trip.\\xa0The prize is more than 1 billion in smartphone sales in the next five years, according to researcher Counterpoint. As China’s market becomes more saturated and people across the globe upgrade their smartphones less frequently, Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and other vendors are keen to sell to India’s middle class, which is projected to quadruple to 200 million by 2020. Signs of this explosive rise in consumption already emerged in the first three months of this year, when Apple reported that shipments in India grew 56 percent, even as iPhone sales declined globally for the first time ever.\\n\\n\\nCan virtual reality translate into real profits?\\xa0A growing number of U.S. companies are counting on virtual reality for real profits.\\xa0With growth hard to come by amid the lethargic economy, companies ranging from snowmobile manufacturers to furniture sellers are incorporating virtual reality that so far has mostly been found in video games. Their bet: that the trendy headset-based technology can help them build sales and cut costs.\\xa0Theme park operator Six Flags Entertainment Corp (SIX.N) is outfitting riders on some of its aging roller coasters with Samsung VR headsets, allowing the company to brand the rides as brand-new without having to build costly new attractions. nowmobile manufacturer Arctic Cat Inc (ACAT.O) has developed virtual reality rides that customers can use to try out new models at dealerships, while eBay Inc\\'s (EBAY.O) StubHub is testing technology that allows fans to check out the view from different seats before buying tickets.\\xa0In the most recent round of corporate earnings reports, some 38 companies - including the New York Times, GoPro, and furniture-seller Wayfair - highlighted virtual reality as a part of their business plans. That was a 375 percent jump from the 8 that did so at this time last year, according to a Reuters analysis of earnings calls transcripts. Nearly all were either consumer or technology companies, suggesting that virtual reality technology has a ways to go before becoming mainstream. Yet for all of the enthusiasm, there is little evidence that virtual reality can deliver substantial growth. here are few pure plays for investors who want to buy into virtual reality.\\xa0Facebook Inc (FB.O), which paid $2 billion for its Oculus virtual reality division in 2014 and began shipping its first $599 Oculus Rift headsets in March, has the best-known virtual reality head gear, though other well-known companies including Google\\'s parent Alphabet and Apple are rumored to be working on high-powered headsets of their own. Neither company returned requests to comment. Virtual reality is such a small part of Facebook\\'s business that most analysts do not break out Oculus in their revenue or earnings estimates. Nor did Facebook give any numbers on how many Oculus headsets it expects to sell on its most recent earnings call. \"This is very early and we don\\'t expect VR to take off as a mainstream success right away ... but eventually we believe that VR is going to be the next big computing platform and we\\'re making the investments necessary to lead the way there,\" Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said.\\n\\n\\nFor online lenders, it’s suddenly touch-and-go:\\xa0\\xa0A year ago, privately held online lenders like Prosper, SoFiand Avant looked all but certain to go public at the same unicorn valuations their venture investors had assigned them — if not higher. They were seemingly reshaping the student, consumer and small business lending business. The market they’re chasing is enormous: The U.S. consumer lending market is a $3.5 trillion business, and 22 of \\xa0the largest online marketplace platforms originated just more than $5 billion of unsecured consumer credit in 2014 and more than $10 billion in 2015. They also talked a big game. When SoFi raised a whopping $1 billion from Softbank last year, CEO Michael Cagney told Bloomberg: “I’m looking at over $1 trillion of market cap from the banks, and I think it’s all vulnerable.” Fast forward to today, and it’s online lenders that suddenly look like sitting ducks. In an SEC filing yesterday, Lending Club, which announced the surprise departure of its founder and CEO last Monday, revealed that investors who “contributed a significant amount of funding” for loans are now examining that performance “or are otherwise reluctant to invest.” For many casual observers in Silicon Valley, the first signs of trouble in the online lending category emerged in late April, when the WSJ reported that Avant made $514 million worth of new loans in the U.S. in the first quarter, a 27 percent drop from the fourth quarter of 2015. Then, two weeks ago, Prosper confirmed that it planned to cut roughly 28 percent of its staff in response to falling loan volume. And Prosper’s news came just a day after OnDeck Capital said its own first-quarter losses had more than doubled as demand for its loans began to nosedive.\\xa0Of course, the kicker came last week, when Lending Club CEO Renaud LaPlanche resigned following an internal audit that turned up $22 million in loans that were sold to Jefferies yet didn’t meet the investment bank’s criteria. Smartly, some players are already looking to reimagine themselves as broader financial outfits. For example, SoFi, which began as a way for students from top universities to refinance their debt, has since branched into personal loans, wealth management and mortgages. It also said last month that it’s hoping to drum up more investor demand for the debt it originates by starting a hedge fund that will buy its own loans.\\xa0Baker expects that to survive and thrive, more online lenders may need to remodel themselves into the institutions they vowed to replace, either by becoming banks, buying or selling to banks or else striking up partnerships with banks. OnDeck and JPMorgan made one such pact. Last month, JPMorgan quietly began offering online loans to its existing small-business customers using OnDeck’s technology.\\xa0Indeed, there is a silver lining, and it’s that huge market opportunity. The trick for online lenders will be finding new ways to pursue it while remaining viable businesses.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",
      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy a staggering number of Americans have stopped using the Internet the way they used to:\\xa0Nearly one in two Internet users say privacy and security concerns have now stopped them from doing basic things online — such as posting to social networks, expressing opinions in forums or even buying things from websites, according to a new government survey released Friday.\\xa0This chilling effect, pulled out of a survey of 41,000 U.S. households who use the Internet, show the insecurity of the Web is beginning to have consequences that stretch beyond the direct fall-out of an individual losing personal data in breach. The research suggests some consumers are reaching a tipping point where they feel they can no longer trust using the Internet for everyday activities. The survey showed that nearly 20 percent of the survey\\'s respondents had personally experienced some form of identity theft, an online security breach, or another similar problem over the year before the survey was taken last July. Overall, 45 percent said their concerns about online privacy and security stopped them from using the Web in very practical ways. The NTIA survey also showed that the more connected devices people owned, the more they experienced a breach of data. For those with only one laptop or computer or smartphone, 9 percent reported a security incident. That number more than tripled for those with at least five devices.\\n\\n\\nUber China Rival Didi to Consider U.S. IPO as Soon as 2017:\\xa0Apple may not need to wait that long before it reaps the benefits of investing $1 billion in Chinese car-hailing service Didi Chuxing.\\xa0Didi is targeting an initial public offering in New York next year, according to people familiar with the matter. The timing will depend on how its battle with Uber Technologies Inc. in China plays out, said the people, who requested not to be named because the matter is private. Such a move may put the Chinese app ahead of its U.S. rival in going public, with Uber having said it wants to hold off as long as possible. China’s biggest ride-hailing app is in the process of raising about $3 billion of funding, including Apple’s $1 billion contribution, which has swelled the company’s valuation to about $26 billion, people familiar have said. Didi, already backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., has reached break even in about half of the 400 Chinese cities it operates in as Uber spends heavily to win both drivers and riders. At Didi’s current valuation, a U.S. IPO could be the biggest by a Chinese company since Alibaba’s record offering in 2014. The company is among a list of ride-sharing apps including Uber and Lyft Inc. that could conduct a public offering.\\xa0Didi hasn’t decided on which exchange and which banks to hire yet, the people said.\\xa0Didi was created last year when separate apps backed by Tencent and Alibaba merged after brutal competition drove up losses. The company now has 14 million registered drivers in China, delivering more than 11 million rides a day, and last month said it’s on track to turn an operating profit “soon.”\\n\\n\\nExclusive: Warren Buffett, Quicken Loans founder in Yahoo bid - sources:\\xa0Berkshire Hathaway Inc Chairman Warren Buffett is backing a consortium vying for Yahoo Inc\\'s internet assets that includes Quicken Loans Inc founder Dan Gilbert, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.\\xa0While there is no certainty that the consortium will prevail in the auction, the interest of Buffett and Gilbert is a boost for the Sunnyvale, California-based company, which has been surpassed in recent years by rivals such as Alphabet Inc in the race for internet users and advertising dollars.\\xa0The consortium\\'s participation in the sale process also represents a challenge to U.S. telecommunications carrier Verizon Communications Inc, whose deal to acquire AOL last year for $4.4 billion has made it a favorite to prevail in its bid for Yahoo\\'s assets among industry analysts.\\n\\n\\nAmazon is going to sell its own lines of food, detergent and diapers, and it\\'s going to be a really big deal:\\xa0Amazon is going to start selling its own brands of snacks, diapers, detergent — a move lots of traditional retailers have already made.\\xa0But Amazon isn\\'t a traditional retailer, so this move could be very meaningful for Amazon, and its competitors.\\xa0The e-commerce powerhouse will soon begin selling its own packaged goods, exclusively to Amazon Prime members under brands like Happy Belly and Mama Bear, the Wall Street Journal reports. While some people will point out that so-called \"private-labeling\" is nothing new -- grocery stores and big-box retailers have been increasingly pushing their in-house brands -- this is a much bigger deal.\\xa0That\\'s because the growth in retail is all going to be online, and Amazon owns online. It already accounts for half of all sales growth in U.S. e-commerce.\\xa0So Amazon\\'s move into consumer packaged goods gives it even more opportunity to flex its muscle with suppliers. That means giving its own products better placement on its site, and undercutting competitors on pricing.\\xa0The move also offers Amazon the chance to pad its bottom line -- something Jeff Bezos hasn\\'t traditionally been willing or able to do. Private-label brands typically carry higher profit margins , in part because the companies selling them don\\'t put big marketing campaigns behind them.\\xa0Think of the damage Amazon already does its to competitors as a low-margin business. Now imagine what happens when if it starts generating real profits on stuff like cereal and soap.\\xa0The move is also a way to increase the power of Amazon Prime, the $99-a-year unlimited shipping program that fuels Amazon\\'s retail growth.\\xa0Prime customers spend more on Amazon than non-members and are more loyal, too. By adding another perk, Amazon can make its best customers even even more loyal.\\xa0There\\'s risk here, of course. Some Amazon-branded products have already flopped, including its Amazon Element diapers, which were pulled for design flaws shortly after launch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook, Facing Bias Claims, Shows How Editors and Algorithms Guide News:\\xa0\\xa0Facebook, the largest social media network, published internal editorial guidelines on Thursday, the company’s latest attempt to rebut accusations that it is politically biased in the news content it shows on the pages of its 1.6 billion users.\\xa0The 28-page document details how both editors and computer algorithms play roles in the process of picking what should appear in the “Trending Topics” section of users’ Facebook pages.\\xa0Facebook describes a list of processes it uses to display some of the most popular content across the network, including relying on algorithms to detect up-and-coming news trends as well as a team of editors who, much like a newsroom, direct how those topics are presented and decide what should be displayed to people who regularly use the service.\\xa0As the guidelines make clear, at practically every point in the process, a human editor is given the leeway to exercise his or her editorial influence.\\xa0The document was released just days after a report on the tech news siteGizmodo said Facebook editors had intentionally “suppressed” news topics from conservative publications trending across the network. The report also said editors were able to artificially inflate the importance of other topics by “injecting” them into the Trending section of users’ Facebook pages.\\xa0Since those claims surfaced, Facebook has been questioned by news sites across the political spectrum and by legislators in Washington. On Thursday, critics urged the company to consider the biases of its editors.\\xa0“As long as Facebook is hiring editors who lean left politically, those stories are going to get preferential treatment,” Erick Erickson, former editor in chief of the conservative website RedState and founder of another conservative site called The Resurgent, said in an email. “I’d hope that Facebook would take care to consider all views and all news.”\\xa0The company has continued to deny accusations of political bias and pointed to editorial rules that discourage Trending Topics staff members from taking one viewpoint or another.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba Bears Retreat as Sales Growth Endures China Slump: Chart:\\xa0Bearish bets against Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. have dropped to the lowest level since January after the Chinese e-commerce leader’s quarterly revenue beat analysts’ forecasts even as the nation’s economy grows at the slowest pace in 25 years. Short interest fell to 7.1 percent this week after peaking at a two-year high of 8.5 percent two months ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Markit Ltd. The U.S.-traded stock has risen 4.4 percent since the company reported its quarterly results, while its main competitor JD.com Inc. tumbled 12 percent after reporting a slowdown in sales volume.\\n\\n\\nIntel Sells $2.75 Billion of Bonds to Refinance 2016 Debt:\\xa0Intel Corp. sold $2.75 billion of bonds on Thursday to refinance debt due this year and a portion of notes maturing in 2017.\\xa0The world’s biggest chipmaker issued debt three parts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The longest portion was $1.25 billion of 30-year notes yielding 1.55 percentage points above comparable government debt. That’s down from an initial offer of 1.7 percentage points, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. managed the sale.S&P Global Ratings gave the bonds an A+ grade, according to a statement on Thursday. Intel is the latest U.S. blue-chip company to offer notes in what’s poised to be second-busiest week for issuance this year. In its last multibillion-dollar deal, Intel sold $7 billion of bonds in July to finance part of its $16.7 billion takeover of Altera Corp. The company plans to repay its $1.5 billion of 1.95 percent notes due in October and a portion of the $3 billion of 1.35 percent bonds due next year.\\xa0Investment-grade companies have sold more than $49 billion worth of bonds so far this week as they take advantage of low borrowing costs after posting earnings for the quarter ended March 31. Companies are also front-loading issuance before the summer slowdown, according to Ben Emons, a money manager at Leader Capital Corp. in Los Angeles.\\n\\n\\nApple invests $1 billion in Chinese Uber rival ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing:\\xa0Apple said on Thursday it has invested $1 billion in Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing, a move that Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said would help the company better understand the critical Chinese market.\\xa0The investment comes as Apple is trying to reinvigorate sales in China, its second-largest market. Apple recently has come under pressure from Chinese regulators, with its online book and film services shut down last month, and Cook is traveling to the country this month.\\xa0The investment gives Apple, which has hired dozens of automotive experts over the past year, a sizeable stake in Uber Technologies Inc\\'s chief rival in China. Cook said in an interview that he sees opportunities for Apple and Didi Chuxing to collaborate in the future.\\n\\n\\nStrong demand for graphics chips to boost Nvidia\\'s revenue:\\xa0Nvidia Corp forecast better-than-expected revenue for the current quarter as it sees robust demand for its chips that power complex computer graphics.\\xa0Shares of the company, which also reported profit and revenue above analysts\\' estimates, were up 7.5 percent in extended trading.\\xa0The chipmaker last week unveiled its GeForce GTX 1080 and 1070 graphics processors based on its Pascal technology.Revenue from its gaming business, which designs graphics cards such as GeForce for PCs, rose 17 percent to $687 million.\\xa0The company has weathered a shrinking personal computer industry by focusing on game enthusiasts, who are willing to pay hundreds of dollars for processors used in playing graphically demanding games.Revenue from its data center business, which includes its Tesla processors, rose 62.5 percent to $143 million.Nvidia\\'s net income rose to $196 million, or 33 cents per share, in the first quarter ended May 1 from $134 million, or 24 cents per share, a year earlier.\\xa0Excluding items, the company earned 46 cents per share, handily beating analysts\\' expectations of 32 cents.\\xa0Revenue rose 13.4 percent to $1.31 billion, while analysts were expecting $1.26 billion.\\xa0The company also said it intends to return about $1 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2017 through quarterly dividends and share buybacks.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat happened when a professor built a chatbot to be his teaching assistant:\\xa0To help with his class this spring, a Georgia Tech professor hired Jill Watson, a teaching assistant unlike any other in the world. Throughout the semester, she answered questions online for students, relieving the professor’s overworked teaching staff.\\xa0But, in fact, Jill Watson was an artificial intelligence bot.\\xa0Ashok Goel, a computer science professor, did not reveal Watson’s true identity to students until after they’d turned in their final exams.\\xa0Students were amazed. “I feel like I am part of history because of Jill and this class!” wrote one in the class’s online forum. “Just when I wanted to nominate Jill Watson as an outstanding TA in the CIOS survey!” said another.\\xa0Now Goel is forming a business to bring the chatbot to the wider world of education. While he doesn’t foresee the chatbot replacing teaching assistants or professors, he expects the chatbot’s question-answering abilities to be an invaluable asset for massive online open courses, where students often drop out and generally don’t receive the chance to engage with a human instructor. With more human-like interaction, Goel expects online learning could become more appealing to students and lead to better educational outcomes. At the start of this semester Goel provided his students with a list of nine teaching assistants, including Jill, the automated question and answering service Goel developed with the help of some of his students and IBM.\\xa0Goel and his teaching assistants receive more than 10,000 questions a semester from students on the course’s online forum. Sometimes the same questions are asked again and again. Last spring he began to wonder if he could automate the burden of answering so many repetitive questions.\\xa0As Goel looked for a technology that could help, he settled on IBM Watson, which he had used for several other projects. Watson, an artificial intelligence system, was designed to answer questions, so it seemed like a strong fit. To train the system to answer questions correctly, Goel fed it forum posts from the class’s previous semesters. This gave Jill an extensive background in common questions and how they should be answered.\\xa0Goel tested the system privately for months, having his teaching assistants examine whether Jill’s answers were correct. Initially the system struggled with similar questions such as “Where can I find assignment two?” and “When is assignment two due?” Goel tweaked the software, adding more layers of decision-making to it. Eventually Jill reached the point where its answers were good enough. The system is only allowed to answer questions if it calculates that it is 97 percent or more confident in its answer. Goel found that was the threshold at which he could guarantee the system was accurate.\\xa0There are many questions Jill can’t handle. Those questions were reserved for human teaching assistants.\\xa0Goel plans to use Jill again in a class this fall, but will likely change its name so students have the challenge of guessing which teaching assistant isn’t human.\\n\\n\\nCowen: It Looks Even More Like Amazon Will Become America\\'s Top Clothing Retailer in 2017:\\xa0It\\'s been a tough few weeks for retailers, and today is no different. But there is one exception: Amazon.com Inc. Whereas XRT, the SPDR S&P Retail ETF is down over 4 percent, \\xa0Amazon shares are up over 2 percent.\\xa0One driver of the retail selloff is Macy\\'s, whose earnings report sent shares tumbling this morning after the retailer cut profit forecasts and missed analyst estimates on revenue. That\\'s the opposite of what happened to Amazon last week when the web giantblew past analyst estimates. Given this recent action in the retail space, analysts at Cowen and Company are reiterating their call for Amazon to displace Macy\\'s as the number one U.S. apparel retailer by next year.\\xa0\"[Our calculation] implies a gain in U.S. Apparel & Accessories market share from 5 percent to 14 percent,\" the team, led by John Blackledge write in their note, adding, \"We have seen a continued shift away from more traditional retailers...In the first quarter of 2016, Amazon Apparel purchasers were up ~19 percent year-over-year, while Apparel purchasers fell ~1 percent year-over-year and ~5 percent year-over-year at Wal-Mart and Target, respectively.\"\\xa0The team previously made this call in July of 2015, saying they were confident that Macy\\'s would lose its top spot within two years.\\xa0Looking at revenue from electronics and general merchandise at Amazon, the trend is obvious. Amazon has seen continued growth in its retail business with the expansion of its Prime offerings. Their stock prices have certainly reflected these trends. Amazon is up 65 percent over the past year, whiles Macy\\'s is down more than 50 percent.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle’s answer to Amazon\\'s Echo is code-named ‘Chirp’ and is landing soon:\\xa0A product team at Google is working on a hardware device that would integrate Google\\'s search and voice assistant technology, akin to the Amazon Echo, Recode has learned.\\xa0Google\\'s device will resemble its OnHub wireless router, according to several sources. We don\\'t know if it has a name yet, but internally the project goes by \"Chirp.\"\\xa0Google declined to comment. The Information previously reported that Google was plotting a competing version of Echo, a portable speaker with voice assistant tech. Sources said the device is unlikely to launch next week at Google\\'s I/O developer conference, but plans are for it to land at some point this year.\\xa0We should, however, get a peek at it and its potential next week — voice search and intelligent personal assistance will occupy center stage at the company\\'s splash show, along with virtual reality.\\xa0Google has long had voice assistant tech in its Android phones — beckoned by the words \"Okay, Google\" — that many in the industry see as leading the pack. (People inside Google think so, too.) But it has yet to bake that into the home, a key growing marketing for Google and its rivals. Its OnHub router, released last summer, does not have voice recognition capabilities.\\xa0Amazon, on the other hand, has moved headlong into the home with Echo. One analyst estimated that Amazon has sold three million units.\\xa0And Echo is collecting the type of data — what consumers search for, listen to and buy, and how they talk to machines — that Google loves. Amazon has long been considered a big threat to Google\\'s core business as web and mobile app users go to the online retailer for product searches.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon and YouTube get ready to rumble over online video:\\xa0\\xa0Amazon is moving into the space long held by YouTube, announcing on Tuesday thelaunch of a new platform that allows anyone to post original content.\\xa0Called \"Amazon Video Direct,\" the site offers creators a way to make money in a variety of ways, including royalties on videos streamed by paying Amazon Prime members, revenue shares for videos rented or purchased, ad impressions for free-to-watch videos, and any combination of these models. The new platform places Amazon in direct competition with Google\\'s YouTube, the firm leader in the video upload space that counts 1 billion users. YouTube has its own revenue sharing model for its top creators. Starting in 2007, it launched its Partners Program, which gave popular content creators a cut of the ad revenue earned from views to their pages.\\xa0But there has been controversy in connection with the cut that YouTube takes, which is 45% of the revenue, and the site does not offer to cover any video creation costs, leading some YouTube creators to speak out about comparatively unfair profits.\\xa0Amazon has not yet detailed what percentage of revenue creators will get with the Video Direct service. But it is offering a pay-to-subscribe option direct to each individual channel, similar to Twitch, which allows users to “follow” specific content creators for a fee. The owner of the channel would make a percentage of the profit from those subscriptions. Amazon will also pay out $1 million as a bonus among the creators of the top 100 videos viewed by Prime members each month.\\n\\n\\nThree More Signs Smartphone Downturn Is Going From Bad to Worse:\\xa0Three suppliers that seldom command much attention, working behind the scenes to make devices sold under the brands of better-known customers, put out back-to-back earnings reports Tuesday. They spell trouble ahead for smartphone makers and other companies that once thrived on mobile mania.\\xa0Pegatron Corp., which assembles iPhones, missed profit expectations and said April sales dived 16 percent. Minebea Co., which makes LED lights for mobiles, lagged its own forecasts for revenue and earnings. Japan Display Inc., which supplies screens to Apple and others, said profit has deteriorated so rapidly it will lose money for the fiscal year and suspend a promised dividend. Adding to the gloom, Lenovo Group Ltd. tumbled to a four-year low as analysts warned of rising competition. Pegatron and its peers are merely the latest in a string of ill omens for a market facing its worst pace of expansion since Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007. Much of the gloom centers on China, the phenomenal growth engine that’s now headed for an epicshakeout. Smartphones are no longer a novelty and most domestic brands target the mid- and low-price ranges, where buyers don’t upgrade as frequently as those for high-end Apple and Samsung phones.\\n\\n\\nWhatsApp launches desktop apps for Mac and Windows:\\xa0WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned messaging service that claims a billion users, has launched desktop clients for Mac and Windows. The release comes about 15 months after WhatsApp released its first web app.\\xa0People who have already been using WhatsApp on their web browsers will find that software isn’t significantly different. The company said in an announcement “our desktop app is simply an extension of your phone,” with all messages synced between devices.\\xa0WhatsApp’s success in countries like India, Brazil, and South Africa is of course driven by the high penetration of smartphones in those markets, but giving power users–including people who rely on WhatsApp for work communications–desktop options helps it competes against other messaging services, like iMessenger, WeChat, and Skype. WhatsApp is currently testing out B2C accounts, which would give it a new revenue source after dropping its 99 cent annual subscription fee.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReport claiming bias in Facebook \\'trending\\' topics sparks social media outcry:\\xa0Facebook workers have often omitted conservative political stories from the website’s \"trending\" list, the technology news site Gizmodo said on Monday in a report that sparked widespread comment on social media.\\xa0An unnamed former Facebook employee told Gizmodo that workers \"routinely suppressed news stories of interest to conservative readers,\" according to Gizmodo, while \"artificially\" adding other stories into the trending list.\\xa0Facebook told Reuters on Monday that there are \"rigorous guidelines in place\" to maintain neutrality and said that these guidelines do not prohibit any news outlet from appearing in trending topics.\\xa0Facebook did not respond directly though to questions about whether employees had suppressed conservative-leaning news.\\xa0\"These guidelines do not permit the suppression of political perspectives. Nor do they permit the prioritization of one viewpoint over another or one news outlet over another,\" a spokesperson for Facebook said.\\xa0The report alarmed some social media users, with several journalists and commentators criticizing Facebook for alleged bias.\\xa0\"Aside from fueling right-wing persecution, this is a key reminder of dangers of Silicon Valley controlling content,\" tweeted journalist Glenn Greenwald.\\xa0Well, you go to Hell, Facebook,\" tweeted Kyle Feldscher (@Kyle_Feldscher), a reporter at the Washington Examiner, a conservative-leaning publication.\\xa0\"For anyone who cares about press freedom, this is frightening stuff,\" tweeted Bloomberg Editor Bill Grueskin (@BGrueskin), with a link to Gizmodo\\'s story.\\n\\n\\nAs Lending Club Stumbles, Its Entire Industry Faces Skepticism:\\xa0Renaud Laplanche and his crew steered a 105-foot racing boat through New York Harbor one day last spring, its towering sails ripping across the water at 30 knots.\\xa0An accomplished sailor and founder of Lending Club, Mr. Laplanche was hosting executives from hedge funds, Goldman Sachs and other banks — part of his effort to win over Wall Street on his plans to upend traditional banking with a faster, more democratic form of lending.\\xa0He already had endorsements from Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary, and John Mack, the former chief of Morgan Stanley, who joined his board. At Lending Club’s initial public offering in December 2014, the company was valued at over $8 billion.\\xa0But on Monday, Lending Club announced that Mr. Laplanche had resigned after an internal investigation found improprieties in its lending process, including the altering of millions of dollars’ worth of loans. The company’s stock price, already reeling in recent months, fell 34 percent.\\xa0The company’s woes are part of a broader reckoning in the online money-lending industry. Last week, Prosper, another online lender that focuses on consumers, laid off more than a quarter of its work force, and the chief executive said he was forgoing his salary for the year. Marketplace lenders like Lending Club have created easy-to-use websites that match consumers and small businesses, hoping to borrow a few thousand dollars, with individuals or Wall Street investors looking to lend money.\\xa0Freed from the costs of brick-and-mortar branches and federal regulations requiring that they reserve money against their loans, marketplace lenders have been able to grow quickly and with fewer expenses.\\xa0The process is almost entirely online, with loans approved in days rather than the weeks a traditional bank might take.\\xa0While marketplace loans account for less than 1 percent of the consumer loans in the United States, a recent report by the investment bank Jefferies said that in some segments — like installment loans — the new lending companies account for more than 10 percent of the market. But in the first quarter, lenders like Lending Club, Prosper and OnDeck Capital had difficulty convincing investors that their business models are sound. Wall Street’s waning demand for loans exposed the Achilles’ heel of marketplace lending. Unlike traditional banks that use their deposits to fund loans, the marketplace companies discovered how fleeting their funding sources can be.\\n\\n\\nResearchers say computer screens change how you think about what you read:\\xa0You probably spend a lot of time staring at screens -- but all that computer time may be making you miss the big picture, new research has found.\\xa0Reading something on a screen -- as opposed to a printout -- causes people to home in on details and but not broader ideas, according to a new article by Geoff Kaufman. a professor at Carnegie Mellon, and Mary Flanagan, a professor at Dartmouth. \\xa0\"Digital screens almost seem to create a sort of tunnel vision where you\\'re focusing on just the information you\\'re getting this moment, not the broader context,\" Kaufman said.\\xa0The article is based on a series of studies involving a total of more than 300 participants that were carried out while the two researchers worked together at Tiltfactor, a Dartmouth game design lab. The studies covered in the latest article were prompted by earlier research from Kaufman and Flanagan that found players using the iPad version of a disease prevention strategy game struggled with long-term strategy much more than those playing a physical copy of the game.\\n\\n\\nZenefits Was the Perfect Startup. Then It Self-Disrupted:\\xa0Zenefits makes online software that automates health insurance, payroll, and other essential office drudgery—kind of a human resources version of TurboTax. It’s not a sexy idea, but with 6 million small businesses in the U.S., it’s enormously useful. The company was founded in 2013 by Parker Conrad, who realized he could streamline small businesses’ managerial needs, saving them hundreds of hours of mind-numbing paperwork—not to mention the cost of staffing an HR department—by putting everything online. Conrad was known to be a little frenzied and disorganized but fiercely intelligent. “From an investment philosophy\\u2009…\\u2009we look for the magnitude of the genius, as opposed to the lack of issues,” says Andreessen’s founding partner Ben Horowitz. “And in a way, [Conrad] was like the prototype.” Conrad had no background in health insurance but quickly learned the intricacies of the business as well as any veteran. “If you’re an insurance broker,” he said at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in 2013, “we’re going to drink your milkshake.” \\xa0Then In California, they found, some of the sales team used Conrad’s macro to systematically cheat on the state’s training course, which included a section on ethics. “As far as a company doing what Zenefits has done, I don’t know that we have seen this before,” says Nancy Kincaid, press secretary for the California Department of Insurance, which has also opened an investigation. In March, Massachusetts’ division of insurance opened a third. Zenefits confirms that other states have since followed but won’t say which ones or even how many. Sacks became CEO and is guiding Zenefits through its crisis cleanup. He has banned alcohol at the office and changed the company motto from “Ready. Fire. Aim.” to “Operate With Integrity.” In February the company laid off 250 employees, including the enterprise team. Sales Vice President Blond, Semaan’s boss, and any executive or manager known to have helped disseminate the macro are also gone. Zenefits says it has self-reported the findings of its internal investigation to all 50 states and is working with those that have opened formal inquiries. Fidelity Investments, which owns a stake, has slashed its valuation of Zenefits from $4.5 billion to less than $2 billion. There are rows of empty desks at the San Francisco office; the company plans to downsize from four floors to three. The Star Wars-themed conference rooms will soon be renamed after inspirational entrepreneurs. Kegs have been replaced with cold-brew coffee. The stairwells are condom-free. Zenefits might also survive for the one reason that made its product so appealing to business owners in the first place: Shopping for health insurance remains really frustrating. The company says it now has 20,000 accounts. “As long as their problems don’t affect our company, we’ll stay,” says Todd Harmond, vice president for finance and operations of the e-book service Scribd, which uses Zenefits to offer Kaiser Permanente and Anthem health insurance plans to its 85 employees.\\xa0“Unless something else goes really wrong with Zenefits, we’ll stick with them for a while,” says BlogMutt’s Yates. “It’s too much of a hassle to switch.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Do Consumers Want? Look at Their Selfies:\\xa0Allison Shragal, 28, of Chicago, isn’t a model, or Internet famous — she’s an administrative assistant for a general contracting company. But almost every day companies pay her to snap photos of herself engaging in routine activities — brushing her teeth, eating breakfast, cleaning the bathroom.\\xa0Her seemingly mundane images, when combined with thousands of others, contain insights that companies like Crest are eager to mine. They are using a Chicago-based company called Pay Your Selfie to gather those insights and present them in reports on consumer behavior that are meant to go where focus groups and surveys cannot.\\xa0Among the tidbits that Crest, owned by Procter & Gamble, learned from its recent monthlong quest for selfies: There’s a huge spike in brushing from 4 to 6 p.m., probably tied to a desire for happy-hour fresh breath. That knowledge could be useful when Crest decides which times of the day to start future social media campaigns.\\xa0Users of the app receive anywhere from 20 cents to $1 for each “task” completed — in Crest’s case, a snapshot taken “while brushing your teeth with your favorite Crest product.” Users can’t double-dip; the app allows only one selfie per task.\\xa0The selfies are a good way for companies to obtain information that people can’t or don’t articulate in focus groups or other traditional research methods, said Ravi Dhar, director of the Center for Customer Insights at the Yale School of Management. For example, they could lead to an understanding of which rituals go along with certain types of consumption, he said.\\xa0Pay Your Selfie, which has been in business since last September, doesn’t require participants to have followers on a site like Instagram. In fact, users don’t have to share their images publicly at all (although they can). That makes it different from a company like Popular Pays, which offers Instagrammers the chance to post about brands like Nike in exchange for giveaways or cash.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCompanies are betting on a new way to protect your identity: the selfie:\\xa0The selfie is about to get serious. Already ubiquitous at parties and for capturing Instagram-worthy landscapes, the act of raising a phone to your face and finding the perfect photo angle could take on a whole new role in people’s finances. Some banks, tax agencies and tech companies are making the selfie an integral step for people checking their bank accounts, shopping online and filing tax returns. Forced to find creative ways to guard against the rising threat of identity theft, a growing number of companies are moving from a system that tests people on what they know, such as a password. Now they want to ask consumers to provide evidence of something that can’t easily be changed or copied: their face. \\xa0A photo also can serve as a way for consumers to offer proof that it was indeed them — and not an imposter — \\xa0who made that purchase or submitted that form. For instance, MasterCard plans to roll out a service nicknamed “Selfie Pay” this summer through its member banks. Through the program, consumers would shop online as usual and after checking out, they would confirm the purchase by taking a selfie with a MasterCard mobile app. And Georgia will roll out a pilot program for the next tax season at the end of the year that gives taxpayers the option of creating a secure account where they verify their identities by taking a photo. If there is a match, taxpayers will be asked take a photo on their smartphones before their tax returns can be processed, ensuring the return was not submitted by a fraudster. To overcome that risk, the companies are requiring selfies that are a little different than the ones you might see on Facebook. After finding the right angle, consumers are asked to move around to confirm that the camera is capturing a live person and not a photo. In the MasterCard and USAA programs, users are told when to blink. Georgia’s tax program will prompt people to position their faces a certain way and scan for motion. \\xa0\\n\\n\\nAlexaSite wins the Disrupt NY 2016 Hackathon Grand Prize:\\xa0AlexaSite lets designers update websites using their voice.

In 2015, Palantir generated $420 million in revenue, BuzzFeed reported, citing interviews with former and current employees, as well as more than 1,000 internal e-mails and documents. The secretive big data company spent more than $500 million last year, the report said. A spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Palantir’s bookings, which refer to the value of contracts that typically span many years, exceeded $1 billion in 2014 and continued growing in 2015, a person with knowledge of the matter said last year. BuzzFeed reported Palantir bookings of $1.7 billion in 2015. American Express Co., Coca-Cola Co. and Nasdaq Inc. were among the companies that walked away from contracts with Palantir over the last year or so, BuzzFeed reported. Hershey Co. is reevaluating its relationship with Palantir, and Kimberly-Clark Corp. considered becoming a customer before deciding that Palantir’s high prices were unjustified, the report said.\\xa0Palantir also counts Axa SA, Bridgewater Associates LP, Credit Suisse Group AG and First Data Corp. among its clients. Its biggest customer is BP Plc, which signed an agreement with Palantir in November 2014 worth $1.2 billion over 10 years, plus bonus payments as determined by executives from both companies, according to BuzzFeed.\\xa0Employee defections accelerated early this year, and at the current pace, the attrition rate this year would be 20 percent, BuzzFeed reported. The departure rate in 2015 was 14 percent and 12 percent in 2014, the report said.\\n\\n\\nReliance on China health sector raises searching questions for Baidu:\\xa0The death of a student following experimental cancer treatment he found through China\\'s biggest search engine, Baidu Inc, has exposed the faultlines in the company\\'s business model, which relies heavily on income from the country\\'s lightly regulated health sector. Before his death, student Wei Zexi, 21, criticized the military-run hospital that provided the failed treatment for misleading claims about its effectiveness and accused Baidu, which controls 80 percent of the Chinese search market, of promoting false medical information. Baidu has come in for fierce online criticism for how it handles adverts within its search results, especially from an industry as sensitive as healthcare, which analysts at Nomura and Daiwa say provides 20 to 30 percent of its search revenues.\\xa0In 2015 search revenues were 55.7 billion yuan ($8.6 billion), or 84 percent of Baidu\\'s total sales.\\xa0\"Whatever page you\\'re looking at on Baidu is a mess of adverts,\" said username FreedLiu on China\\'s Weibo microblog, discussing Wei. \"They\\'re profiting from loads of people who don\\'t know Baidu auctions (its search results).\"\\xa0Baidu said it applied particular vigilance to healthcare customers, with screening for misleading adverts and a verification program with additional scrutiny for medical advertisers. Criticism in several state media outlets this week suggests a hardening attitude in government.\\xa0\"Pursuing profits is not wrong, but putting profits over helpless patients\\' lives is against any ethical standards,\" said a column in the official People\\'s Daily on Monday.\\xa0Any decision by authorities to restrict healthcare advertising could have a material impact on Baidu\\'s earnings, a concern that has contributed to a sharp fall in its shares in the last three sessions.\\xa0Daiwa said 10-15 percent of Baidu\\'s search revenue could evaporate under a worst-case scenario.Like most search engines, Baidu places paid-for ads in its search results, but in a series of Reuters search tests it included at least twice as many ads as Alphabet Inc\\'s Google, which is blocked in China, and placed them higher in its list.\\xa0Though Baidu marks such items as promotions, Google also highlights the word \"Ad\" in a yellow box.\\n\\n\\nApple\\'s Tim Cook to visit China for government meetings - source:\\xa0Tim Cook plans to visit Beijing later this month to meet high-level government officials, at a time when it is facing some setbacks in its most important overseas market, a source familiar with the matter said.\\xa0Cook has frequently traveled to China since taking the helm of Apple five years ago, but his latest visit comes during a critical period.\\xa0From weakening smartphone sales to the loss of an iPhone trademark dispute and the suspension of some of its online entertainment services, the U.S. technology giant has been facing a flurry of problems in recent weeks in its second-largest market after the United States.\\xa0That has raised concerns over Apple\\'s growth momentum, as the company reported last week its first quarterly revenue drop in 13 years.\\xa0Last week, billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn said in an interview with cable television network CNBC that he had sold his entire stake in Apple, citing China\\'s economic slowdown and worries about whether the government could make it very difficult for Apple to conduct business.During his China visit, Cook plans to meet senior government and Communist Party leaders - including officials in charge of propaganda, said the source, who declined to be named as the plan is not public yet.\\n\\n\\nGoPro delays its highly anticipated drone until winter:\\xa0GoPro announced its first-quarter earnings today, and the details were fairly bleak. It saw its revenue drop by 49.5 percent from the same period in 2015, and it swung from a $22 million profit to a $121 million loss. The company also announced that its new drone, the Karma, will be delayed until the winter holiday. It was originally slated to be released in the first half of this year.\\xa0The news comes after a disappointing year for GoPro. While the company shipped more cameras than ever before in 2015 (6.6 million), GoPro had a rough fourth quarter, bringing in about $200 million less than it did in the fourth quarter of 2014.\\n\\n\\nWhat 25 hours in virtual reality feels like:\\xa0A Los Angeles writer set a world record after spending 25 hours playing a single game in virtual reality.\\xa0Derek Westerman, 32, took on the challenge after trying virtual reality for the first time earlier this year. Westerman was left wondering how long anyone could last in an experience that he considered intense and overwhelming.\\xa0When Westerman found out there was no world record for time spent in a virtual reality headset, Westerman pitched the stunt to Super Deluxe, a maker of comedic YouTube videos.\\xa0For the challenge Westerman spent the 25 hours making three-dimensional artwork in a game called Tilt Brush. Each hour Westerman would start a new painting, and shift between standing, sitting down or lying on the floor. Westerman, who ultimately said it was a great experience, hasn’t worn a virtual reality headset since setting the world record a month ago. For 24 hours after the experience Westerman said that everything looked uncanny. Spending a day in virtual reality changed how his brain registered space. Objects in the distance looked odd, as if they weren’t real. Human senses are capable of adapting well to new and different circumstances, according to University of Maryland professor Amitabh Varshney, who leads its virtual reality research efforts. Varshney recalled an experiment in which an Australian professor outfitted his assistant with glasses that inverted his vision, turning the world upside down. While initially confused, before long he was able to perform everyday tasks such as ride a bicycle.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

But, not all of Alibaba\\'s businesses looked rosy.\\xa0Its online finance affiliate Ant Financial Services Group, one of founder Jack Ma\\'s crown jewels in his e-commerce empire, recorded a net loss in the quarter.\\xa0That business has spent heavily on its intense competition with WeChat Payment, one of the world\\'s largest payments systems and owned by Alibaba arch-rival Tencent Holdings.\\xa0Ant, which houses the massive Alipay online payment platform, is now valued at $60 billion and is gearing up for an IPO, despite the fact it is now losing money. Alibaba did not disclose how much Ant lost. Alibaba\\'s revenues rose to 24.2 billion yuan ($3.7 billion) in the quarter ended March 31 from 17.4 billion yuan a year earlier. Gross merchandise volume (GMV), or the total value of goods transacted on its platforms on China retail marketplaces, rose 24 percent to 742 billion yuan. The previous quarter it had risen 22.5 percent - the slowest pace on record.\\n\\n\\nDorsey\\'s Square posts bigger-than-expected loss as costs surge:\\xa0Square Inc, the mobile payments company run by Twitter Inc Chief Executive Jack Dorsey, reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss on Thursday as costs surged, sending its shares sharply lower in after-hours trading. Slowing growth at formerly fast-growing Square Capital, which lends to small merchants, also aroused concerns. The company said Square Capital lent $153 million in the first quarter, up just 4 percent from the preceding quarter, largely due to \"more challenging credit market conditions.\" The business acts as a middleman to offer funds to customers who can\\'t otherwise borrow easily. Most funds are arranged by Square through third parties, who commit to buy the future receivables. \"Lenders are no longer wanting to finance alternative lending,\" said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. Square loses $2 for every $1 of hardware sales, Luria said. \"The growth is coming from the wrong places.\" Square, which went public in November, facilitates payments between businesses and customers with a credit card reader that turns any mobile phone into a payment terminal. The company also makes point-of-sale registers and chip-enabled card readers. Square\\'s shares were down 12.3 percent at $11.44 in after-hours trading despite several bright spots in the results.\\xa0The company\\'s net revenue jumped 51.4 percent and gross payment volume - the total dollar amount of all card payments processed by sellers - jumped 45 percent to $10.3 billion.\\xa0Square also raised its annual adjusted revenue projection to $615 million-$635 million from $600 million-$620 million.\\xa0But its net loss attributable to common stockholders widened to $96.8 million from $48 million in the same period a year ago as operating expenses jumped 72 percent to $207 million.\\n\\n\\n\\nSAP announces new partnership with Apple to expand iOS in the enterprise:\\xa0\\xa0SAP announced a broad partnership with Apple today to bring iOS to SAP’s enterprise customer base. The announcement comes almost two years after Apple made a similar deal with IBM.\\xa0Steve Lucas, president for SAP’s Digital Enterprise Platform says while it’s natural to see similarities between the two deals — two large enterprise companies making a deal with Apple — he says there are major differences.\\xa0For starters, he says SAP is firmly an enterprise software company and it has built a cloud platform to access all of the software it has developed, whether its core ERP product, SuccessFactors or Concur. He says having that core certainly is a differentiating factor in his view.\\xa0Still there are similarities too. As with IBM, SAP has been working closely with Apple to bring its profound design sense to this endeavor. The objective of this partnership is no less than to revolutionize work on the iPad and iPhone, Lucas says.\\xa0It’s no secret that Apple wants a bigger piece of the enterprise market and these kinds of agreements help solidify their enterprise position and drive Apple hardware sales inside companies that were traditionally PC shops — and hence more often considered Microsoft territory. Finally, much like IBM it wouldn’t be a deal without an educational component to round it out, so SAP is also offering SAP Academy for iOS as a training ground for SAP programmers to learn to use the HANA iOS SDK. Lucas says the company is absolutely committed to this educational effort and it’s not something they will announce and go away in a few months, but a program that he sees lasting well into the future.\\xa0While you might not see a natural fit between SAP and Apple, when the IBM partnership was launched in 2014, it certainly raised some eyebrows too, but by the end of last year the partnership had created 100 apps — and that number has surely increased since then.\\xa0In fact, SAP is also planning on building 100 apps. The apps and the SDK are not yet available, but they say they should start to trickle out in Beta later this year. Many of the apps are in progress, according to Lucas, but they are not ready to ship yet.\\xa0Apple also signed a partnership with Cisco last summer.\\n\\n\\n\\nTesla Falls on Cash Concerns, Doubt About Manufacturing Goals:\\xa0Tesla Motors Inc. fell Thursday after the company, aiming to dramatically boost production, withdrew its projection to generate more cash than it uses this year and said it will probably need to raise capital.\\xa0Shares in the electric-car maker fell 4.9 percent to $211.71 at 1:28 p.m. New York time. The shares had surged late Wednesday and early Thursday after Tesla moved ahead by two years its target date for reaching annual production of 500,000 vehicles before sinking on skepticism about the ambitious assembly goals and concerns about cash.\\xa0Tesla said in a letter to shareholders Wednesday that to meet the new production target, capital expenditures this year will probably be about $750 million more than the $1.5 billion originally planned. A capital raise of about $2 billion would dilute current owners by about 7 percent, UBS analyst Colin Langan wrote in a note.\\n\\n\\nNetflix reveals what images hook viewers on new shows:\\xa0Netflix has found that its viewers spend only 1.8 seconds considering whether to watch a show or movie that is presented to them. With so little time to make a successful pitch to potential viewers, the company has become obsessed with making it easy for members to make a quick decision about whether a show is interesting.\\xa0For Netflix that means perfecting the promotional artwork — imagery that runs alongside an explanation of the show. Members spend 82 percent of their time focusing on artwork while browsing Netflix, according to the company.\\xa0This week Netflix released new findings about the power of the images its presents to viewers while introducing them to shows, and what traits in an image can encourage a viewer to watch a show.\\xa0Netflix finds that images with expressive facial emotion that convey the tone of the show do well. Artwork featuring recognizable or polarizing characters also succeed. Even if a show has an ensemble cast, when it comes to promotional purposes — someone needs to hog the spotlight.\\xa0“While ensemble casts are fantastic for a huge billboard on the side of a highway, they are too complex at small sizes and ultimately not as effective at helping our members decide if the title is right for them on smaller screens,” explained Netflix’s Nick Nelson in the blog post.\\xa0While the Netflix show “Orange Is the New Black” featured eight cast members in its Season 1 image, Netflix scaled back to a single character for seasons 2 and 3.\\xa0Netflix reached these conclusions through what’s called A/B testing, in which audiences are split into groups and shown different images. Analysts then gauge how audiences respond to the different options.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia rejects Apple\\'s plan to import used iPhones:\\xa0India has rejected a plan by Apple Inc to import used iPhones, government officials said on Wednesday, a blow to the U.S. tech giant that has been seeking to revive waning sales of its flagship smartphones.\\xa0Apple sells what it calls refurbished iPhones at a discount in some countries, including the United States. Extending this practice to India would have likely helped it increase its share in one of the world\\'s fastest growing smartphone markets against competitors with much cheaper offerings.\\xa0But India, which is pushing a \\'Make in India\\' initiative to boost the competitiveness of its manufacturing sector, rejected the proposal citing rules against importing used electronics.\\xa0Apple\\'s proposal was opposed by domestic phone makers who claim selling refurbished iPhones - devices that have been returned by buyers or repaired to factory condition after damage - would breach India\\'s anti-dumping rules. The Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association had written to India\\'s telecom ministry to stall the move. The news comes at a time when Apple posted its first-ever drop in iPhone sales amid weakness in China, its most important market after the United States.\\xa0In India, Apple only has about a 2 percent market share but its sales there surged 56 percent in the first three months, driven mainly by cheaper older-generation devices such as the iPhone 5S while demand for the new iPhone SE disappointed.\\xa0\"The 5S\\' success in India has more to do with affordability of a premium brand than a preference for smaller phones, and the move to the more expensive SE will discourage budget buyers,\" said Wilmer Ang, an analyst at research firm Canalys.\\xa0The newly launched iPhone SE retails at 39,000 rupees ($585) in India - almost $200 higher than its U.S. price.\\xa0To successfully tap into India\\'s smartphone boom - where sales are expected to grow 25 percent this year - Apple will need a better retail presence and cheaper versions of the iPhone given the average smartphone in the country sells for less than$150, according to analysts.\\xa0Apple, which currently retails in India through local partners, is already seeking government approval to set up its first store in the country.\\n\\n\\nTesla\\'s Wild New Forecast Would Change the Trajectory of an Entire Industry - If Met:\\xa0Tesla just took the most ambitious automotive production timeline since the Ford Model T and moved it up two years. The company now plans to produce 500,000 electric cars every year starting in 2018. That\\'s 10 times the number of vehicles it produced in 2015, and enough to ensure that all 400,000 customers who put down a $1,000 deposit on the forthcoming Model 3 will qualify for a significant U.S. subsidy. Talk about doubling down—even the original 2020 goal was considered a long shot by Wall Street. This new target would pledge the carmaker to a faster production growth rate than Ford Motor Co. managed in the early 1900s. That\\'s when Henry Ford pioneered the production line with the Model T, the first mass-market combustion-driven car. A century later, Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk wants the Model 3 to be its electric grandchild. He\\'s now aiming for close to a million sales by 2020. \\xa0BNEF tracked 234,000 electric car sales worldwide last year, of which Tesla made up a fifth of the market, Morsy said. For Tesla to stay on its new track, it would need to produce more cars next year than the entire global electric-car industry made in 2015.\\xa0Tesla\\'s first mass-produced car, the $35,000 Model 3, will need to come to market on schedule, and with great momentum, in late 2017. Telsa\\'s battery factory in Nevada must flourish, costs must come down, and car-making capacity must scale up at an astonishing rate.\\xa0For context: Tesla has never managed to hit one of Musk\\'s timelines for a new product launch. Not once.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nFitbit shares tank after reporting a weak outlook amid rising competition:\\xa0Fitbit is not having a good day, with the stock crashing more than 11 percent after reporting its first-quarter results. Here’s the rub: its guidance for the second quarter came in light. Very light. Industry watchers were expecting the company to report earnings around 26 cents per share, while the company put its outlook at earnings between 8 cents per share and 11 cents per share. That’s a pretty big miss, and another indicator that the company will be facing some challenges in the wearable market. Here’s the quick rundown of the report: Devices: 4.8 million units sold. Earnings: 10 cents per share, against analyst estimates of 3 cents per share. Revenue: $505.4 million, against analyst estimates of $443 million. In the past six months, Fitbit shares are down more than 50 percent. Fitbit is facing a ton of increasing competition, not only from Apple with the Apple Watch, but from international manufacturers like Xiaomi and the usual competition from Jawbone. Fitbit’s usual strategy has been to go after the fitness-tracking market with a portfolio of devices, but recently it’s somewhat diverged from that with the launch of a smartwatch. Naturally, given Fitbit’s previous success, a shift in strategy may not be very welcome to investors looking for continued growth in the company — and a strong return.\\xa0All this has forced Fitbit to find more unique ways to prove to consumers that it is the best option when it comes to fitness tracking. One recent example was an integration with the Amazon Echo, in which users can ask with their voice how they are performing through their Fitbit devices. It’s novel use cases like these that might propel the company above the competition, but so far we haven’t seen any kind of dramatic success on that front.\\n\\n\\nFlipkart valuation marked down by two more investors:\\xa0Two small mutual fund investors at Flipkart have marked down the company’s valuation, joining other investors who believe that India’s largest e-commerce firm is overvalued. Valic Co 1 marked down Flipkart’s value by 29.4% as of February, compared with August 2015, according to a regulatory filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Valic valued Flipkart’s Series D stock at $98 a share in February, down from $139 a share in August.Fidelity Rutland Square Trust II marked down Flipkart’s value by as much as 39.6% as of February, compared with last August, according to a filing with the SEC. Fidelity valued Flipkart’s Series D stock at $82 a share in February, down from $135.8 a share in August. The Economic Times reported about the markdowns earlier on Wednesday. To be sure, Fidelity and Valic hold very small amounts of Flipkart stock. Their holdings together are worth less than $6 million. That’s a minuscule fraction of Flipkart’s overall value. The company last raised $700 million from investors in July last year at a valuation $15 billion. But taken along with other markdowns by Morgan Stanley and T Rowe Price, both of which together own hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Flipkart stock, it confirms the view that Flipkart’s own investors believe the company is overvalued by a significant amount. In late February, Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Trust, another mutual fund investor in Flipkart, slashed the value of its holdings by as much as 27%. Then, last month, T Rowe Price disclosed in a filing that it cut the value of its stake in Flipkart by 15%.\\n\\n\\nFree Code Camp survey reveals demographics of self-taught coders: If you’ve ever wondered who exactly is signing up for all these free learn-at-home coding classes and tutorial websites, Free Code Camp (which is one of them) has kindly surveyed 15,624 users with regard to various basic demographics and some more code-centric items. Some of the stats are expected (few women — around 1 in 5 surveyed) and a few are surprising — for instance, only 18 percent said they’d like to work for a startup. Thirty-eight percent don’t plan on specializing in UX, backend stuff or other specific disciplines, which they might want to revisit later. And they’re all over the world — mostly the U.S., with India a close second — but the long tail comprises 167 more countries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber enables global e-hailing through Alipay to fend against Lyft/Didi alliance:\\xa0Starting today, Uber riders from China won’t have to worry about language barriers or currency when traveling outside of the country.\\xa0Now, riders will be able to pay for and hail a ride in the Alipay app in the more than 400 cities in which Uber operates. It’s an extension of Uber’s existing partnership with the company, which initially only allowed passengers in China to pay for their rides using Alipay.\\xa0The move comes just a few weeks after Lyft and China’s Didi launched a similar integration that allows Didi riders to hail a Lyft in the U.S. using the Didi Chuxing (formerly Didi Kuaidi) app, and vice versa. That partnership is part of a larger global ride-hail alliance that also includes South East Asia’s Grab and India’s Ola.\\xa0The clear winner in this entire situation is Alipay’s affiliate company, Alibaba. That’s because the Chinese e-commerce company is playing both sides of the fence — Alibaba is an investor in both Didi and Lyft, and Ant Financial, which operates Alipay, has had this partnership with Uber since 2014.\\xa0It’s certainly true that Alibaba has a higher stake in Lyft and Didi beating out Uber, but the transportation industry isn’t a zero-sum game. Since there’s room for both sides to coexist, Alibaba can afford to put bets on Didi and Lyft, and Uber too.\\xa0But Alipay may be playing favorites. According to company SVP of business Emil Michael, Uber will be the primary featured transportation app on Alipay’s platform outside of the U.S. Alipay is essentially promoting Uber to its 450 million users.\\n\\n\\nInstagram is selling a new type of video ad:\\xa0Instagram has been pushing users to create more video content. Now it’s pushing advertisers to create more video ads.\\xa0Instagram announced Tuesday that it will soon roll out video carousel ads, a move that will let advertisers share up to five separate videos with one single ad purchase. Each video can be up to 60 seconds long.\\xa0Instagram already sells carousel ads, the kinds of ads that let users swipe between different pages (often called cards). But video functionality wasn’t available until now.\\xa0The change aligns with Instagram’s conscious push into video more broadly, a strategy reminiscent of Facebook’s video push a few years back. Instagram is adding video featuresand making video more prominent in search in hopes users will watch more of it. It’s essentially feeding people what it wants them to consume — and video can be good business.\\xa0If users expect to see videos when they open Instagram, then video ads, which are typically more lucrative than static ads, won’t feel out of place.\\xa0These new video ads are now in beta and will roll out to all advertisers in the “coming weeks,” according to a company spokesperson.\\n\\n\\nAmazon, Web Giants Shift to Report Real Cost of Equity Pay:\\xa0For more than a decade, technology companies doled out heaps of stock to recruit top talent -- then pretended this wasn’t a normal part of doing business by reporting profit numbers that subtracted the cost. That’s changing as the industry grows up and responds to pressure from regulators and investors. Amazon.com Inc. started breaking out stock-based compensation in the results of its different businesses in the first quarter. This is “the way we now evaluate our business performance and manage our operations,” Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told analysts after the earnings report last week. Facebook Inc. Chief Financial Officer David Wehner had a similar message. From now on, he said he’ll talk about the social network’s results and other metrics based on U.S. standards known as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, which include equity-based pay costs, instead of a mix of GAAP and non-GAAP numbers. “We view it as a real expense,” he said. Some technology companies, such as Netflix Inc. and Intel Corp., already take this approach, but many don’t. If the shift to focusing on the real bottom line catches on more broadly, it could slice billions of dollars off the reported profits and official forecasts that underpin the technology sector’s lofty market valuations. Facebook stock trades at about 35 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months. Add in equity compensation expense and that price-to-earnings ratio jumps to 50, according to a Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysis. Amazon would trade at 122 times projected profit, rather than a multiple of 63. Using GAAP numbers, Alphabet Inc. would trade at 26 times forecast profit, versus 21 times, Bernstein estimates. The change also highlights the struggles of smaller Internet companies like Twitter Inc. and LinkedIn Corp. to generate GAAP earnings. Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet may have high stock valuations, but they are also very profitable by GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Twitter shares trade at about 36 times estimated profit, but including stock-based compensation analysts expect it to have a loss over the next 12 months, Bernstein research shows. “Some companies have been egregious with stock compensation,” Fish said, citing LinkedIn, which has relatively high equity-based pay compared to its revenue and earnings.\\xa0LinkedIn shares have declined 44 percent this year, while rival social network Facebook is up 13 percent.\\n\\n\\nGoogle, Fiat Chrysler to partner on self-driving minivans:\\xa0Alphabet Inc\\'s Google unit and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV have agreed to work together to build a fleet of 100 self-driving minivans in the most advanced collaboration to date between Silicon Valley and a traditional carmaker, the companies said Tuesday.\\xa0The deal marks the first time that Google has worked directly with an automaker \"to integrate its self-driving system, including its sensors and software, into a passenger vehicle,\" the companies said in a statement on Tuesday.\\xa0Google and Fiat Chrysler engineers will work together to fit Google\\'s autonomous driving technology into the Pacifica minivan. Some engineers for both companies will work together at a facility in Southeast Michigan, where Fiat Chrysler has its major North American engineering center, the companies said. Google said it is not sharing proprietary self-driving vehicle technology with Fiat Chrysler, however, and the vehicles will not be offered for sale to the public.\\xa0The agreement between Google and Fiat Chrysler comes as rival technology and auto companies are accelerating efforts to master the complex hardware and artificial intelligence systems required to allow vehicles to pilot themselves.\\n\\n\\nMatch Group revenue beats as Tinder attracts more paid users:\\xa0Dating website operator Match Group Inc reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue on Tuesday, as its popular dating app Tinder attracted more paying users. The company\\'s shares rose 7.3 percent to $11.98 in after-hours trading. Match Group, which also owns Match.com and OkCupid, gets bulk of its revenue from membership fees and paid features. The company said its average paid-member count jumped 36 percent to 5.1 million in the first quarter ended March 31, also helped by the acquisition of PlentyOfFish. Match Group, majority owned by media mogul Barry Diller\\'s IAC/InterActiveCorp, agreed to buy Vancouver-based PlentyOfFish for $575 million in July last year. Tinder surpassed 1 million paid members during the quarter. The Dallas-based company\\'s dating business, its biggest, which includes apps such as Tinder, recorded a 24 percent rise in revenue to $260.4 million. Total revenue rose 21.4 percent to $285.3 million. Revenue from the company\\'s non-dating business, which includes educational websites Princeton Review and Tutor.com, was flat at $24.9 million.\\xa0Up to Tuesday\\'s close of $11.16, Match Group\\'s shares had fallen 7 percent since the company went public in November.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis new apartment is like a college dorm for grown-ups:\\xa0WeWork, a provider of co-working spaces in 28 cities, isn’t content to just offer you a place to do your job. This week it’s opening WeLive, which offers furnished living quarters and a range of extra amenities in a fresh take on what apartment life should be like.\\xa0The apartments themselves are on the small side, and many lack a complete kitchen or a full-sized fridge. In some apartments the beds fold into the wall to create more space. But when residents step outside their own walls they have access to common areas including large kitchens stocked with appliances, game rooms, quiet areas and a community garden. WeLive is designed around flexibility — residents live month to month rather than signing a one-year lease. There’s no need to wait for the cable guy to hook up one’s TV or Internet service. And no one has to shop for a bed, couch or table. Residents need to arrive with little more than their clothes. A security deposit is required, but credit checks aren’t done.\\xa0A private studio in Crystal City starts at $1,640 a month, and a studio with two beds starts at $1,880. There are also one-, two-, three- and four-bedroom apartments. A four-bedroom goes for $4,220 a month. Residents pay a $125 monthly fee that covers utilities, cable and Internet. The New York apartments are more expensive, with private units starting at $2,550. Stephanie Sutton, 31, moved into WeLive’s Crystal City location a month ago. WeLive has brought in some residents early as part of a test period. Sutton said her favorite aspect has been the sense of community.\\xa0“It really does feel like home,” she said. “It’s a great way to develop friendships without any pressure. Here you passively make 10 friends instantly.”\\n\\n\\nMid-Career and Itching to Lead a Startup? This VC Firm Wants You:\\xa0It’s easy to spot the silver hair among Jungle Ventures’ gallery of startup founders. Look closer and you’ll find many have called the shots at banks and Fortune 500 outfits.\\xa0\\xa0That’s no accident. Jungle Ventures’ strategy involves betting on executive-suite veterans over starry-eyed twentysomethings who dream of changing the world, saidAmit Anand, co-founder and managing partner of the Singapore-based firm.\\xa0\\xa0While peers crave youthful upstart vision, Jungle Ventures openly courts corporate bigwigs wondering where to take their careers. Singapore is an Asian base for global banking and technology firms such as Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp. -- and that’s its advantage, Anand said. Professionals more accustomed to navigating the corporate jungle than envisioning the next Facebook can become standout entrepreneurs with a little help, he said. And they know how to make a buck. Jungle’s unusual approach seems to have paid off: it’s cashed out of three startups in four years including ZipDial, bought last year by Twitter Inc. Its tactics have won investment from heavy-hitters like Singaporean state investor Temasek Holdings Pte, International Finance Corp. and the wealthy Thakral family. Anand said it’s close to raising a new $100 million fund to add consumer tech and Internet of Things to a portfolio spanning e-commerce, finance and software across Asia.Anand and co-founder Anurag Srivastava were professionals-turned-entrepreneurs themselves before they met through Sony Entertainment Television co-founder Jayesh Parekh and started Jungle in 2012. Over the next four years, the pair witnessed the Singaporean startup scene transform from young university dropouts into an arena dominated by mid-career professionals with serious banking and Internet chops.\\xa0\\xa0They were “leaving their jobs, knowing their industries inside out, wanting to disrupt their own industry. More seasoned, more experienced, going after very large ideas,” Anand said. “That’s something we are going to double down on over the next years, to back more professionals turning into entrepreneurs in disruptive industries, trying to create new industries.”\\n\\n\\nOculus will sell its virtual reality headset in Best Buy stores beginning this week:\\xa0Facebook-owned Oculus wants to take virtual reality mainstream, so it’s bringing its VR headset to the place mainstream shoppers can find it: Retail stores. Oculus announced Monday that it will begin selling “a small number” of Oculus Rift headsets in 48 Best Buy stores around the country later this week. It’s the first time the Rift has been available in-store, although Best Buy has already been selling the Rift online. Perhaps more important than actually selling the headset from a physical store is Oculus’ plan to set up demos for these devices at each Best Buy location. Virtual reality is still a very niche industry that appeals primarily to gamers. Simply getting the word out that Oculus exists and is available for purchase is still a challenge. Putting demo stations inside Best Buys could help educate shoppers who stumble upon the product for the first time.\\xa0Oculus started selling the Rift in January and shipping them in March, but the process hasn’t been as smooth as expected. Lots of the orders have been delayed, so Oculus says that those waiting on a preorder can buy a Rift in-store and still get the rest of their preorder perks (like a game and first dibs on the Oculus controllers, which are alsodelayed).\\xa0This backup was not-so-subtly hinted at in the company’s blog post Monday: “Quantities [in Best Buy] will be extremely limited while we catch up on Rift preorders.” So don’t hold your breath.\\xa0In addition to selling in Best Buy starting May 7, Oculus will also sell online from Microsoft and Amazon beginning this week.\\n\\n\\nBrazil orders cell phone carriers to block WhatsApp for 72 hours:\\xa0WhatsApp, Facebook’s messaging service that recently rolled out end-to-end encryption to its users, will be blocked in Brazil for 72 hours, starting this afternoon. A judge from the small Brazilian state of Sergipe ordered telecom providers in the country to block WhatsApp today in a dispute over access to encrypted data. Judge Marcel Montalvao has ordered WhatsApp to turn over chat records related to a drug investigation, but WhatsApp has argued that it cannot access the chats in an unencrypted form and therefore cannot provide the required records to the court. Local newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported that the ban would begin at 2 p.m. local time and that phone companies in the country would face fines if they did not comply. This isn’t Montalvao’s first clash with WhatsApp, which boasts more than 100 million Brazilian users. The judge ordered the arrest of Facebook’s vice president for Latin America, Diego Dzodan, in March. Facebook has said that WhatsApp operates with relative independence and that Dzodan has no control over WhatsApp data. Brazil also cut off access to WhatsApp in the country last December. Although the block was ordered to last for 48 hours, it was lifted after just 12 hours.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow Foursquare knew before almost anyone how bad things were for Chipotle:\\xa0Chipotle announced its first loss as a public company Tuesday. But two weeks earlier, an unlikely source —the social media app Foursquare — had beat Chipotle to the punch,predicting in a blog post that the burrito maker’s sales would drop nearly 30 percent. Chipotle made it official Tuesday afternoon — reporting a drop of 29.7 percent. \\xa0The remarkably accurate prediction from a company consumers know for restaurant tips and the ability to check in at locations highlights the emerging power of the gobs of data our smartphones collect and the opportunity for savvy companies to convert that information into piles of cash. Foursquare has spent seven years collecting data and has 85 million places in its database. It describes its data trove as the “biggest foot traffic panel in the world.” Clients that buy Foursquare’s data to glean insights include retailers, real estate developers, Wall Street traders and consumer package-goods companies.\\xa0Foursquare, the seven-year-old start-up, cleverly turned smartphone data into predictions on Chipotle sales that matched Wall Street analysts with far more experience in projecting the successes of businesses such as Chipotle. Last year, Foursquare used its foot-traffic data to predict how many iPhones Apple would sell on a given weekend. Foursquarepredicted sales of 13 million to 15 million. Apple then announced sales of more than 13 million.Once a handful of Foursquare users have checked in at a location, the company knows that a given location represents a certain store. If the smartphones of another Foursquare user move inside these premises — but doesn’t check in — Foursquare still knows the user was in the store. Foursquare relies on GPS data, WiFi, cell towers and beacons to pinpoint where smartphone users are.\\xa0Data experts caution that there are limits to how far Foursquare can replicate its Chipotle predictions elsewhere. They say Foursquare’s success will work best at large chains. Foursquare needs a lot of data to make such predictions, so it would probably struggle to accurately predict the sales of a retailer that has only a handful of locations.Another limitation to Foursquare’s approach is the nature of a store. Chipotle lends itself to a foot-traffic analysis because customers overwhelmingly travel in person to a store to get their food. It would be more difficult to predict the sales at a business that sells a significant amount of goods online.\\n\\n\\nGas Delivery Startups Want to Fill Up Your Car Anywhere. Is That Allowed?:\\xa0A new crop of startups are trying to make gas stations obsolete. Tap an app, and they\\'ll bring the gas to you, filling up your car while you\\'re at work, eating breakfast, or watching Netflix. Filld, WeFuel, Yoshi, Purple and Booster Fuels have started operating in a few cities including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Palo Alto, Nashville, Tennessee, and Atlanta, Georgia. But officials in some of those cities say that driving around in a pickup truck with hundreds of gallons of gasoline might not be safe.\\xa0“It is not permitted,” said Lt. Jonathan Baxter, a spokesman for the San Francisco fire department. Baxter said if San Francisco residents see any companies fueling vehicles in the city, they should call the fire department.\\xa0Yoshi, which operates in San Francisco, was surprised to hear Baxter\\'s concerns. “We haven\\'t talked to them. I don\\'t know about that. It’s news to me,” said co-founder Nick Alexander. The next day, he said he believed Yoshi was following the law and that it had been careful to limit the size of their gas tanks to stay under limits outlined in the International Fire Code, a guideline followed by many U.S. states.\\xa0Filld, an 18-month-old startup with thousands of customers in Silicon Valley, plans to start service in San Francisco on Monday, deploying three delivery trucks at 1 p.m. “You can never ask for permission because no one will give it,” said Chris Aubuchon, the chief executive officer at Filld.\\xa0The Los Angeles Fire Department said it’s drafting a policy around gasoline delivery. “Our current fire code does not allow this process; however, we are exploring a wayhis could be allowed with some restrictions,” said Capt. Daniel Curry, a spokesman for the city’s fire department. “It’s just one of these things that nobody has really thought about before—kind of like how Uber popped up out of nowhere.” But he said it’s not a gray area: “All I can tell you at this time is it’s not allowed as per our current fire code.”\\n\\n\\nWhy is Facebook doing so well?\\xa0Facebook reported yet another quarter of strong user growth, in marked contrast to Twitter, which has been eking out only very modest growth recently. In fact, over the past year Facebook’s monthly active users grew by roughly two-thirds the size of Twitter’s entire base. This wasn’t a one-off — Facebook has grown by over 150 million users year on year for the past four years at least, and growth has actually accelerated recently: Predictably, the strongest growth has been in the least mature markets — Asia and Facebook’s “Rest of World” geographic segments led the charge, with more than 75 million new users each over the past year, while North America and Europe added fewer users (but still grew decently). That reemphasizes the importance of Facebook’s efforts to grow usage in those emerging markets and, hence, projects like Free Basics (recently shut down in India) and its other connectivity projects. So far, though, it seems to be doing just fine in these countries. \\xa0Average revenue per user is also growing strongly across the board, led by the U.S. and Canada, where annual ARPU is approaching $50. Other regions have far lower ARPU — the rest of the world combined has an annual ARPU of just $7. That overall ARPU growth multiplied by the user growth is driving phenomenal overall revenue growth. And, because that growth requires a much more modest increase in costs, it’s also driving margin expansion. Revenue grew by 52 percent year on year for the second quarter in a row, and operating margin was up 11 points year on year. Just as a reminder, that revenue is almost all coming from ads at this point — the FarmVille era is well and truly over at this point, and payments are a tiny fraction of total revenue for Facebook today. One of the hardest things to get at in Facebook’s results is the role of Instagram. The app has been serving up ads for some time now, and management has been talking up the benefits in general terms for several quarters. But it doesn’t break out metrics other than monthly active users (400 million at last count). In addition, Instagram users are excluded from the MAU count Facebook reports and on which it bases its ARPU calculations, even though Instagram revenue is included in ARPU. As such, there’s a little misdirection going on, in that Facebook is including Instagram in the numerator but not the denominator here.\\xa0There is, to be sure, a good chance that many Instagram users are also Facebook users, so there’s not too much double counting, but I do wonder how much of the growth in ARPU is from Facebook monetizing Instagram better. From a perspective of internal threats to success, Facebook is placing some biggish bets on future projects like virtual reality (through Oculus) and research and development into new forms of connectivity, both projects outside its core business, and therefore both potential distractions and financial sinkholes. But the scope of these efforts seems to be modest in the context of Facebook’s overall business, and its margins aren’t suffering yet. Government action on Free Basics, as we’ve already seen in India, is another possible threat, but a modest one at this point, and one few other governments seem willing to take on for now. \\xa0Perhaps the biggest threat of all is that platform owners like Apple and Google end up owning the next round of devices and platforms in the same way they have smartphones, despite Facebook’s VR investments, and steadily squeeze out third parties they perceive as a threat. Facebook seems aware of this possibility, and has invested not just in VR as a potential future interface but also an increasingly OS-like presence on smartphones.\\n\\n\\nAccording to its cofounder and CEO Snapchat is mainly “a camera company”:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Despite all of its new bells and whistles… and the billions of videos, ads, and effects that have been added to the service, Snapchat chief executive Evan Spiegel still thinks of the new media juggernaut he’s created as “a camera company”.\\xa0While Snapchat Stories may be the feature that brings the company the revenue model it needs to validate its $16 billion valuation, and while the ephemeral messaging feature may be what initially attracted the hordes of millennials sending digital ephemera to each other billions of times a day, Spiegel says that the camera itself remains Snapchat’s unifying feature.\\xa0Snapchat opens to the camera, Spiegel said. Chat is available to the left of the camera, and Stories is available to the right of the camera. That not only differentiates it from other social media products, but allows Snapchat to straddle the line between the defining features of several of them.\\xa0“The beautiful thing is it sort of sits in the middle, but more importantly it opens to the camera,” Spiegel said. “The thing that feeds a social network is content… Similarly with communication… So in our view, when you take a snap and you choose this path between talking to your friends or adding it to your Story we end up with this harmony where both of these businesses feed themselves. I don’t think it’s one or the other.”\\xa0In a way, even the company’s movement into filters, stickers, and lenses such as face swap are further extensions of the original thesis of Snapchat as a photographic communication tool. “Now you can put the way you feel… in the moment you’re experiencing. For us that’s just the beginning of some fun, creative tools,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon’s Cloud Business Lifts Its Profit to a Record:\\xa0\\xa0Amazon delivered a blowout quarter on Thursday, joining Facebook as one of the rare bright spots in a technology sector that has recently produced a string of disappointing earnings reports.\\xa0Helped by its fast-growing Amazon Web Services business, the company jumped to the most profitable quarter in its nearly 22-year history.For the first quarter, which ended March 31, Amazon reported net income of $513 million, or $1.07 a share, up from a loss of $57 million, or 12 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.\\xa0Revenue at the company rose to $29.13 billion from $22.72 billion a year ago.\\xa0Amazon’s share price jumped more than 12 percent in after-hours trading after the results were released. Investors were happy to see the company show profits after the disappointing run of reports from Apple, Google,Microsoft and Intel. The biggest source of the company’s profits is Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing business that started just over a decade ago and is now on track to bring in more than $10 billion a year in revenue. A.W.S., as the business is known, is the most popular cloud service for start-ups and for a growing number of big companies that want to rent computing capacity, rather than run their own hardware and software.\\xa0Cloud computing is also much more profitable than Amazon’s North American retail business, which runs on thinner margins, and its international retail business, which runs at a loss. The operating income for A.W.S. more than tripled in the quarter to $604 million.\\xa0The profits from A.W.S. represented 56 percent of Amazon’s total operating income, even though the $2.57 billion in revenue from A.W.S. — up 64 percent from a year earlier — amounted to less than 9 percent of total revenue.\\n\\n\\n\\nBaidu First-Quarter Profit, Revenue Outlook Beat Estimates:\\xa0Baidu Inc. posted earnings in the first quarter that beat analysts’ estimates and forecast revenue in the current quarter that also tops projections after China’s biggest search engine provider controlled its spending and increased sales from new businesses.\\xa0Earnings excluding some costs were $1.06 per American depository share in the first quarter, the Beijing-based company said Thursday. That compares with the average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg of $1.01. Sales for the quarter increased 24 percent to $2.45 billion compared with estimates for $2.44 billion. For the second quarter, Baidu said it expects revenue of $3.12 billion to $3.19 billion, compared with estimates of $3.10 billion.Baidu’s depository receipts rose 5.5 percent to $195.80 in extended U.S. trading.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLinkedIn Rises on Better-Than-Expected Earnings Forecast:\\xa0LinkedIn Corp. forecast earnings that beat estimates on improved performance from its main recruiting tools, suggesting a surprise slowdown earlier this year was not as dire as analysts feared.\\xa0The operator of the largest online professional network said second-quarter profit, excluding some items, will be from 74 cents to 77 cents a share. That beat the 71-cent average analyst estimate.\\xa0First-quarter earnings topped expectations by a wide margin and the company raised its full-year revenue guidance to $3.65 billion to $3.70 billion, from an earlier range of $3.6 billion to $3.65 billion. \\xa0LinkedIn Corp. forecast earnings that beat estimates on improved performance from its main recruiting tools, suggesting a surprise slowdown earlier this year was not as dire as analysts feared.\\xa0The operator of the largest\\xa0online professional network said second-quarter profit, excluding some items, will be from 74 cents to 77 cents a share.

He said he made roughly $2 billion on Apple, a stock he continued to tout as \"cheap\" despite his reservations.Icahn said China\\'s attitude toward Apple largely drove him to exit his position.\\xa0\"You worry a little bit — and maybe more than a little — about China\\'s attitude,\" Icahn said, later adding that China\\'s government could \"come in and make it very difficult for Apple to sell there ... you can do pretty much what you want there.\"\\xa0He added, though, that if China \"was basically steadied,\" he would buy back into Apple.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Apple Watch did not change the Apple Store like we thought it would:\\xa0It was just over a year ago that the Apple Watch was slated to be unveiled, and the Internet rumor and analysis machine was running in overdrive: Wall Street-types weighed in on whether the new gadget could propel the world’s most valuable company to greater revenue and an even higher stock price. Tech geeks were chattering about the nitty-gritty of its features, and culture mavens debated whether it would become a game changer like the iPod or iPhone before it.\\xa0And in the retail world, the major question was this: Would the arrival of a product that was not just a gadget, but also a luxury fashion item, push Apple to shake up its successful store format?\\xa0The root of the speculation, or at least, the primary fuel for it, was a single paragraph in a New Yorker profile of Apple’s design chief, Jonathan Ive. In that story it was reported that Ive and Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of retail, were working on a redesign of Apple stores, perhaps to make the setting more conducive to selling a luxury timepiece. The story noted that Ive had “overheard someone saying, ‘I’m not going to buy a watch if I can’t stand on carpet.’\\u2008”\\xa0And so analysts — and reporters, including this one — began wondering: Would certain sections of the store be carpeted? Would they be outfitted with full-length mirrors so people could see how the watch fit into their overall look? Would there be showcase lighting, like at an upscale jeweler?\\xa0If you’ve set foot in an Apple store lately, you know the answer to all of these questions: No.\\xa0Apple did end up adding a backroom VIP area to at least one store in New York where customers could try on the Edition, the luxe version of the watch that has a five-figure price tag.\\xa0But the Apple Store, by and large, still has the same vibe and aesthetic that it did in the pre-Watch era. Sure, some newer stores have fresh features, such as one in Brussels that is outfitted with live trees. An Apple representative has said that a forthcoming store in Memphis is to be a “next-generation” Apple store, with new design elements such as a large TV screen that can display a changing array of products or artwork. But even with those kinds of potential changes, the Apple Store continues to be defined by a spare, contemporary look and feel — and the changes that have been implemented or are on the way don’t exactly seem linked to the unique needs of selling the watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook revenue smashes expectations as mobile ad sales surge:\\xa0Facebook Inc\\'s (FB.O) quarterly revenue rose more than 50 percent, handily beating Wall Street expectations as its wildly popular mobile app and a push into live video lured new advertisers and encouraged existing ones to boost spending.\\xa0The company\\'s shares rose 9.5 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday to $118.39, setting it on track to open at a new high on Thursday, at nearly triple its initial public offering four years ago.\\xa0Facebook also announced it will create a new class of non-voting shares in a move aimed at letting Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg give away his wealth without relinquishing control of the social media juggernaut he founded. Some 1.65 billion people used Facebook monthly as of March 31, up from 1.44 billion a year earlier. Zuckerberg said users were spending more than 50 minutes per day on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, a huge amount of time given the millions of apps available to users. \"The company consistently \\'warns\\' about higher spending, but they consistently manage their spending to deliver earnings upside. They\\'re an impressive company, and they leave very little room for criticism,\" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter, who called the operating margin a good surprise.\\xa0Facebook did not offer details on sales of its Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, but emphasized that it was early days and said that sales would not significantly impact 2016 revenue. \\xa0The company\\'s net income attributable to common shareholders nearly tripled to $1.51 billion, or 52 cents per share, in the first quarter from $509 million, or 18 cents per share, a year earlier.\\xa0Excluding items, the company earned 77 cents per share, beating Wall Street\\'s 62-cent consensus.\\xa0Total revenue rose to $5.38 billion from $3.54 billion, with ad revenue increasing 56.8 percent to $5.20 billion. Mobile ad revenue accounted for about 82 percent of total ad revenue, compared with about 73 percent a year earlier.\\n\\n\\nPayPal beats the street on Q1 sales of $2.54B and EPS of $0.37:\\xa0Payments giant PayPal posted strong Q1 earnings today, counter balancing some of the weaker showings from other tech stocks yesterday and outstripping the overall growth rate of e-commerce, in its own words. Following in the footsteps of its former parent, which alsoposted strong results for Q1, PayPal posted revenues of $2.544 billion with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.37, rising 19% and 28% respectively on a year ago and both beating analysts’ projections of $2.5 billion and $0.35 EPS. The company says it has 184 million customers now, up by 4.5 million, with 1.4 billion transactions in the quarter up 26% on a year ago. Services like Venmo and the company’s expansion into credit and other services has given the company a life on average transactions per customer, which were up 12% to 28 payments per user, and $81 billion in total payment volume.\\xa0That $81 billion in TPV, it said, “was faster than the growth rate of e-commerce.”\\xa0On the merchant side, there are now 14 million active accounts.\\xa0When it comes to new-wave revenues, PayPal is showing some of its legacy: the company only completes 26% of transactions on mobile devices today, versus 22% a year ago.\\n\\n\\nA Silicon Valley VC says investors from China are joining Series A deals, and they’re playing “hardball”:\\xa0On valuations:\\xa0The average thing coming out of Y Combinator is probably a half to three-quarters of what it was [in terms of valuation in recent years]. The average seed-stage deal is half.\\xa0On hardball tactics:\\xa0Docs are taking longer because there are new investors coming in, and they want more stuff in their terms. These are newer investors, often foreign investors, who are basically saying: “I want senior preference to [a company’s earlier] investors,” and that’s adding two or three weeks as they usually ask right as the docs are closing. They’re almost all from China, and they want all of their preferences to be senior to everyone else’s. What’s happening is, since they know the capital’s financials, they just wait it out. By that point, we’ve already signed a term sheet and turned off a lot of other people who wanted to invest. These things never come up in the term sheet phase but later in the docs. They’ll say, “We did our diligence, and we need XYZ to invest.” It’s not a great way to start a relationship. People in the ecosystem around here are playing for the long term; they realize that sooner or later, they’ll be on the other side of the table and don’t want this stuff applied to them. This is mostly coming from Asia, where they play much harder hardball than here. And [these investors] do it with a happy face. That’s just the environment [to which they’re accustomed].\\xa0On the slowdown in tech valuations:\\xa0\\xa0I don’t expect it to pick up any time soon, which is a function of retail and institutional investors looking for high-growth stories with profit associated with them. They want profit and growth. Meanwhile, a lot of companies that have strong revenue can’t show that growth, and vice versa. There just aren’t a lot of companies that could sustain being public right now.\\n\\n\\nAmazon is liable for billing you for your kid’s wild in-app purchases, a judge says:\\xa0\\xa0A federal judge ruled on Tuesday that Amazon is liable for billing parents for unauthorized in-app purchases made by their children. With the ruling, U.S. District Court Judge John Coughenour sided with the Federal Trade Commission in its lawsuit against Amazon for failing to get consent from parents for in-app purchases made by kids. “Many of Amazon’s arguments improperly assume a familiarity with in-app purchases on the part of consumers,” the judge said in the ruling. “For example, Amazon cites to a case determining that a ‘reasonable Amazon customer is accustomed to online shopping,’ but online shopping and spending real currency while obtaining virtual items in a game are completely different user activities.” The court has not yet ruled on how much Amazon will have to pay out to customers affected by the practice. The FTC previously settled with Apple and Google in similar cases, resulting in more than $50 million being returned to consumers.\\n\\n\\nChinese phone makers Oppo and Vivo pass Xiaomi in global phone sales:\\xa0Being the “it” smartphone sure doesn’t last long.\\xa0New data from IDC finds that Xiaomi now trails several of its less well known Chinese rivals when it comes to global market share. Overall, there were 334.9 million smartphones worldwide in the first quarter of 2016, IDC said, up very slightly from the 334.3 million units a year ago. That marks the smallest year-over-year growth on record.\\xa0Oppo and Vivo, two names unfamiliar to most Americans, are now the No. 4 and No. 5 phone sellers behind Samsung, Apple and Huawei, another big Chinese hardware maker. Huawei is also on the rise, still far short of its goal of supplanting Apple and Samsung, but at least closing the gap on the two leaders.\\xa0Oppo and Vivo are mostly known in the Chinese market, though Oppo now gets about 20 percent of its sales from outside its home turf.\\n\\n\\nIt feels like every tech company is offering cash advances. Shopify is the latest:\\xa0Following in the footsteps of PayPal and Square, e-commerce software company Shopify said on Wednesday that it would start offering cash advances to business owners who use its software. The program, called Shopify Capital, will let eligible Shopify merchants obtain a lump-sum cash advance in exchange for a fixed percentage of their daily sales. Cash advances are popular with small businesses that don’t have the time or business history to secure a loan from a bank. The Shopify announcement comes more than two years after payments companies PayPal and Square began offering similar programs. Right now, companies that serve small businesses are seeing this market as a way to create a new revenue stream that can be sold to existing customers — and, they hope, help retain them. They are joining an increasingly crowded space, as the online alternative lending space has heated up in recent years. Merchant cash advances have had a mixed reputation in the past, due to hidden fees and the risk of a business getting addicted to them. But internet companies like Shopify are trying to remove the stigma around them by promising to disclose up front how a business will pay back the advance. Square recently moved from offering cash advances to actual loans.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",
      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple\\'s nine-year iPhone juggernaut stops with first sales decline since 2003:\\xa0Apple on Tuesday posted its first-ever decline in iPhone sales and its first revenue drop in 13 years as the company credited with inventing the smartphone struggles with an increasingly saturated market. The company\\'s sales dropped by more than a quarter in China, its most important market after the United States, and it also forecast another disappointing quarter for global revenues. Its shares fell about 8 percent, dropping below $100 for the first time since February. A hike in Apple\\'s share buyback and dividend as well as bumper revenue from services failed to mollify investors. While Apple executives had predicted iPhone sales would decline this quarter, they must reassure investors that the drop represents a momentary roadblock, rather than a permanent shift for the product that fueled its meteoric rise. After years of blockbuster sales, many investors fear the iPhone has reached saturation, spelling the end for Apple\\'s exponential growth. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters that the success of the iPhone 6 a year earlier had set a difficult bar to beat in the second quarter. \"The iPhone 6 is an anomaly,\" he said. He pointed to the services division, which includes Apple Music and the App Store, as a bright spot. Its revenue grew 20 percent to $6 billion and surpassed iMac and iPad sales. Apple forecast third-quarter revenue of $41 billion to $43 billion, short of the Wall Street consensus of $47.3 billion. The drop in after-hours shares wipes out roughly $46 billion in market capitalization, roughly the value of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar. In reaction to Apple\\'s results, shares of its suppliers Skyworks Solutions, Qorvo, Broadcom \\xa0and NXP Semiconductors all fell 2 percent or more on Tuesday.\\n\\n\\nTwitter stock plunges as earnings miss estimates:\\xa0Twitter disappointed investors yet again with first-quarter results that showed stagnant revenue growth as the microblogging service struggles to grab new users amid efforts to improve its complicated interface with several new features. Twitter shares plunged 13.6 percent to $15.34 in late trade on Tuesday after reporting lower-than-expected revenue, hurt by weaker than expected spending by big advertisers, and providing a current-quarter revenue forecast well below analysts\\' expectations. Twitter\\'s user base grew modestly to 310 million monthly active users in the quarter ended March 31 from 305 million in the fourth quarter, above analysts\\' expectations. But investors were let down by the revenue miss since outlining a turnaround plan. First-quarter revenue rose 36 percent from a year earlier to $594.5 million, but widely missed the average analyst estimate of $607.8 million.\\xa0Its net loss narrowed to $79.7.million, or 12 cents per share, from $162.4 million, or 25 cents per share, a year earlier. \"It\\'s obvious Twitter is having trouble,\" said Arvind Bhatia, analyst with CRT Capital. \"It\\'s not growing anywhere close to where people expected a while back.\"\\n\\n\\nAlibaba Financial Affiliate Raises $4.5 Billion:\\xa0The Alibaba Group of China has become a colossus in the global Internet world, with a market value of nearly $200 billion.\\xa0Now its online payment affiliate is aiming for \\xa0similarly lofty financial goal: becoming one of the most valuable privately held technology companies in the world.\\xa0The affiliate, known as the Ant Financial Services Group, said on Tuesday that it had raised $4.5 billion from investors. The private financing round suggests that the company is now valued at about $60 billion — or more than $10 billion over the market value of PayPal Holdings, its closest analogue.\\xa0Ant Financial may not be as well known in the West as Silicon Valley darlings like Uber Technologies, which was most recently valued at about $62.5 billion. But Ant Financial — whose controlling shareholder isAlibaba’s billionaire founder, Jack Ma — has become an online power in its own right. It is one of the biggest electronic payment companies in the world by virtue of Alipay, a payment service that is commonly used in China.\\xa0It is also one of the most prominent symbols of strength in China’s private sector, particularly in the field of online payments. Slow-moving state-run banks and an initial absence of regulation have allowed privately run companies to weave themselves into everyday life.\\xa0Ant Financial now encompasses not only online payments, but also low-risk money market funds and a wallet app that enables easy payment from smartphones around China.\\xa0Chinese consumers use Alipay to shop online, transfer money to one another, hail taxis, buy movie tickets and even invest their spare change. A money-market fund affiliated with Ant Financial was once one of the world’s largest. According to the announcement on Tuesday, Alipay has more than 450 million users, or more than double the number PayPal has.\\xa0Such is the power of the company that its latest financing was led by some of China’s biggest state-controlled banks, including arms of the China Construction Bank and China Life Insurance. That indicates the level of government support that the company enjoys in a country where much of the economy is still state-directed.\\xa0Ant Financial’s previous fund-raising round, which was held last year, included China’s national social security fund and an arm of the China Development Bank.\\xa0In a move that could further endear the company to Chinese officials, Mr. Ma has said he hopes to take Ant Financial public in China.\\xa0Still, if Ant Financial follows through on the plan, it would be one of the biggest initial public offerings since that of Alibaba itself, which raisednearly $22 billion in 2014 in the biggest public offering on record.\\n\\n\\nEBay Forecast Beats Estimates as Traffic Efforts Pay Off:\\xa0EBay projected sales on its marketplace for the second quarter and full year that will meet or exceed analysts’ estimates, suggesting efforts to boost traffic, such as using barcode scanning and a more searchable catalog, are gaining traction.\\xa0Since separating from PayPal last year, Chief Executive Officer Devin Wenig has been under pressure to reverse sluggish growth at EBay in the face of competition from Amazon.com Inc., which continues to woo shoppers with fast delivery, and after Google changed its search algorithm in a way that hurt EBay traffic. The shares rose 2.1 percent to $24.98 in extended trading after the results were announced. They ended the day at $24.49, up 1.1 percent, and are down 11 percent so far this year.\\xa0Revenue in the second quarter will be $2.14 billion to $2.19 billion EBay said in a statement Tuesday. The average analyst estimate was for $2.14 billion.

Chip profits - which accounted for just under half of its overall 2015 operating income - are widely expected to fall, with some analysts predicting a drop of more than 10 percent in January-March from a year earlier.\\xa0But if its rivals are getting pummeled, the South Korean tech giant is merely bruised and is in many ways benefiting as clients shift towards premium power-conserving DRAM chips for smartphones, as well as solid-state drives for data storage using 3D NAND chips.\\xa0\"The technological gap between Samsung and its competitors in fields such as DRAM and NAND has been widening lately, which helps the company avoid the rate of profit decline seen at other firms,\" said Song Myung-sub, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities.\\xa0Even with a first-quarter drop of around 10 percent, Samsung\\'s chip operating profit is expected to be nearly five times that of SK Hynix.\\xa0The world\\'s No. 2 chipmaker also happens to run the world\\'s biggest smartphone business, giving it a captive customer for its chips that none of its rivals have.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe future of TV is arriving faster than anyone predicted: Late last week, Comcast announced a new program that allows makers of smart TVs and other Internet-based video services to have full access to your cable programming without the need for a set-top box. \\xa0Instead, the content will flow directly to the third-party device as an app, including all the channels and program guide.\\xa0The Xfinity TV Partner Program will initially be offered on new smart TVs from Samsung, as well as Roku streaming boxes. \\xa0But the program, built on open Internet-based standards including HTML5, is now open to other device manufacturers to adopt.\\xa0As video services move from hardware to software, the future of the traditional set-top box looks increasingly grim. With this announcement, Comcast customers may soon eliminate the need for an extra device, potentially saving hundreds of dollars in fees. Many in the industry have long predicted eventual death for the box, driven in part by a rapid migration by pay TV providers (including fiber and satellite-based companies) to Internet standards for both video content and services, and by the enthusiastic response of consumers to a growing number of Internet-based alternatives. These include Roku, as well as Amazon, Apple, Google, Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, SlingTV, Sony, HBO and many others.\\xa0Consumers, especially younger ones, are interested in defining their own video experience, mixing traditional and self-produced content and enjoying it not just on televisions but on every connected device, including tablets, smartphones and other mobile gadgets.\\xa0At this year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, it was clear that list would soon grow to include other non-traditional viewing platforms, such as cars, refrigerators and game consoles.\\xa0Comcast’s announcement suggests that future may already be here.\\n\\n\\nFacebook developing camera app similar to Snapchat: WSJ:\\xa0Facebook is developing a stand-alone camera app, similar to disappearing photo app Snapchat, to increase user engagement, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.The app, being developed by Facebook\\'s \"friend-sharing\" team in London, is in its early stages and may never come to fruition, according to the report. The company is also planning a feature that allows a user to record video through the app to begin live streaming, the newspaper reported.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Gannett-Tribune offer: No one knows what a newspaper is worth anymore:\\xa0\\xa0Three years ago, Jeff Bezos paid $250 million for the Washington Post from the Graham family. Last year, Japanese publisher Nikkei paid $1.3 billion to take the Financial Times off the hands of the education conglomerate Pearson.\\xa0Today’s $815 million bid to buy Tribune Publishing, from USA Today owner and newspaper chain Gannett, basically falls in the middle of those two recent deals. And it suggests that as print revenue continues to decline, there’s no such thing as a market price for newspapers anymore.\\xa0Gannett is offering $12.25 a share (5.6 times Ebitda*), or a 63 percent premium on the current value of its stock, to buy the struggling newspaper publisher, which owns eleven dailies, including the Chicago Tribune and crown jewel Los Angeles Times. In 2013, Bezos paid what analyst Ken Doctor called a “friendship premium” of 17 times Ebitda; when Nikkei bought the FT, the going rate for European newspapers was 12 times Ebitda. Nikkei paid 35 times Ebitda. This isn’t a friendly offer, meaning Tribune might not play ball, but investors sure seem to dig it. Tribune Publishing’s stock opened the day by rocketing up more than 50 percent. Wall Street probably likes it because of Tribune’s dwindling print business, which justifies the lower Ebitda on the Gannett offer.\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle Glass-based startup raises $17 million in funding:\\xa0Augmedix Inc, a startup that uses Alphabet Inc\\'s Google Glass to provide documentation services to doctors and other healthcare workers, said on Monday it had closed a $17 million funding round led by investment firm Redmile Group.\\xa0Augmedix\\'s employees transcribe doctors\\' notes and update patients\\' electronic medical record through Google Glass.\\xa0The San Francisco company, which has raised $40 million so far, also said it had received investments from five U.S. healthcare networks, including Sutter Health and Dignity Health, which together have more than 100,000 healthcare workers.\\xa0Augmedix, with 400 employees, said it serves doctors in nearly all 50 U.S. states.\\xa0Funds raised will be used to build up the service to serve more health systems and private clinics, the company said.\\xa0Augmedix is one of 10 partners authorized by Alphabet to deliver enterprise services through Google Glass.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA Marriage Gone Bad: Walgreens Struggles to Shake Off Theranos:\\xa0The sprawling drugstore chain, now a part of Walgreens Boots Alliance, was Theranos’s first — and thus far only — direct-to-consumer retail partner, promising to eventually make Theranos’s “wellness centers” an integral part of its more than 8,000 stores nationwide.\\xa0When it announced the deal in 2013, Walgreens hoped to drive traffic to its stores and bask in the reflected glow from one of Silicon Valley’s hottest unicorns and its youthful founder and glamorous chief executive, Elizabeth Holmes.\\xa0For unproved Theranos, the Walgreens endorsement was akin to the Good Housekeeping seal of approval. Theranos’s valuation vaulted to $9 billion and put Ms. Holmes on the Forbes list of billionaires.\\xa0Nearly three years later, with Theranos under siege on multiple regulatory fronts and its reputation in tatters, it’s clear that the relationship has been a disaster for Walgreens. The company has been trying to distance itself, halting expansion of Theranos testing in its stores and, in January, threatening to end the partnership if Theranos did not meet regulatory standards within 30 days.\\xa0But that deadline has come and gone. With this week’s news that Theranos is under criminal investigation for, among other things, possibly defrauding Walgreens and other investors, the question is: What will it take for Walgreens to end its troubled relationship? Theranos’s lawyers have taken a hard line, insisting that Walgreens is contractually bound by their agreement. So far, the approach has worked. Walgreens appears to have taken a cautious approach toward terminating the relationship, perhaps preferring to wait until federal regulators impose penalties or the criminal investigation yields formal charges, either of which would strengthen Walgreens’s hand.\\xa0But that could take years. Theranos can appeal any penalties, and a grand jury investigation could be a protracted process. And Theranos is likely to sue Walgreens in any event if it terminates their agreement.\\xa0In the meantime, Walgreens risks being dragged into nearly every negative story about Theranos.\\n\\n\\nInside One of the World’s Most Secretive iPhone Factories:\\xa0A few minutes past 9 a.m. at Pegatron Corp.’s vast factory on Shanghai’s outskirts, thousands of workers dressed in pink jackets are getting ready to make iPhones.\\xa0The men and women stare into face scanners and swipe badges at security turnstiles to clock in. The strict ID checks are there to make sure they don’t work excessive overtime. The process takes less than two seconds.\\xa0This is the realm in which the world’s most profitable smartphones are made, part of Apple Inc.’s closely guarded supply chain. After years of accusations that employees in China were forced to work long, grueling hours, Pegatron and Apple adopted new procedures to keep iPhone assemblers from amassing excessive overtime. They’re eager to show how the system works, and for the first time are granting a western journalist access into the inner sanctum.The factory at the corner of Xiu Yan and Shen Jiang roads is one of the most secretive facilities at the heart of iPhone production and covers an area equal to almost 90 football fields. In the center is a plaza with a firehouse, police station and post office. There are shuttle buses, mega-cafeterias, landscaped lawns and koi ponds. The grey and brown-hued concrete buildings are meant to evoke traditional Chinese architecture. The brand-new Shanghai Disneyland, which opens its doors in June, is a 20-minute drive away.Inside, the factory still hides a secret, according to China Labor Watch. Base pay remains so low that workers need overtime simply to make ends meet, the advocacy group said. It said 1,261 pay stubs from Pegatron’s Shanghai facility from September and October 2015 show evidence of excessive overtime. Pegatron, an Asustek spinoff, is the world’s biggest contract electronics manufacturer after Foxconn, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.Pegatron countered by saying the group miscounted because that period straddled state holidays, when pay was three times’ normal. Apple and Pegatron say they were never contacted by China Labor Watch, which said it approached Apple but didn’t get a response. Since March, the group said it’s collected an additional 441 pay stubs that point to continued excessive overtime.\\xa0Back in the cafeteria, a group of women rush to finish lunch before their 50-minute break is over. They hail from across China, from Sichuan in the west to Shandong in the northeast. None has been there for more than a few months.\\xa0“This is relaxed compared to other factories,” said Xu Na, 30, who followed her younger brother to work at the factory. “We never work more than 60 hours.”\\n\\n\\nFlipkart is in the middle of a crisis of its own making—stalled growth compounded by management churn and the imminent possibility that it will cede the top slot to Amazon. But it’s not too late to change its strategy. Flipkart is in the middle of a storm of its own making: It is faced with a significant management churn at the top. For a company that pioneered e-commerce in the country, growth has virtually stalled since the middle of last year and the leadership team hasn’t figured out a way to kick-start sales. Its innovation engine isn’t firing. In e-commerce lingo, the gross merchandise volume (GMV) sold over a given period of time has not grown substantially. In the offline world, it is the equivalent of saying, the sales or revenue numbers aren’t growing. And this, for the e-commerce pioneer that until now grew its GMV by over 200% per annum for the past three years. The very culture that made Flipkart a runaway success in the first phase of its existence is now hindering its progress. The battle won’t be easy. Amazon will unleash Amazon Prime, Amazon Fresh and may even partner with offline retailers to consolidate its position as the default destination for online shopping. Amazon has rapidly scaled up its seller ecosystem and outstrips Flipkart today in several product categories. It has a chance to win India—and that is being handed over on a platter thanks to the internal confusion at Flipkart. Amazon is here to play a 20 year game—and any fumbles will cost competitors heavily. Now imagine the Flipkart investors’ dilemma. They’ve poured in over $3 billion and own over 80% of the company. They are neck deep in a business that is burning $50-70 million a month and has to get ready for the next phase of battle in the market. If the cost-cutting moves misfire and market share starts to shrink, the founders could very well put a request for another $500 million for the fight against Amazon. What will the investors do? A new investor is unlikely to step in. Even though the Chinese e-commerce players like Alibaba are waiting in the wings to swoop down on prized assets in India, there\\'s a chance that they could choose to wait out this stage of the company’s evolution—why buy and restructure, when you can wait and buy a cleaned-up asset? Hence, one of the current investors will have to lead the round and it will put serious pressure on the team to show results. Flipkart has a last chance to redeem itself and take control of its destiny, else it will become another victim of early success. It is too big to fail and the market opportunity is too large to ignore. India will have more than one large e-commerce player—just the sheer potential of the market will keep it from consolidating for many years—and so, Flipkart’s existence is not in question. But the next few months will determine the destiny of the company. The A-team cannot afford to flounder so early in their journey.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Services Shut Down in China in Startling About-Face:\\xa0For years, there has been a limit to the success of American technology companies in China. Capture too much market share or wield too much influence, and Beijing will push back.\\xa0Apple has largely been an exception to that trend. Yet the Silicon Valley company is now facing a regulatory push against its services in China that could signal its good relations in the country may be turning.\\xa0Last week, Apple’s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in China, just six months after they were started there. Initially, Apple apparently had the government’s approval to introduce the services. But then a regulator, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, asserted its authority and demanded the closings, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The about-face is startling, given Apple’s record in China. Unlike many other American tech companies, Apple has succeeded in introducing several new products — like its mobile payments system Apple Pay — in China recently. New resistance from the Chinese government to that expansion could potentially hurt the Cupertino, Calif., company.\\xa0To a degree more than many tech companies, Apple relies on the smooth operation of its software — including its App Store and services like iTunes, which are tightly integrated with the iPhone and iPad — to keep customers coming back to its devices. Apple, which is facing a slowdown in sales of its iPhones, is also reliant on China for growth, so further moves by Beijing to curtail services could crimp sales.\\xa0The company counts China as its second-largest market after the United States. Its China numbers will be dissected on Tuesday, when it reports quarterly earnings.\\xa0China’s pushback against Apple shows that the company may finally be vulnerable to the heightened scrutiny that other American tech companies have faced in recent years. That scrutiny was spurred by revelations from the former United States National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden in 2013 of the use of American companies to conduct cyberespionage for Washington.\\xa0China has sweeping goals in its move against Apple, said Daniel H. Rosen, founding partner of Rhodium Group, a New-York based advisory firm specializing in the Chinese economy.\\xa0“They are interested in protecting the content that the Chinese people see, policing its national security and favoring indigenous giants such as Huawei, Alibaba and Tencent,” Mr. Rosen said. In this new era, he added, China “is strongly disinclined to accept the dominance of foreign players on the Internet, not least those from the United States.” Sales in China for those companies, including Cisco, IBM, Microsoft and Qualcomm, have slid as government oversight has increased. Some have grappled with raids, investigations and fines. Some have also been pressured to sell off holdings, hand over technology and work with local partners to expand their China businesses.\\xa0Though Apple is one of the eight, it has had a much easier time - so far.\\n\\n\\nDell’s SecureWorks stumbles in first tech IPO of the year:\\xa0It has been a dry year for tech IPOs. Up until today’s SecureWorks offering, there had been zero in the U.S. in 2016. Zero. This compares to seven in the same period last year and 24 in that timeframe the year before.\\xa0So tech investors and late-stage private companies were watching SecureWorks closely, to see if the tech IPO window would reopen. It is one of the few indications we have right now to assess public investor appetite for tech IPOs. Unfortunately, SecureWorks faltered.The unicorn-sized security company split from Dell, although the computer manufacturer remains its majority owner. SecureWorks raised $112 million in the offering, after pricing its IPO at $14 per share. But the company was expecting the initial price to be between $15.50-$17.50. SecureWorks closed the day at $13.88, beneath the $14 IPO price. The offering certainly did not assuage concerns about the current environment for tech IPOs.\\n\\n\\nWomen’s coding school Hackbright Academy acquired for $18 million:\\xa0Hackbright Academy, the San Francisco-based coding school for women, has been acquired by Capella Education for $18 million as the publicly traded education company looks to expand its efforts to train more women in technical careers.Hackbright, which was started in 2012, has graduated 364 women from its 12-week full-time fellowship programs. Another 279 women have graduated from its part-time program. Capella, meanwhile, is based in Minneapolis and specializes in degree programs for working adults, three quarters of whom are women.\\xa0The deal closed Friday, the companies said, with all of Hackbright’s 25 employees joining Capella. Hackbright CEO Sharon Wienbar will continue to lead the team, reporting to Gilligan. Hackbright will continue to focus its efforts on in-person trainings exclusively for women, Wienbar said.\\n\\n\\nIn Asia, Netflix trips on regulation, content, and competition: Months after its global rollout, Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) is facing problems in several major Asian markets as it struggles to provide enough strong content to attract consumers amid tough local competition, and also faces many regulatory hurdles, underlining concerns about disappointing subscriber numbers reported this week. From complaints that programming libraries offered in many countries are far smaller than in the United States to delays in offering its signature \"House of Cards\" series in some markets due to rights issues, the U.S. video streaming giant\\'s January launch into 130 new markets worldwide, including a slew in Asia, has been bumpy. When it launched in Indonesia in January, for example, Netflix ran afoul of the film censorship board for carrying content deemed inappropriately violent or sexual. The communications ministry also demanded that Netflix set up a local office and pay Indonesian taxes.Netflix is still available in Indonesia via wifi connections and other carriers.In South Korea, where local content is popular and consumers have numerous streaming options, the Netflix site offers fewer than 20 local TV shows or movies.\"Korean Netflix\\'s library in terms of content is pretty thin,\" said Jung Dong-yoon, a 29-year-old Seoul office worker and subscriber since January.Netflix had an explosive start in Australia, counting nearly 3 million Australians as viewers, OUT OF A population of 24 million, within nine months of its March 2015 launch. But growth has slowed just as dramatically, from a 55 percent leap between April and May to a rise of 4 percent between September and October, according to Roy Morgan research.\\n\\n\\nTipping Is Coming to Uber, and It’s Going to Be Awkward:\\xa0Uber\\'s mega settlement of as much as $100 million helps it solve a major legal liability around workforce classification, but another piece of the agreement could make for some uncomfortable situations in the near future.\\xa0As part of the settlement with drivers in California and Massachusetts, Uber has agreed to notify customers more clearly that tips are not included in fares and give tacit approval for optional gratuity. Drivers can now solicit cash tips by asking passengers or posting signs in their vehicles. Shannon Liss-Riordan, a lawyer representing the drivers, said riders should start seeing gratuities as a major part of an Uber driver\\'s income. In other words, more like a cabbie. “I believe that, with this information, many riders will begin tipping their drivers, which will increase drivers’ pay substantially,” she said in a statement to the court.\\xa0In the past, Uber tried to discourage tipping. During the company’s early days, its website said in 2011 that tips were included. Drivers complained that Uber was making its fares seem lower than they really were by rolling in a tip. In any case, they argued that Uber shouldn’t take a cut of the portion of the fare that was classified as a tip. The company eventually changed the way it described the cost of the ride. It currently says there’s no need to tip.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlphabet’s Earnings Miss Forecasts:\\xa0European regulators brought the hammer down on Google this week, and investors barely blinked. But when the company’s first-quarter numbers came in a little light on Thursday afternoon, its stock immediately plummeted.\\xa0Both revenue and profit rose sharply from 2015 but missed analysts’ forecasts. Revenue, at $20.26 billion, was about $120 million less than expected. Earnings per share, excluding certain items, were $7.50 when the consensus estimate was $7.96.\\xa0The result: The stock fell about $46, or about 6 percent, in after-hours trading.\\xa0Shares of Google were priced for perfection, and the first quarter was a little less than perfect. Whether that means anything substantive is more doubtful.Revenue from what the company calls “Other Bets” — including its fiber business and the Nest thermostat — was $166 million, more than double what it was in the first quarter of 2015. Losses for Other Bets rose to $802 million from $633 million.\\xa0The number of employees jumped to 64,000 from 55,000 last year. “The vast majority” of them, the company stressed, were engineers and product managers. A question hanging over Google is its ventures in cloud computing. This is the growth market where Amazon is far ahead of everyone. Amazon Web Services is more exciting to investors than the retailer’s core business. Microsoft, meanwhile, is mounting an aggressive challenge.\\xa0Google is far behind at No. 3, or perhaps even No. 4 after IBM, said John R. Rymer, an analyst at Forrester Research. Last fall, Google hired Diane Greene, an industry veteran, to run all of its cloud businesses.\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft’s Cloud Business, Seen as a Salvation, Falls Short of Investors’ Hopes:\\xa0Cloud computing is seen by many investors as Microsoft’s salvation, the growing business that has convinced many there’s a bright future for the company beyond the troubled PC market.\\xa0But Microsoft’s cloud business didn’t grow quite fast enough during its last quarter to keep investors happy. The company missed Wall Street estimates, though Microsoft executives said it would have beaten them without the impact of unexpectedly high taxes.\\xa0For its fiscal third quarter, which ended March 31, Microsoft reported net income of $3.76 billion, or 47 cents a share, down from $4.99 billion, or 61 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue fell to $20.53 billion, from $21.73 billion.\\xa0Microsoft’s traditional profit engines, like Windows, have weakened considerably as sales in the PC market have remained in a multiyear slump. Last week, the research firm Gartner reported that worldwide PC shipments in the first quarter fell 9.6 percent from a year ago. Yet Microsoft has convinced many investors that it has found a way to adapt to technology changes, in part by vigorously embracing cloud computing. Shares of Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., are still trading near their price in 1999, their high, even with a 5 percent drop in value Thursday evening.\\xa0The optimism stems from its success in transitioning legacy software businesses like Office to a cloud business model in which customers subscribe to the applications. There are now 22.2 million subscribers to Office 365, the subscription version of its Office business, up from 12.4 million a year ago.\\n\\n\\nEv Williams’s Medium raised $57 million in September — now it’s raised another $50 million:\\xa0You may have heard there’s a tech funding crunch, especially for companies that have yet to generate significant revenue.\\xa0Not for Medium: The publishing platform says it raised another $50 million — just a few months after it raised $57 million. Update: Investors valued the company at $600 million in the current round, said a person familiar with the financing.\\xa0This round was led by Spark Capital and includes previous investors Andreessen Horowitz and Google Ventures.\\xa0CEO Ev Williams, whose stake in Twitter has made him a billionaire, is also putting money into his own company\\n\\n\\nAmazon is shutting down its Gilt Groupe competitor MyHabit:\\xa0Another unhappy ending for a flash-sale shopping site.\\xa0Three months after Gilt Groupe sold for a fraction of its valuation, Amazon has decided to shut down its fashion discount competitor MyHabit, according to a person familiar with the move. Amazon launched the website five years ago near the height of the flash-sale craze, but MyHabit has struggled in recent years as the one-time popular fashion niche has become less popular and Amazon has prioritized other fashion initiatives.\\xa0Women’s Wear Daily reported employees have been told that the site will shutter at the end of May (subscription). In January, the CEO of MyHabit took on a new role at Amazon as general manager of its new private-label fashion business, according to his LinkedIn profile.Flash sales, on the other hand, has become an increasingly difficult business in recent years. The model exploded in popularity following the last recession, as designer brands were desperate to sell excess inventory in any way they could. But as the economy rebounded, there was less excess inventory to go around and some brands got smarter about how much inventory they produced.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook considers letting users add a tip jar to make money from posts:\\xa0Facebook is exploring new ways for individual users to profit from their posts on the network, The Verge has learned. A user survey distributed this week hints at a broad range of ways that users could make money or promote a cause, including a tip jar, branded content and taking a cut of the ad revenue Facebook earns from posts. The survey also asked users to indicate their interest in a “call to action” button, a way to let followers make donations and a “sponsor marketplace” to match users with advertisers. It’s unclear whether Facebook is considering making these options available to all users; the language of the survey indicated it is targeted at verified users. The survey was spotted on the page of a verified user with a relatively small following. (Okay, it was me.)\\xa0Facebook does not currently offer individual users a way to earn money by posting on Facebook. It has allowed publishers to sell advertising inside its fast-loading Instant Articles format, and recently clarified rules allowing posts sponsored by brands to be shared by verified pages. Facebook is also testing ads within the suggestions that pop up after you watch a video, sharing money with publishers. But recently, the company has taken steps to make its publishing tools more widely available. In February, the company began letting anyone publish Instant Articles.\\n\\n\\nLine\\'s Plan to Outflank Facebook in Asia: Think Local:\\xa0Line Corp. has an instant message for Facebook Inc.: Asia is ours. Country by country, the chat app from Japan is signing up new users by adopting a different strategy in each place. In its home market, cute bunny and bear stickers drew in everyone from schoolgirls to suit-clad businessmen. In Indonesia, Line built a classmate-connecting service after learning that alumni networks are a powerful social glue there. In Muslim countries, Line rolled out special features for people observing the Ramadan fast. All of this is aimed at getting new users hooked onto Line before they have a chance to become loyal to a rival service, such as Facebook\\'s Messenger and WhatsApp, or China\\'s WeChat. That, along with Line\\'s knack for making money from its app, bolsters the company\\'s plan to hold an initial public offering as soon as this year. Line, a subsidiary of South Korean Internet company Naver Corp, now has more than 215 million monthly active users.\\xa0One of Line\\'s biggest foes in Asia is Tencent Holdings\\'s WeChat, which boasts 697 million users. In some ways, WeChat is more than a just messaging service, with a myriad of features that let people book car rides, find dates and exchange money—all from within the app. Line isn\\'t just good at reeling in new users, it also knows how to make money off of them. A third of the company\\'s 120.7 billion yen ($1.1 billion) in 2015 revenue came from virtual-sticker sales. Idezawa also appears to have figured out how to make advertising work inside a messaging app. Under one marketing program, companies can pay 40 million yen to give customers access to sponsored stickers for two weeks. People are more likely to pay attention to ads if they appear while chatting with friends, Idezawa says. Line is also targeting other Southeast Asian countries, the Middle East and even South America. The company now has 3,800 employees (average age, 31) supporting services in 19 languages. In order to snag local users, Idezawa dispatches teams of engineers, designers, marketers and business developers to each new country—they are empowered to come up with new features and services that appeal to those markets. For example, in Latin America, Line rolled out a selfie app called B612, which now has more than 50 million users.\\xa0Facebook, for its part, is keeping WhatsApp—a no-frills service with 1 billion users—just the way it is, even after buying the messaging app for $22 billion in 2014. At the same time, Facebook has started to add features to Messenger, the companion to its social-networking website, letting people book car rides, read news and, yes, download stickers.\\n\\n\\nGot a Hot Seller on Amazon? Prepare for E-Tailer to Make One Too:\\xa0Rain Design has been selling an aluminum laptop stand on Amazon.com Inc. for more than a decade. A best-seller in its category, the $43 product has a 5-star rating and 2,460 customer reviews. In July, a similar stand appeared at about half the price. The brand: AmazonBasics. Since then, sales of the Rain Design original have slipped. “We don’t feel good about it,” says Harvey Tai, the company’s general manager. “But there’s nothing we can do because they didn’t violate the patent.” Rain Design’s experience shows how Amazon is using insights gleaned from its vast Web store to build a private-label juggernaut that now includes more than 3,000 products -- from women’s blouses and men’s khakis to fire pits and camera tripods. The strategy is a digital twist on one used for years by department stores and big-box chains to edge out middlemen and go direct to consumers -- boosting loyalty and profits.\\xa0At first, AmazonBasics -- launched in 2009 -- focused on batteries, recordable DVDs and such. Then for several years, the house brand “slept quietly as it retained data about other sellers’ successes,” according to the report. But in the past couple of years, AmazonBasics has stepped up the pace, rolling out a range of products that seem perfectly tailored to customer demand.\\xa0In his annual shareholder letter earlier this month, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos said Amazon is the “best place in the world to fail.” That philosophy applies to private-label products, which quickly disappear if they receive poor customer ratings. About 96 percent of AmazonBasics products had a rating of 3.5 stars or more, according to the Skubana report. The authors’ advice to merchants: “If you have a product that is lower than 3.5 stars, that product is dead to you and your customers. Liquidate and move on.”\\xa0Amazon’s size gives it an advantage over so-called direct-to-consumer startups such as mattress seller Casper and eyewear merchant Warby Parker because Amazon can experiment with one product rather than having to build out an entire line. If an item flops, it’s no big deal.\\xa0Amazon isn’t only copying products made by small, little-known merchants like Rain Design. Its private-label lines are increasingly competing with name brands, and nowhere is that happening more than in apparel.\\n\\n\\nReview: Curb, energy monitoring for an entire home:\\xa0Curb is a comprehensive household energy monitoring system. The system monitors the entire home by using sensors installed in the circuit breaker. For many consumers this means being able to monitor the energy consumed by a clothes dryer or electric range or all the outlets and lights in a bedroom. It cannot, however, easily monitor and report how much energy is consumed by a computer or espresso machine.\\xa0I had the system installed in my house over a month ago. It took licensed electrician about three hours. He had to install a sensor on each breaker and configure the system through an iPad app. This is not something an average homeowner can install themselves and that’s kind of the point.\\xa0Curb aims to serve a homeowner with data not previously available. Other energy monitoring services either monitor the entire home or individual outlets. Curb sits in the middle of the two at the circuit break box. Each breaker gets a sensor and an app can display real-time consumption information as well as a dollar approximation of how much the energy is costing the homeowner. But what do I do with all this data? That’s where the system stops being useful. Obviously I can stop using my electric dryer and hang the clothes outside. Or teach my kids to turn off their lights. But I need help from there.\\xa0The system should be able to display more historical data. Right now all it can do is show how much energy a particular circuit consumed — but now a total amount of watts. It can show how much power a home has consumed over a set of dates and also what the average was during that period. But what about the individual circuits? I want the system to let me dial down to a granule level.\\xa0The web and smartphone app are basic at this point. The founder tells me the company is working towards implementing new features. The team is also playing with weekly emails that gives the consumer a breakdown of their energy usage and if anything abnormal occurred. Apparently, according to him, the system can identify when an appliance is consuming extra electricity, which could be a sign that it is nearing the end of its life.\\xa0Currently, just after launch, the user experience of Curb leaves me wanting more. It is collecting so much information about my energy usage yet I feel it’s not benefiting me in a major way. Of course I should use appliances less.Yet the system shows a lot of promise in surprising ways.\\xa0A few weeks family and I were standing in line for the Easter Bunny. This was the day before Easter so we were in line for over an hour. And like any good parent, I spent the time putzing around on my phone. Mindlessly, I opened the Curb app and discovered the stove was drawing power though I thought I had turned if off. I texted my neighbor who went over and discovered the oven was still on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntel to Cut 12,000 Jobs as PC Demand Slumps:\\xa0Intel, the world’s largest maker of semiconductors, said on Tuesday that it was laying off 12,000 people, about 11 percent of its work force, as it continues to reel from a long downturn in global demand for personal computers. Intel, the world\\'s largest chipmaker, lowered its revenue forecast for the year. It now expects revenue to rise in mid-single digits, down from its previous forecast of mid- to high-single digits.\\xa0Intel\\'s shares were down 2.2 percent at $30.90 in extended trading. Net revenue rose to $13.70 billion from $12.78 billion.\\xa0Non-GAAP net revenue came in at $13.80 billion, compared with analysts\\' average estimate of $13.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Adjusted earnings of 54 cents per share topped Wall Street forecasts of 48 cents.\\xa0Up to Tuesday\\'s close, Intel\\'s shares had fallen 8.4 percent this year. Yet Intel still gets 60 percent of its revenue from chips supplied to PCs, and its profit margins there are not as good as in data center chips, its other major business. The company’s other businesses have small profits, or else lose money.\\xa0That means PCs are still core to what Intel does. Most of the layoffs, along with things like consolidating facilities and cut projects, are expected to be inside the PC business. Employees who are affected by the restructuring will be notified in the next 60 days, the company said. The layoffs are the largest since 2006, when the company let go 10,500 employees.\\n\\n\\nVerizon set to make Yahoo\\'s bidder short list, as Yahoo reports tepid earnings:\\xa0Verizon Communications Inc was set on Tuesday to advance to the second stage of bidding for Yahoo Inc\\'s core assets, as the U.S. internet company went through offers to put together a short list, people familiar with the matter said. The field had whittled down ahead of Monday\\'s first-round bid deadline as several companies that were mulling an offer, including Comcast Corp and Time Inc, decided to opt out, the people said. Meanhile, Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, California, said revenue fell 11 percent to $1.09 billion, and its net loss was $99 million, or 10 cents a share, in contrast to revenue of $1.23 billion and net income of $21 million, or 2 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago.\\n\\n\\nCredit Suisse Says Instagram Is Going to Have a Huge Year:\\xa0Facebook Inc.\\'s purchase of Instagram Inc. continues to look smarter and smarter. After buying Instagram for $1 billion in 2012, analysts at Credit Suisse Group AG now expect Facebook will get more than triple that price tag in revenue from the photo sharing app this year alone. \"We are now forecasting $572.5 million and [circa] $3.2 billion in revenue contribution from Instagram in [the first quarter of 2016] and 2016, respectively,\" analysts led by Stephen Ju said in a recent note. Instagram and premium video will be a big driver for mobile and desktop ad revenue, the team writes. \"Our projection for consolidated ad revenue of $5.24 billion in [the first quarter] reflects our projection for $573 million and $260 million in contribution from Facebook\\'s Instagram and premium video ad product, respectively.\" \\xa0When Facebook acquired the startup, it had roughly 30 million users. Monthly active users have now ballooned to 400 million as of September 2015, topping that of Twitter Inc. Much of the recent expansion has been outside of the U.S.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n')\n",

The figure also represents a decrease from the 2.4 million members the streaming service added internationally in the same period the previous year.\\xa0That cloudy forecast sent shares down more than 10 percent in after-hours trading, as Netflix has tied its future to its bold global push. The company has been pouring resources into its expanding its international footprint, telling investors that it would run at break-even profitability until the end of 2016 as it continued to roll out the service abroad and increased its investment in content. That uncertainty over the competitive landscape, as well as fears about growth prospects both inside and outside the United States, overshadowed the generally positive first-quarter financial results that Netflix announced on Monday.\\xa0The company beat expectations for profit and revenue growth during the first quarter. Profits totaled $28 million, up 16 percent from the same period last year, and total revenues increased 24 percent to nearly $2 billion.\\xa0Netflix added a record 6.7 million total streaming members during the first quarter, bringing its total to 81.5 million, with about 42 percent outside the United States. Netflix had forecast that it would reach nearly 80.9 million total paid members in the quarter.\\xa0In the United States, Netflix surpassed its forecasts for subscriber growth during a period in which price increases went into effect for some customers. The company added 2.23 million subscribers in America during the quarter, bringing its paid membership in the country to 45.7 million.\\xa0Outside the United States, Netflix also beat its expectations for growth, adding 4.5 million international streaming subscribers.\\xa0The company said it was planning to spend more than $6 billion on programming in 2017, up from $5 billion this year.\\n\\n\\nIBM reports worst revenue in 14 years, shares slide:\\xa0IBM on Monday reported a 21 percent decline in net profit from continuing operations, to $2.3 billion in the first quarter that ended March 31. Its operating earnings per share fell 19 percent, to $2.35 a share, though that was above the average estimate of Wall Street analysts of $2.09 a share, as complied by Thomson Reuters. The company’s first-quarter revenue declined 5 percent, to $18.7 billion. But that was ahead of analysts’ consensus forecast of $18.29 billion. After adjusting for the impact of currency translation, revenue was down 2 percent. IBM shares fell about 5 percent in after-hours trading, a retreat from a recent uptrend for the stock. In the first three months of this year, IBM’s stock price had increased 17 percent. IBM delivered a quarterly performance that shows the steady headway it is making in new businesses led by cloud computing and data-analysis software, like its Watson artificial intelligence technology.\\xa0But the company’s transformation remains very much a work in progress. The erosion of some of its hardware and software products continues to be a drag on growth and profits, overshadowing the gains in the new fields.\\n\\n\\nLinkedIn built a new app for college kids - from which Lynda is missing:\\xa0In an effort to lure more young people to its professional network, LinkedIn built a standalone app specifically for college students.\\xa0The app helps students quickly create a profile (if they don’t already have one), find career paths and job postings that relate to their major, and connect with alumni who studied the same topic. The app is appropriately named “LinkedIn Students.”\\xa0LinkedIn’s challenge is that its product is most useful once you already have a job. Or at least know a bunch of other people who do. Oftentimes, college students have neither, which makes the idea of creating a profile seem overwhelming, said Ada Yu, a product manager at LinkedIn. So LinkedIn is trying to appeal to young people with an app that’s less cumbersome than its flagship app. LinkedIn users can already do most of what the college app offers in LinkedIn’s main app; it’s just more simplified now. Two things worth noting:\\xa0Lynda.com, the online library of classes LinkedIn bought for $1.5 billion last year, is noticeably missing from the app. It seems likely that LinkedIn will add online classes to the app at some point.\\xa0LinkedIn can make money from this app. Once students scroll past the daily job and alumni recommendations, they get to an “extra credit” section which will include some branded content. LinkedIn will launch with branded content from J.P. Morgan. What LinkedIn will not do, however, is recommend career paths or job openings in exchange for cash. All suggested jobs will be based on LinkedIn’s algorithm, Yu said.\\n\\n\\nChina\\'s Crowded Smartphone Market Heads for an Epic Shakeout:\\xa0Smartphone sales in China exploded earlier this decade as incomes rose, prices for chips and displays plummeted, and carriers offered arrays of discounts. Shelves were flooded with hundreds of brands—from national heavyweights Huawei, Lenovo and Xiaomi to the smaller Dakele, Tecno Mobile and Gionee.\\xa0Shipments more than doubled in each of the three years ending 2012, according to researcher Canalys. Xiaomi\\'s valuation rocketed to $45 billion, and the phone maker started selling devices in India, the world’s fastest-growing major economy. Lenovo Group Ltd. spent $2.91 billion to acquire Motorola Mobility to help make it \"a global player.\"\\xa0In 2011, only four of the top 10 vendors in China were domestic. Last year, there were eight. \\xa0Now that wave has crested. Smartphones no longer are novelties in China, and most domestic brands target the mid- and low-price ranges, where buyers don\\'t upgrade as frequently as those for high-end Apple and Samsung phones. China\\'s herd of 300 phone makers may be halved in 12 months by competition, a sales plateau and economic growth that\\'s the slowest in a quarter-century, according to executives and analysts.\\xa0\"The mobile-phone industry changed more quickly and brutally than expected,\" Dakele Chief Executive Officer Ding Xiuhong said on his Weibo messaging account. \"As a startup, we couldn’t find more strategies and methods to break through.\"\\n\\n\\nDon’t want your startup to fail? Arianna Huffington tells founders to go to bed:\\xa0Sleep deprivation is the undoing of startup founders, according to Arianna Huffington.\\xa0“There is this kind of founder myth that if you are a founder you can’t afford to get enough sleep,” she told me over the phone while catching a plane back to New York. “The truth is three-quarters of startups fail and if founders got more sleep they’d have a better chance of succeeding.”\\xa0Wanting to get more sleep isn’t the problem for most of us. It’s fitting in the recommended seven to 9 hours of sleep with work, eating, exercise, relationships and a social life – and on top of that founders need to spend a lot of time growing their fledgling company. The advice is obvious – no caffeine after 2 pm and keep your bedroom dark and quiet – but like exercise and eating right, a lot of us probably don’t do it anyway.\\xa0And sacrifices will be made – no tech in the bedroom and you might not get through all of those critically acclaimed Netflix dramas – Arianna tells me she’s only seen one episode of House of Cards because sleep is the priority.\\xa0But then, maybe you’ll think clearly and your startup won’t fail.\\n\\n\\n\\nMedia Websites Battle Faltering Ad Revenue and Traffic:\\xa0\\xa0This month, Mashable, a site that had just raised $15 million, laid off 30 people. Salon, a web publishing pioneer, announced a new round of budget cuts and layoffs. And BuzzFeed, which has been held up as a success story, was forced to bat back questions about its revenue — but not before founders at other start-up media companies received calls from anxious investors.\\xa0“It is a very dangerous time,” said Om Malik, an investor at True Ventures whose tech news site, Gigaom, collapsed suddenly in 2015, portending the flurry of contractions.\\xa0The trouble, the publishers say, is twofold. The web advertising business, always unpredictable, became more treacherous. And website traffic plateaued at many large sites, in some cases falling — a new and troubling experience after a decade of exuberant growth.\\xa0Online publishers have faced numerous financial challenges in recent years, including automated advertising and ad-blocking tools. But now, there is a realization that something more profound has happened: The transition from an Internet of websites to an Internet of mobile apps and social platforms, and Facebook in particular, is no longer coming — it is here.\\xa0It is a systemic change that is leaving many publishers unsure of how they will make money.\\xa0“With each turn of the screw, people began to realize, viscerally, that this is what it feels like to not be in control of your destiny,” said Scott Rosenberg, a co-founder of Salon who left the company in 2007.\\xa0Audiences drove the change, preferring to refresh their social feeds and apps instead of visiting website home pages. As social networks grew, visits to websites in some ways became unnecessary detours, leading to the weakened traffic numbers for news sites. Sales staffs at media companies struggled to explain to clients why they should buy ads for a fragmented audience rather than go to robust social networks instead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook’s ambitious plan to make you a VR convert:\\xa0Alongside announcements about drones, bots and other plans to use its Messenger app to take over the world, Facebook also spent quite a bit of time talking about virtual reality. The company, of course, is the owner of Oculus — the VR firm with the most general recognition — and just released its first commercial VR headset, the Rift. The Rift is focused on gaming right now, but Facebook has been saying since it bought Oculus in 2014 that it has broader plans for making Oculus\\'s technology work for more general social interaction. Sheikh laid out a world where users could play a poker game with friends over VR that is so sensitive that you can read their tells. He describes what it could mean to people who live far away from their families to be able to interact with them through a headset. And he said that eventually his team hopes to make VR social interaction \"indistinguishable from real life.\" Of course, this will all take a lot of work. Right now, the commercial Rift doesn\\'t even represent your hands in VR, though that is poised to changebefore the year is out. But Sheikh also described research that would let users put their whole bodies in a virtual world and accurately map facial expressions. The team is also trying to analyze real-world social interactions, to figure out how to let virtual interactions flow as seamlessly as in-person meetings.\\xa0He also warned that all the visions he laid out in his portion of the keynote speech were far from ready for prime-time. A study released Wednesday by Greenlight VR predicted that it will take six to eight years for virtual reality to go fully mainstream. Given all the research that Sheikh said had to be completed to make social presence really work during the Facebook keynote, that sort of timeline could actually seem a little ambitious.\\n\\n\\nKahoot App Brings Urgency of a Quiz Show to the Classroom:\\xa0Kahoot, an online quiz system from Norway that is fast gaining market share in schools across the United States, plays out like a television game show spliced with a video game.\\xa0Cast in the role of game host, teachers introduce a multiple-choice quiz — on, say, plant life or English grammar. Using the Kahoot platform, they project one quiz question at a time onto a whiteboard or screen at the front of their classrooms.\\xa0Players typically have 30 seconds to click an answer on their laptops, tablets or smartphones. They earn points for correct choices, and extra points for clicking faster.\\xa0During the answer period, Kahoot emits a catchy countdown tune, reminiscent of retro video games like Monkey Island. A gong sounds when time is up, and the classroom board immediately tallies the class’s correct and incorrect answers. Next, a leaderboard appears, ranking the top five students by points accrued.\\xa0Kahoot’s gamelike features and easy-to-use format have helped turn it into a classroom phenomenon. Of the 55 million elementary and secondary school students in the United States, about 20 million used Kahoot last month, the company said.\\xa0“It’s fun. Everyone is doing it. It pulls all the children in,” Tosh McGaughy, a digital learning specialist at the Birdville Independent School District in Haltom City, Tex., told me recently. “They get competitive and excited.”\\n\\n\\nApple Falls on Report iPhone Output Cut for Second Quarter:\\xa0Apple \\xa0shares fell after it was reported that the company would extend an estimated 30 percent cut in iPhone production for another three months. Slower-than-expected sales of the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus have prompted Apple to reduce its orders, the Nikkei Asian Review reported, citing unidentified suppliers. The shares dropped as much as 2.1 percent and had declined 1.7 percent to $110.22 at 2:07 p.m. in New York. Apple introduced a smaller, cheaper handset dubbed the iPhone SE last month in an effort to plump up sales ahead of rolling out a new flagship model later this year. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., one of the biggest suppliers of chips to Apple, on Thursday forecast revenue below analysts’ estimates for the second quarter, saying that demand for smartphones that cost more than $500 is waning. “Ahead of the iPhone 7 people are holding onto their phones a little longer,” said Walter Piecyk, a New York-based analyst at BTIG LLC who recommends buying Apple shares. “But if this is as a result of lengthening product cycles then it could be a structural change for the industry.” In January, Apple said sales would decline for the first time in more than a decade. Global smartphone sales will rise by less than 10 percent this year, the smallest increase since the market’s inception, researcher Gartner Inc predicted last month. Nikkei reported that Apple cut iPhone production by an estimated 30 percent in the January to March quarter and that the reduction is being extended for the subsequent three months. Apple suppliers including Broadcom, Qorvo, Knowles and NXP Semiconductors also fell following the report.\\n\\n\\nTech Companies Face Greater Scrutiny for Paying Workers With Stock:\\xa0For the last few years, LinkedIn, the professional social networking company, has doled out increasingly large amounts of stock to pay its workers.\\xa0In 2014, LinkedIn paid employees $319 million in stock, or 14 percent of revenue; in 2015, that rose to $510 million, or 17 percent of revenue. At the time, those figures were largely met with shrugs from Wall Street.\\xa0Now that attitude may be changing.\\xa0As LinkedIn prepares to report its latest quarterly earnings next week, Wall Street is increasingly scrutinizing the number of stock grants that the company pays employees — especially after LinkedIn projected lower growth for this year and its stock price has fallen.\\xa0The Silicon Valley company’s stock-based compensation “provides additional reason to remain cautious” on LinkedIn, Mark May, an Internet analyst at Citigroup, wrote in a research note.\\xa0The issue is not limited to LinkedIn. With tech earnings season kicking off on Monday, investors are paying more attention to stock-based compensation at many tech companies.\\xa0Paying employees with stock is largely unquestioned when times are good, since the move theoretically aligns the interests of the workers with company performance. The practice is technically a corporate expense, but during boom periods, Wall Street typically focuses on a company’s operating results that exclude that expense.\\xa0Yet public tech companies have had a rockier time in the stock market this year. That has led investors to begin looking more closely at the quality of the companies’ financial results. The scrutiny means examining earnings with stock-based compensation expenses included — and certain financial measures, like earnings and margins, invariably look worse when that expense is factored in.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLyft Is Gaining on Uber as It Spends Big for Growth:\\xa0In January, Lyft said it raised $1 billion, which is helping fuel the spending spree and steal market share from Uber Technologies Inc. To keep costs in check, Lyft has promised investors to cap its losses at no more than $50 million a month, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the plans are private.Meanwhile, Uber has been working to fulfill its own promise to shareholders and employees that it would achieve profitability in North America by the second quarter of 2016, a milestone it says it has now reached in the U.S. and Canada. In February, Uber earned an average of 19¢ per ride in the U.S., according to previously undisclosed financial documents. Uber takes about a 25 percent cut of a typical fare, most of which goes to antifraud efforts, credit-card processing, customer support, marketing, and software development, the documents show. Not included in Uber’s profitability calculations are interest, taxes, or equity-based compensation for employees.\\xa0Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick’s commitment to profitability has left an opening for Lyft, and the smaller upstart’s free-spending strategy is starting to pay off. \\xa0Lyft says it has captured 45 percent of trips in Austin, Texas, and Los Angeles and 43 percent in San Francisco, where both companies are based. Uber says it had 55 percent of ride-hailing sales in Austin, 75 percent in Los Angeles, and 66 percent in San Francisco, citing third-party credit card data from the first two weeks of March. Uber says Lyft has shaken loose only a few percentage points. “From everything I’m looking at, we’re gaining share in all top 20 markets, which is where 80 percent to 90 percent of rides happen,” says Lyft President John Zimmer. “This continues to prove what we said all along, which is once you hit a certain level of scale, it’s a natural duopoly.”\\xa0Outside of big cities, though, it’s still Uber country. Of 169 million trips booked through Uber worldwide in March, the company says 50 million of those were in the U.S. Lyft says it did 11 million U.S. rides that month, up from 7 million in October.\\xa0Lyft continues to devise new—and often expensive—ways to expand in the U.S., the only country in which it operates. When a Lyft driver refers someone to sign up as a new driver, both get a $750 bonus in some cities. And Lyft has the capacity to keep spending. Zimmer says the company still has “by far the majority” of the $2 billion it’s raised from investors. “This allows us to control our own destiny. We do not need to raise any additional capital, and it’s just a fantastic position to be in.”\\xa0Whether Lyft’s gains will stick remains to be seen. Uber says customers lured away by subsidies are the most likely to return if Lyft’s prices go up. “It’s easy enough to buy trips with heavy subsidies for drivers and discounts for riders,” Jill Hazelbaker, a spokeswoman for Uber, wrote in an e-mail. “But to build a successful, long-term business, you need a path to profitability—which Uber has always had.”\\n\\n\\nRocket Internet Drops in Frankfurt Amid $222 Million Loss:\\xa0Rocket Internet SE, Europe’s biggest startup factory, fell the most in more than two months in Frankfurt trading after reporting a loss of 197.8 million euros ($222 million) for last year.\\xa0While Rocket-backed companies continued to increase sales, operating losses widened at several of them, including at food delivery startup HelloFresh and e-commerce site Lazada, which drew an investment from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. this week. Rocket had net income of about 429 million euros the previous year, according to the Berlin-based company’s statement Thursday. The shares fell 10 percent to 26.09 euros at 11:42 a.m. local time after dropping as much as 12 percent, the biggest intraday decline since Jan. 15.\\n\\n\\nWhatever Happened to Facebook’s Slack Competitor Facebook at Work?\\xa0Do you remember Facebook at Work? The version of Facebook specifically built for your office? The one that would send Slack and Yammer and email running for the hills?\\xa0We almost forgot, too. But hidden among the Internet-beaming drones and 360-degree video cameras Facebook showed off this week at its annual developer conference in San Francisco was a Facebook at Work booth, a small, unheralded reminder that the future of workplace communications is also on Facebook’s radar. Add it to the list. When we last spoke to Facebook about Work, the company was gearing up to launch a freemium version of the software to the masses before the end of 2015. It’s now mid-April 2016, and Facebook at Work is still in a closed beta.\\xa0So what happened? Is Facebook at Work still part of the game plan? So things are still moving. Just slowly. And that matters because Facebook’s top competition, tech startup Slack, is growing quickly in the interim. Facebook said it has 450 companies using the pilot, up from 100 in August, including some big companies like the Royal Bank of Scotland, which has more than 100,000 employees. More importantly, though, Facebook says it has 60,000 businesses that have signed up for its waiting list. That’s a lot of interested customers, but it’s unclear how many of them would actually pay for Work or use the free model.\\xa0Slack, for comparison, has more than two million users and more than 675,000 users who pay (or have employers who pay for them). That’s more than 100,000 new paid users since December, the same time we thought Facebook would be out on the open market.\\xa0Facebook has a tendency to turn small numbers into big numbers very quickly, so it’s not as though a few months’ delay means Facebook at Work can’t ultimately be a hit. But at a conference dedicated to Facebook’s future, Facebook at Work was a side note. And side notes can be hard to remember.\\n\\n\\nGoPro’s developer program aims to connect its cameras to cars, toys and apps:\\xa0GoPro on Thursday very quietly took the wraps off its new developer program, by which it hopes to get its action cameras hooked into as many third-party devices, vehicles and services as possible. The program was announced at a private event in San Francisco, where it showed off the fruits of various partnerships.\\xa0The Periscope integration announced earlier this year is an example of what the company is hoping to achieve. There was also a snap-on time-code system that you can use to sync your footage (announced last week, but still new), a mount for kids’ toys from Fisher-Price and add-ons for tracking your route and vital statistics when parasailing, skiing and other extreme activities — you get the general idea. Partnerships with BMW and Toyota also suggest more automotive applications in the future.\\xa0Perhaps the coolest item, shown off at the end of this highlight video, was a gesture-based camera control system for when your motorcycle gloves or [insert extreme garment here] prevent you from operating the app.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRegulators plan to revoke Theranos’ federal license and ban founder Elizabeth Holmes:\\xa0Theranos might find itself homeless soon. A federal agency plans to force founder Elizabeth Holmes out of her blood analysis startup for two years and take away the California lab’s federal license.\\xa0First reported in the Wall Street Journal, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services sent a letter dated March 18 proposing sanctions barring Holmes and company president Sunny Balwani from owning or running operations in labs for at least two years – including in \\xa0both California and Arizona – and taking away federal licensing for Theranos’ California facilities in Newark and Palo Alto after Theranos’ continued failure to correct major problems with accuracy and competence.\\xa0These actions would be a major financial blow to the startup valued at $9 billion. Theranos has the runway to keep working with approximately $700 million in the bank but the two labs make a good portion of the money for Theranos’ operations and a loss of the founder and president would strangle any hope of recovery.\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence for Everyday Use: How four programmers with almost no knowledge of Japanese designed software to read handwriting.\\xa0Real-world artificial-intelligence applications are popping up in unexpected places—and much sooner than you might think.\\xa0While winning a game of Go might be impressive, machine intelligence is also evolving to the point where it can be used by more people to do more things. That\\'s how four engineers with almost zero knowledge of Japanese were able to create software, in just a few months, that can decipher handwriting in the language.\\xa0The programmers at Reactive Inc. came up with an application that recognizes scrawled-out Japanese with 98.66 percent accuracy. The 18-month-old startup in Tokyo is part of a growing global community of coders and investors who are harnessing the power of neural networks to put AI to far more practical purposes than answering trivia or winning board games.\\xa0\"Just a few years ago, you had to be a genius to do this,\" said David Malkin, who has a Ph.D. in machine learning but can barely string two Japanese sentences together. \"Now you can be a reasonably smart guy and make useful stuff. Going forward, it will be more about using imagination to apply this to real business situations.\" While handwriting recognition might be considered deep-learning 101, Japanese is a whole other ballgame. That\\'s because the language includes symbolic characters such as kanji, which is composed of elements that can be read independently, making it difficult to know where one ends and another begins. There are also more than 2,000 common pictograms made up of dozens of strokes. The trick is to tackle one squiggle at a time. Reactive’s algorithm queries the neural network for a match, adds another stroke and repeats, all the while refining the probability of an accurate hit. The startup trained its model on about 1.8 million characters. Unlike a typical program built around rigid rules, deep-learning AI is modeled on how humans process information. Given enough data as inputs and a set of desired outputs, neural networks figure out what goes in the middle. This allows them to find solutions that have bedeviled traditional approaches, like interpreting speech or tagging images. And once built, a neural network doesn’t have to be limited to language applications. In their spare time, the four Reactive engineers showed the program 5,000 dresses downloaded from Google Images, then gave it a picture of a woman in a revealing outfit. \"Sexy clothes,\" the software responded.\\n\\n\\nSome Online Bargains May Only Look Like One:\\xa0Amazon has some unbelievable bargains on its virtual shelves. A cat litter pan with a list price of $2,159 can be yours for a mere $28. A bag of doggy treats, normally $822, is only $8. A windshield wiper blade, which the unwary pay $1,504 for, has been knocked down 99 percent. You say you don’t believe that a plastic cat pan could ever have been sold to anyone for a couple of thousand bucks? Or that a six-ounce bag of Zuke’s Lil’ Links pork and apple sausage bits ever cost more than dinner at a five-star restaurant? It’s all part of the bizarre world of Internet “discounts,” which let retailers and brands assert that you are getting a stupendous deal because someone somewhere else — exactly where is never explained — is being charged much more. Boomerang Commerce, a retail analytics firm, compared the list prices of dozens of pet items on Amazon and the specialist pet site Chewy.com. In only a handful of cases did the retailers even agree on what the list price was. So a 22-pound bag of Blue Buffalo Basics Limited Ingredient Grain-Free Duck and Potato dog food had a list price of $131 on Amazon and $84 on Chewy. Yet the retail price at both sites was the same: $49.49. “A perceived deeper discount creates a higher conversion event — in other words, more buyers,” said Boomerang’s chief executive, Guru Hariharan, who previously worked at Amazon. Another consultant, Ripen eCommerce, analyzed 746,000 product searches on Amazon. Ripen’s goal was to help third-party clients who sell on the giant retailer jockey for a better position — say, on the first page of results rather than further back. A little over 44 percent of the products — some sold directly by Amazon, others by third parties — were billed as discounted, Ripen said. “It’s less than I expected, actually,” said Dave Rekuc, Ripen’s director of marketing. “Considering you can basically name your own list price.”\\n\\n\\nVerizon bets on Armstrong, M&A savvy in Yahoo bid:\\xa0\\xa0Verizon is the clear favorite in the upcoming bidding for Yahoo\\'s core Internet business, according to Wall Street analysts, in large part because the telecommunications company\\'s efforts to become a force in Internet content have gone relatively well under the leadership of AOL Inc Chief Executive Tim Armstrong.\\xa0Verizon acquired AOL last June for $4.4 billion - its first big foray into the advertising-supported Internet business - and it is not yet clear how well the unit is performing financially. Subsequent moves, including the takeover of much of Microsoft Corp\\'s advertising technology business, a deal to buy Millennial Media for about $250 million and the recent launch of the mobile video service go90, are also too recent to assess.\\xa0Yet analysts have given the big phone company high marks for allowing AOL to operate independently and folding in other recent acquisitions without much drama. And they said Armstrong seems to be driving Verizon\\'s recent moves in go90 and recent acquisitions.\\xa0Verizon showed interest in Yahoo\\'s core business as early as December, when Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said the company would \"see if there is a strategic fit\" for Yahoo\\'s holdings, which include mail, news, sports and advertising technology.\\xa0Yahoo, under pressure from activist investors, launched an auction of its core business in February after it shelved plans to spin off its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.\\xa0The first round of bidding is slated for next week, and Verizon plans to make a bid, sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters.\\xa0Verizon is already working on increasing revenue through its ad-supported mobile video service go90, targeted at millennials and built on video streaming technology acquired from Intel in 2014.\\xa0The app, which launched in October, offers videos from Comedy Central and Vice, among others, as well as basketball and football games.\\xa0However, analysts cautioned that even a combined Yahoo-AOL would lack the unique data, such as user interests and tastes, that powers its rivals in online ads, chiefly Google and Facebook.\\xa0Armstrong, who made his name leading sales at Google, is highly regarded in the advertising community - in contrast to Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, another former Google high-flyer, who has been struggling to revive Yahoo. Mayer would likely leave after a Verizon-Yahoo deal, analysts sa\\n\\n\\n\\nMore Startups Are Getting Lower Valuations Than Joining the Billion-Dollar Club:\\xa0According to a new report from KPMG International and CB Insights, 2016 has seen a larger number of startups taking new lower valuations than those earning the billion-dollar badge. “The first quarter of 2016 has borne witness to high-profile unicorn company issues, layoffs, down rounds and mutual fund valuation markdowns,” according to the report. Only five venture capital–backed companies entered the $1 billion club in the same period, less than half the number from any quarter since the first quarter of 2015. Meanwhile, CB Insights’ Downround Tracker shows there were 19 \"down events\"—or companies raising new money or being acquired at a lower valuation—during that same time frame, including big names such as Foursquare Labs Inc., Gilt Groupe Inc., and Jawbone Inc. Those downgrades may also cause other startups to wait to raise new money if they anticipate having to take cuts themselves.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook Bets on a Bot Resurgence, Chattier Than Ever:\\xa0On Tuesday, Facebook underlined the rise of bots at its annual F8 developer conference in San Francisco. Facebook said it was opening up Messenger, its own messaging app, so that any outside company — from Applebee’s to Zara — could create a bot capable of interacting with people through the chat program.\\xa0With the move, Facebook is aiming to usher in a new era of customer service by bringing together the 900 million regular monthly users of Messenger with the more than 15 million businesses that have an official brand page on Facebook. Facebook is kicking off the project with partners like Spring, 1-800-Flowers, a weather and travel app called Poncho and news partners like CNN. Facebook is also testing advertising on chatbots as a potential source of revenue.\\xa0“We’re conversational creatures,” David A. Marcus, vice president of messaging at Facebook, said of chat. “That’s the way our brain functions. That’s the way we’re wired. As a result, it’s probably the most natural interface there is.”\\xa0Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, also sketched out his grand vision at the conference for the company’s future over the next five, 10 and 15 years. Under his plan, people would accompany Facebook as it builds out a comprehensive global system of communications, virtual reality and shopping.\\xa0“We all have a desire to be understood and relate to each other,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “We’re always trying to get closer to capturing the purest form.”\\xa0Facebook’s push into chatbots, which is part of that vision, follows other recent signs of bot life. Late last month, Microsoft released a bot called Tay that was designed to have discussions with people on Twitter — only to curtail the effort when people taught the software to repeat racist and other offensive remarks. Still, Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella,trumpeted bots days later at a developer conference, saying the software could be used to produce new methods of interaction.\\n\\n\\nFacebook built a 360-degree video camera, and it’s giving away the plans:\\xa0Facebook finally shipped its new Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, a niche product that will likely be as cool as the games and videos you’re able to use with it.\\xa0That means that Facebook has extra incentive (pressure?) to get people making great content for VR. At its F8 developer conference on Tuesday Facebook plans to unveil part of its plan to do just that: A new camera specifically for filming 360-degree videos, the kind of video that lets you pan or rotate within a scene so you can get a full 360-degree perspective. On top of the hardware, Facebook built a software program to stitch all the video together to create seamless 360-degree views of anything the filmmaker shoots.\\xa0There’s just one catch: You can’t actually buy this camera anywhere. That’s because Facebook isn’t mass producing or selling the camera to the public. Instead, it’s open sourcing the camera’s specs and design, meaning the info needed to build the camera will be available to the public so that anyone with the time and money could build it on their own. So why would Facebook build a fancy 360-degree video camera and hand over the blueprints? Because Facebook has no interest in mass producing another piece of hardware. It wants 360-degree video content, but it doesn’t need to manufacture a camera to get it. It just needs to show others how to make the camera instead. Oculus did something similar with the first version of its VR headset.\\xa0Facebook is into all kinds of video content, not just 360-degree video. It’s also making a big push into live video,paying celebrities and media companies to use it new live video feature and putting the tool front and center in its main Facebook app in hopes more people will use it.\\xa0The idea behind all of this is that getting more people to watch videos on Facebook will help the company sell video ads, which are more lucrative than static or banner ads.It isn’t the only company interested in 360-degree video either. Google partnered with GoPro a year ago for its own 360-degree camera, and it has been delayed by almost six months. Perhaps not coincidentally, Facebook’s 17-lens camera is one lens larger than Google’s 16-lens camera. Apparently size matters, even if you’re handing out the blueprints for free.\\n\\n\\nVietnam\\'s young tech talent pulls foreign funds to booming startup scene:\\xa0Vietnam\\'s tech startups are emerging as a force to be reckoned with as foreign private equity funds bet the country\\'s talented young brains will yield more successes like the international hit game Flappy Bird.\\xa0Just last month, financial powerhouses Goldman Sachs and Standard Chartered PLC raised their investment in the operator of e-wallet MoMo by $28 million, while Silicon Valley-based venture capitalist 500 Startups announced a $10 million Vietnam-focused fund.\\xa0One of 500 Startups\\' shoestring investments is in automated marketing service Beeketing, founded by college drop-out Truong Manh Quan, 26, who estimates revenue this year of $2 million predominantly from customers in the United States. The startup boom is the latest chapter of Vietnam\\'s growing presence in the global tech industry. In the three years since Hanoi-based .GEARS released Flappy Bird, Vietnam emerged from relative obscurity to become the Southeast Asian production hub of South Korean giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.\\xa0Meanwhile, global tech firms that have long had factories in Vietnam - such as LG Electronics Inc, Panasonic Corp, and Toshiba Corp - have also been expanding into research and development.\\xa0Part of Vietnam\\'s appeal is a cheaper workforce than in China, as well as membership of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade bloc and free trade deals with the European Union, plus incentives aimed at luring investment away from neighbors.\\xa0Of particular interest to venture capitalists, however, is Vietnam\\'s tech-savvy population with a median age of just 30.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba Expands in Southeast Asia With $1 Billion Lazada Deal:\\xa0Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is making its largest overseas investment with a $1 billion deal for control of Lazada Group SA, taking the Chinese e-commerce giant to Southeast Asia and closer to a goal of shedding its home-market reliance. China’s largest online emporium will pay $500 million for new shares in the closely held company and purchase an equal amount from existing investors, Alibaba said in a statement. Investors selling include Germany’s Rocket Internet SE, British supermarket chain Tesco Plc and Investment AB Kinnevik. The Chinese company is buying its way into a region on the cusp of an online shopping boom, as fast-growing mobile and Internet usage propels consumer spending. Billionaire Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma has set a goal of getting at least half the company’s revenue from overseas, with the Lazada deal adding sales of clothing and electronics in six Southeast Asian markets. While the deal is Alibaba’s biggest deal abroad to date, the e-commerce giant is no stranger to mega-acquisitions. It agreed to pay about $5 billion to take full control of Chinese video service Youku Tudou Inc. in 2015. Alibaba shares were little changed in U.S. trading at $77.86 and have dropped 4.2 percent this year.\\xa0The agreement values Lazada at $1.5 billion, Rocket said in a separate statement. It’s selling a 9.1 percent stake in Lazada and keeping an 8.8 percent slice. Alibaba’s deal values its entire stake in the company at about 15 times its total invested capital of 18 million euros ($21 million), the German technology company incubator said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Watch verdict a year later: Half of those surveyed think it’s a dud:\\xa0More than half of those surveyed by the advertising technology company Fluent said they considered the Apple Watch a flop.\\xa0That sentiment — expressed by the majority of the 2,578 adults in the U.S. who responded last week to an online survey — reflects how the device is perceived by the tech press and industry insiders, many of whom have been pessimistic about the Apple Watch from the start. Asked whether they considered the Watch a successful product for Apple, 53 percent responded “no.”\\xa0But Fluent’s survey also offers a more nuanced picture of Apple’s first wearable device,which launched on April 24, 2015. A significant majority of Apple Watch owners — 77 percent — consider the smartwatch a success and about two-thirds said they plan to upgrade when the next version comes out.\\xa0Those owners surveyed said they take advantage of a range of the smartwatch’s features, including monitoring their activity and receiving notifications (79 percent), listening to music (75 percent) and checking email or chat (66 percent). This survey supports the more comprehensive findings of Wristly’s “Pulse on Wristware,” released earlier this year. The research group, which surveys some 2,500 smartwatch and fitness band owners every week, says that despite some views of the Apple Watch as a “mediocre novelty,” it enjoys “astoundingly high customer satisfaction ratings.”\\n\\n\\nIsrael to Levy New Taxes on Google, Facebook in Policy Shift:\\xa0Israel has expanded its definition of who must pay taxes on commerce, targeting digital multinationals such as Facebook Inc. and Google that critics say get a free ride.\\xa0Because much of today’s trade is carried out on the Internet, a foreign firm may now be considered a “permanent establishment” and subject to tax even if most of its presence is virtual, the Israel Tax Authority said in an e-mailed statement. The authority said Internet multinationals will be required to pay value-added tax, which is 17 percent for Israelis. The new taxes, which take effect immediately, will eventually add hundreds of millions of shekels a year to state revenue, the authority said. A Google representative in Israel couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. Facebook “pays taxes according to the law in every country it operates, including Israel,” a spokeswoman said via e-mail.\\xa0Although Israel’s relatively small population of 8.5 million means the new taxes won’t clobber the international giants, they build on broader efforts worldwide to level the playing field between foreign Internet companies and local commerce. Russia is pushing to raise taxes on U.S. Internet companies to help its local industry and governments across Europe and beyond are trying to extract more revenue from Google, Apple Inc. and other multinationals with increasingly complex billing and ownership structures.\\n\\n\\nCloud-based video production platform 90 Seconds lands $7.5M Series A led by Sequoia India:\\xa0Despite the increasing ubiquity of online videos, making a professional-looking one is still a complicated process that usually involves chains of emails and uploads. 90 Seconds wants to fix that problem with its cloud-based platform, which lets users handle almost every part of the video production process in one place. Today, the startup announced it has raised a $7.5 million Series A led by Sequoia India.\\xa0Other investors in this round include pay television provider SKY TV New Zealand, Airtree Ventures, Beenext and Oleg Tscheltzoff, founder of stock image agency Fotolia.com. Now based in Singapore, 90 Seconds was launched in Auckland in 2010 by CEO Tim Norton after he struggled to find an online video production service for shoots in different places. 90 Seconds started with online production tools before launching its marketplace, which now lists 5,000 video professionals from 70 countries.\\xa0The company plans to continue adding to the mobile version of its software until clients can manage every part of the production process — from commissioning a video to reviewing footage and uploading to YouTube and social media platforms — on their tablets or smartphones.\\xa0Timeliness is important for 90 Seconds’ users, who have included Visa, Samsung and Microsoft, because they need to take advantage of trending topics and search terms. More companies are also using the platform to handle longer shoots, like TV spots.\\xa0Hooking up companies with creators and giving them all the software tools they need to produce a video is how 90 Seconds differentiates from other video production sites (which include Visually, Userfarm and SmartShoot) and also what it hopes will future-proof its business model from new competitors as demand for online videos grows.\\n\\n\\nDell\\'s SecureWorks valued at $1.42 billion in year\\'s first tech IPO:\\xa0Dell\\'s cyber security unit, SecureWorks Corp, could be valued at up to $1.42 billion in its initial public offering, the first major U.S. listing of a technology company this year. Atlanta, Georgia-based SecureWorks said on Monday its offering was expected to be priced at $15.50-$17.50 per Class A share, raising as much as $157.5 million. \\xa0The share issue market worldwide plunged to a seven-year low in the first quarter, more than halving from a year earlier to $106.6 billion, as worries over slowing economic growth kept investors wary, according to Thomson Reuters data. In the past few years, several cyber security firms such as FireEye, Rapid7 and Mimecast have gone public to take advantage of growing investor interest in them after a spate of hacking attacks on companies including major banks and retailers.\\xa0However, shares of Rapid7 and FireEye, which popped 70-80 percent in their debut, are now trading way below their IPO prices. Mimecast, which jumped 20 percent on its listing day, has also slipped below its offering price.\\xa0Ritter warned against premium pricing for stocks of cyber security firms, saying that these companies were fighting for market share, which would keep their profit growth muted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nElon Musk’s SpaceX nails landing at sea:\\xa0After several unsuccessful attempts to land an unmanned rocket on a football field-sized floating platform in the Atlantic Ocean, Elon Musk’s SpaceX finally pulled off the dramatic feat Friday afternoon in its first launch to resupply the International Space Station since its rocket exploded last year.\\xa0The landing, the first ever of a rocket’s first stage at sea, was heralded as a breakthrough for the burgeoning commercial spaceflight industry, and its leader, SpaceX. The companies’ efforts to recover their rockets is part of what Bezos calls the “Holy Grail” quest of lowering the cost of space flight, which has been so prohibitively expensive that it has long been the exclusive domain of governments.\\xa0Typically, the first stages of rockets are ditched into the ocean after firing their engines for a few minutes and boosting a second stage, or a capsule, to space.\\xa0But if the commercial sector can build innovative rockets that can be reused, many think that would dramatically reduce the costs, a key step toward making space travel more routine.\\xa0SpaceX broadcast the launch and landing live on its website, where some 80,000 viewers watched the booster descend toward the platform. The first stage was hurtling toward space when it started a bit of aerial acrobatics, turning itself around and heading back toward Earth.\\xa0As it approached the platform, the booster was tilted into the wind but was able to right itself just before touching down, about nine minutes after liftoff. Crews were expected to board the ship and secure the rocket to the platform.\\n\\n\\nBilling by Millionths of Pennies, Cloud Computing’s Giants Take In Billions:\\xa0Imagine building an enormous beach resort, maybe the best in the world. Instead of renting the rooms, you charge guests based on the grains of sand they touch. You charge very little per grain, but if they lie on enough of them, it adds up. That is one way to think about what is going on at the world’s biggest cloud-computing companies. Instead of grains of sand, think about computing cycles, the activity that goes on in a computer server that is running software. For a price, think about one line of software code for two one-millionths of a penny. When tolls that tiny are paid often enough, they can make a billion-dollar business. At Amazon Web Services, which pioneered this method late last year, there is no charge for the first million times a customer runs code. Thereafter, A.W.S. charges by the million times, or for the hundreds of milliseconds the computer is used. “The scale at which we operate allows us to do innovative things,” said Matt Wood, general manager of product strategy at A.W.S. “When we get better economies of scale, we’ll use that to our advantage.” This economics of tiny things demonstrates the global power of the few companies, including Microsoft and Google, that can make fortunes counting this small and often. In other words, you have to be really big to worry about making money off things that are really tiny.\\n\\n\\nChina\\'s $6 Billion Tech Funding Boom Signals Flight to Quality:\\xa0If the startup funding party is finally breaking up, somebody forgot to tell China.\\xa0The second-largest economy is avoiding the pitfalls affecting venture capital elsewhere, as investors around the world rein things in after an unprecedented technology financing boom. Ride-hailing app Didi Kuaidi, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s finance affiliate and online property service Homelink are close to raising at least $6 billion, people familiar with the separate deals say. The operator of Alipay, Alibaba’s affiliate, is targeting more than $3.5 billion alone, which would mark the technology industry’s largest single round of financing.\\xa0All those numbers emerged over the space of just three days last week. In China, larger startups like them are attracting major backers and garnering the lion’s share of the money even as smaller operators are left to struggle. The frenetic pace is remarkable at a time venture investment globally is plateauing: there were fewer U.S. deals in the first three months than at any time in the past four years, according to research firm PitchBook Data.\\xa0“China’s VC market is becoming very polarized,\" said Jarod Ji, an analyst at Beijing-based research firm Zero2IPO. “There’s not a lack of money in the market, but investors do feel that there’s a lack of good projects and that’s why companies like Didi are getting so much money.”\\xa0The top 20 percent of Chinese startups could get 80 percent of the funding, he added.\\n\\n\\nSAP quarterly results fall short as U.S. market slows:\\xa0Europe\\'s largest software company, SAP (SAPG.DE), warned late on Friday that first-quarter results would be weaker than expected due to slower sales of software licenses to corporate customers, particularly in Brazil and the United States.\\xa0Software license revenues fell 13 percent while the company\\'s newer, but lower-margin cloud software business grew 33 percent. Business customers are shifting to cloud-based software delivered over the Internet instead of relying on older software packages they install and run on in-house computers. \"America was a little more lumpy in terms of the signing of contracts,\" Chief Executive Bill McDermott told reporters on a conference call, noting that U.S. revenue from its classic on-premise software business grew more slowly than expected.\\xa0First-quarter operating profit, excluding special items, rose 5 percent to 1.10 billion euros ($1.25 billion). Analysts, on average, had been looking for a first-quarter operating profit, excluding special items, of 1.15 billion euros, with 12 estimates ranging from 1.09 billion to 1.25 billion euros, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data.\\xa0The company also reported revenue of 4.73 billion euros, shy of the I/B/E/S average forecast of 4.83 billion euros.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

The government added regulations related to pricing and the sourcing of sales on sites that Amazon and several rivals appear to violate. What is more, the new policy was effective immediately, giving Amazon and others no time to comply.India essentially bars companies with substantial foreign ownership from operating retail outlets that sell from their own inventories of goods. Although American multinationals like Amazon, Walmart and Apple have sought to overturn or soften those restrictions, the government has made few changes.\\xa0To work around the restrictions, Amazon and competitors billed themselves as e-commerce marketplaces, eBay-like websites that matched buyers with independent sellers. Amazon owns no inventory of its own in India, though it handles the warehousing and delivery of goods for many of its independent sellers, a model it also employs in the United States.\\xa0Last week, Indian regulators confirmed that online marketplaces, which had operated in a gray era, are legal. But they added a rule saying that no single seller can account for more than 25 percent of sales on such an e-commerce marketplace. It also limited the influence that online marketplaces can exert over the prices set by their sellers.\\xa0The new regulations appear to make Amazon’s dependence on one large seller on its site, Cloudtail, illegal, according to industry officials and analysts. While Amazon says it has more than 80,000 sellers on its India site, Cloudtail is estimated to account for 40 percent to 50 percent of the site’s sales, according to Mr. Meena of Forrester.\\xa0The parent company of Cloudtail is a partnership between Catamaran Ventures, the investment firm of the Indian business magnate, N.R. Narayana Murthy, and Amazon, which owns 49 percent. India’s leading e-commerce company, Flipkart, also works closely with an affiliated large seller and faces a similar problem.\\n\\n\\nUS Startup Funding Deals Fall to Lowest Level in Four Years - Different Story in India and China:\\xa0Venture capitalists made fewer bets in the U.S. last quarter, while putting a larger proportion of their money into the most mature private companies, according to research firm PitchBook Data. The findings show that venture investors are trying to play it safe by backing proven businesses, making it more difficult for newer startups to find capital.\\xa0Last quarter had the fewest number of venture deals in four years. Funding rounds dropped 12 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2015, when startup funding began to slow. Investments totaled $17.7 billion in the first quarter of 2016, about flat with the prior period. More than half of that went to late-stage companies. Private investors are expressing skepticism as startup valuations have skyrocketed. Mutual fund companies have written down the value of their stakes in numerous technology companies since last year. Startups are staying private longer, leaving fewer options for shareholders to cash out. No tech company went public last quarter, and many of those that did in 2015 have gotten off to a rocky start.\\xa0In other countries, there\\'s plenty of money to go around. Venture capital investments in China and India surged in the first quarter, jumping about 50 percent.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba Gives Shelter in Debt Storm as China Internet Bonds Gain:\\xa0China’s Internet giants are providing a haven for bond investors fleeing mounting default risks among the nation’s state-owned enterprises.\\xa0Investors are snapping up bonds from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., a bright spot in an economy growing at the slowest pace in a quarter-century. The rising demand also reflects a broader shift in China’s economy away from smokestack industries toward private-sector services such as e-commerce, online finance and entertainment. Creditors have grown wary of state-backed firms after Moody’s Investors Service cut its outlook on 38 of them along with the government in March.\\xa0Dollar bonds from Internet firms have returned 4.2 percent this year, the nation’s best-performing sector, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Alibaba’s securities due 2034 have gained 9 percent since Dec. 31, while 2025 notes of Baidu and Tencent both returned more than 6 percent. Alibaba, China’s biggest e-commerce company, has cashed in by raising $4 billion from loan bankers and Tencent, operator of China’s most popular messaging services, borrowed $2.45 billion in December.\\n\\n\\nMorgan Stanley Paints Bleak Outlook for Twitter on Few New Users:\\xa0Morgan Stanley analysts came down hard on Twitter Inc., lowering their forecasts for the social media company’s stock price, on projected slower growth in new users, revenue and earnings. “Engagement and new user trends remain troubling,” the analysts, led by Brian Nowak, said in a note to clients Thursday. Morgan Stanley cut its price target on Twitter to $16 from $18 and reduced its projection for 2017 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization by 13 percent to $769 million. The firm reduced its 2017 revenue forecast by 6 percent to to $3.23 billion.\\n\\n\\nMashable Fires News Staff, Replaces Executives as Part of Pivot to Video Infotainment:\\xa0Last week, the digital publication Mashable said that it had raised $15 million in a funding round led by Turner and that it would be using the money to “co-develop” content for TBS and TNT.\\xa0Today, the other shoe dropped. The company announced that it is replacing its chief content and revenue officers — Jim Roberts and Seth Rogin — and firing a large portion of its editorial staff. Additionally, Mashable is pivoting from hard news coverage; it will focus on producing lots more video about “digital culture.” According to Politico and a Mashable editor, 30 people were laid off.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter 10 Years, Amazon’s Cloud Service Is a $10 Billion Business:\\xa0Amazon’s cloud computing business is bigger after 10 years of operation than Amazon itself at the same milestone, and is on its way to being a $10 billion annual business this year, CEO Jeff Bezos wrote in a letter to shareholders today.\\xa0Amazon Web Services “is bigger than Amazon.com was at 10 years old, growing at a faster rate, and — most noteworthy in my view — the pace of innovation continues to accelerate,” Bezos wrote, adding that the unit added 722 new features in 2015, which amounted to a 40 percent increase over the prior year.\\xa0Last month AWS observed its 10th year of operations, and was the bright spot in an otherwise disappointing fourth-quarter report in January. The unit clocked $7.9 billion in revenue in 2015, amounting to more than 7 percent of Amazon’s overall sales, with an operating margin of 24 percent.\\xa0“Many characterized AWS as a bold — and unusual — bet when we started,” Bezos wrote. “We could have stuck to the knitting. I’m glad we didn’t.”\\n\\n\\nYahoo Paints Grim Financial Picture as Deadline for Bids Nears:\\xa0As Yahoo asks potential bidders to submit first-round offers for its core business next week, it is also warning them about a troubling decline in revenue and profit while obscuring the costs and cash flow of various business units.\\xa0Yahoo is projecting revenue of $4.4 billion this year, down from $5 billion last year, according to two people close to the bidding who have seen the confidential data the company has shared with potential bidders. That figure is on the low end of the revenue estimate the company shared publicly with investors in February.\\xa0Even that revenue is coming at a cost, with Yahoo expecting to pay other sites about $1 billion this year for sending traffic to its advertising services.\\xa0The company’s cash flow is also declining. Yahoo has reaffirmed to bidders its February projection that adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization would be about $750 million this year, down from $952 million in 2015. Initial bids are due at the end of next week, but that deadline might be pushed back.\\xa0Starboard Value, an activist hedge fund that is seeking to replace Yahoo’s entire board of directors at the next shareholders’ meeting this summer, has repeatedly accused the company of running a halfhearted sales process. That sentiment has been echoed by some potential bidders.\\xa0For example, Yahoo has told private equity firms and other financial players considering a bid that it considers them to be second-tier bidders, compared with so-called strategic bidders like Verizon and AT&T that would integrate Yahoo into their existing businesses.\\n\\n\\nTwitter is basically a cable company now:\\xa0Twitter is basically becoming a cable company.\\xa0The social network\\'s paid deal with the NFL to show Thursday night football games gives Twitter exclusive rights to stream the matches over the Internet. What this means for sports fans is access to another channel to watch the most popular professional sport in the country, presumably so long as they\\'re willing to see a slew of promoted tweets on Twitter\\'s website.\\xa0It\\'s akin to what the television industry has done for decades: Provide live events in hopes of growing an audience while making tons of money in advertising doing it.\\xa0Twitter isn\\'t about to stop there. It\\'s considering expanding from live sports coverage into political news and other types of video content, the company\\'s chief financial officer, Anthony Noto, told Bloomberg News.\\xa0If that happens, Twitter will have built a bundle that isn\\'t much different in style from what you get from Comcast, Verizon or many of the heavyweight TV distributors that currently dominate America\\'s entertainment ecosystem. It might be a skinnier one, but it\\'s a bundle nonetheless.\\n\\n\\nThe surprising thing that got the biggest share of online shopping dollars in 2015:\\xa0In a new report from the online metrics firm ComScore, researchers aimed to capture the ways our online shopping habits did (and did not) change in 2015, and the results contain some surprises.\\xa0ComScore analyzed which shopping categories drew the biggest online sales in 2015. Computer hardware — a category that includes personal computers and tablets — has been the leader for at least a decade. But last year, for the first time, spending on apparel and accessories took the e-commerce crown. In three of out of four quarters in 2015, apparel and accessories pulled down the most dollars. For the year, clothing generated $51.5 billion in online sales, slightly edging out $51.1 billion spent on personal computers and tablets. In some ways, this might seem logical: Tablets sales growth has slowed overall as shoppers instead opt for smartphones with bigger screens. But recall, too, that 2015 wasn’t exactly a banner year for the apparel industry: Retailers from Macy’s to Gap reported gloomy sales results as shoppers chose to spend their money on things like travel and dining out.\\xa0So the fact that online clothing sales surpassed computer hardware sales is likely telling us something bigger about customers’ online shopping patterns. For starters, it probably reflects retailers’ efforts to make it feel less risky to shop for clothes online. In other words, people are getting more used to the idea that if a pair of jeans doesn’t fit them quite as expected, or a sweater is not quite the same color blue it looked to be on a website, it can be returned with little hassle and often at no cost. Apparel also is among the categories that is seeing particular benefit from the explosive growth in shopping on smartphones. Lipsman said that many of the categories that registered particularly strong increases in online spending last year were ones in which the purchases are not “highly considered,” meaning that customers don’t spend much time researching before buying.\\xa0These purchases are especially conducive to being made on a small screen, and so with the lion’s share of online shopping growth coming from mobile devices, they are getting a particular tailwind from this change in shopping habits.\\n\\n\\nSamsung Beats Estimates as Early Debut of S7 Boosts Sales:\\xa0\\xa0Samsung Electronics Co. posted a better-than expected first-quarter profit after the early release of Galaxy S7 smartphones gave it a head-start on Apple Inc. and Chinese rivals and helped counter an industry downturn.\\xa0Operating income rose to 6.6 trillion won ($5.7 billion) in the three months ended March, the world’s largest maker of phones and memory chips said in preliminary results released Thursday. That compares with the 5.53 trillion-won average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Samsung debuted its high-end smartphones in March, about a month earlier than last year’s, with sales of the S7 line-up estimated to have hit 9 million units during their first month -- triple those of the S6 in the same time-frame. Production of curved displays for its Edge version also went more smoothly this time, avoiding the hiccups that plagued last year’s wraparound-screen line.\\xa0“The biggest reason for the sharply improved profitability is largely due to much lower marketing spending for the mobile business,” said Yoo Eui Hyung, an analyst at Dongbu Securities Co. in Seoul. “The big disparity between the earlier profit estimates and the latest revisions stems entirely from the mobile business. The faster release surely helped but it’s dubious whether the S7 can continue to surprise the market in the longer run.”\\n\\n\\nDaimler confirms HERE in talks with Amazon, Microsoft:\\xa0Amazon.com and Microsoft are in talks about taking a minority stake in HERE, a digital mapping business controlled by Germany\\'s luxury carmakers to help develop self-driving cars, Daimler said on Wednesday.\\xa0Germany\\'s luxury carmakers including Daimler\\'s Mercedes, Volkswagen\\'s (VOWG_p.DE) Audi division and BMW bought HERE for 2.5 billion euros ($2.8 billion) from Nokia last year to create an alternative digital mapping business to Google.The consortium needs cloud computing providers to manage the mass of data collected from sensors on board thousands of Mercedes, BMW and Audi cars. The data about traffic and road conditions is then fed into digital maps. \\xa0\"We need a cloud provider to handle the huge amounts of data created by HERE and its users. We haven’t taken any decisions yet,\" Weber told the Wall Street Journal.\\xa0Intelligent mapping systems supply information to control self-driving cars, which are equipped with street-scanning sensors to measure traffic and road conditions. This location data can in turn be shared with other map users.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nYik Yak’s CTO drops out as the hyped anonymous app stagnates:\\xa0Is Yik Yak a thing anymore? Not so much, according to download stats, traffic charts, surveys and a source that says the college app’s monthly user count has been declining. That source — with intimate knowledge of the company — also tipped me off that Yik Yak‘s original CTOTom Chernetsky has bailed, which the startup now confirms. He’s not the only one who thinks the supposed rocket ship won’t fly as high as some expected when Sequoia led a mammoth $62 million at $400 million valuation in November 2014. Since late last year, Yik Yak’s VP of Product, Director of Engineering, Lead Product Designer and other senior employees have departed. Months after Sequoia pumped a ton of cash into the Atlanta startup, download rates and traffic began to drop, according to App Annie and comScore charts dug up by GigaOm. Things have gotten worse since, as Google Play dropped it from its charts last March, likely due to hate speech in the app. These stats all mesh with what my source says, which is that Yik Yak has had zero significant growth in over a year, and consistently misses its growth targets. They cite 4 million monthly active users as the count in January, noting the number has declined since then, though I can’t confirm that exact number. The problem with anonymous apps is that over time they start to feel exhausting. The crude stories, played-out jokes stolen from Reddit and cringe-worthy bullying wear on people. While they might have a few juicy quips of their own to share, blowing off steam can eventually feel pointless. That’s why my Secret and Yik Yak usage dried up. Yik Yak’s product has continued to plod along, despite some colleges’ attempts to ban the app for facilitating cyberbullying. But nothing has made it feel fresh again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhatsApp completes end-to-end encryption rollout:\\xa0It’s a security project that’s taken around a year and a half to complete, but messaging giant WhatsApp has now fully implemented strong end-to-end encryption on its platform and across all mobile platforms for which it offers apps.\\xa0This means users of the latest versions of the messaging app will have their comms and media end-to-end encrypted by default. And there are a lot of WhatsApp users; earlier this year the Facebook owned company announced it had passed a billion active users.\\xa0Securing cross-platform video comms was the last piece of the puzzle, according to a WhatsApp spokesman.\\xa0End-to-end encryption means the content of communications are not stored in plaintext on WhatsApp’s servers. Nor is the company able to decrypt users’ messages to access them since it does not hold the encryption keys. So WhatsApp will be unable to be compelled to hand over messaging data — even if served with a warrant by authorities demanding access.\\n\\n\\nVirtual Reality Check: Rating the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift:\\xa0JUST a week after Facebook released the Oculus Rift, the first high-powered virtual reality device for consumers, a less publicized contender has arrived: the HTC Vive.\\xa0Similar to the Rift, the Vive — a joint development by the Taiwanese manufacturer HTC and the video game distribution company Valve — is a virtual reality headset that connects to a powerful computer.\\xa0The Vive is even more expensive than the Rift — it costs $799 for the headset and $1,000 to $2,000 for a compatible computer. Facebook’sOculus sells the Rift headset for $599, or $1,500 when the system is bundled with a computer.\\xa0The main advantage of the HTC Vive headset is that it comes with motion controllers, which let you effectively reach out and grab objects in virtual reality. This kind of interaction feels much more natural for virtual reality than the game controller included with the Rift.\\xa0Also, the Vive’s motion-sensing base stations capture richer movements, enabling people to walk around in a larger space or crouch and grab something while using virtual reality; the Rift’s camera can detect movements, too, but the Rift was primarily designed to be used while standing or sitting.\\xa0Another benefit of the Vive is that the headset fits better. With the Rift, I could always see a small gap in the space beneath the nose. The Vive headset completely blocks the outside world. HTC also includes a piece of foam that can be inserted into the Vive for a better fit for a narrower face.\\xa0But a major downside of the Vive is the setup, which is more demanding than the Rift’s. HTC recommends that you drill mounts into the ceiling to install the motion-sensing base stations to ensure that the sensors have a clear line of sight with the headset and your body. In other words, to take full advantage of the Vive, you probably need to dedicate a room to virtual reality; to use the Rift, you can get away with clearing out a bit of standing space.\\xa0The other obvious downside of the Vive is the higher cost. With a computer and accessories included in the total price, the Vive will cost roughly $300 more than the Rift. Then again, if you are willing to spend more than $1,000 for virtual reality, that extra $300 might not matter much. This is Year 1 of powerful and capable virtual reality systems coming to the mainstream. Over time, the content that will become available for these devices will define their worth. There isn’t much to do with either system yet, and consumers would be wise to wait to see if any killer virtual reality apps or games emerge for the systems.\\n\\n\\nAfter a Pause, Nutanix Signals IPO Plans Are Back on Track:\\xa0Nutanix, a supplier of storage products for data centers, just updated its paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, signaling that its plans for an initial public offering may no longer be on hold.\\xa0The new filing shows that Nutanix, based in San Jose, Calif., nearly doubled its revenue in the six-month period ended Jan. 31, to $190 million from $102 million in the year-ago period. It ran a net loss of nearly $72 million, which increased from $56 million a year ago. Operating expenses rose to $190 million from $112 million previously.\\xa0The company first filed for an IPO in December, but was reported to have put those plans on hold in February after markets turned south. After the Dell-owned security company SecureWorks, which is expected to offer about 20 percent of its shares in an IPO later this month, Nutanix would appear to be on track to be the second tech IPO of 2016.\\n\\n\\nAmazon Acquires Image Analysis Startup Orbeus:\\xa0The acquisition took place in the fall of 2015, said the person who asked not to be identified because Amazon hasn’t announced the deal.\\xa0Orbeus developed photo-recognition technology based on a powerful type of AI called neural networks and made this available as a consumer application, as well as a service for other companies and developers called ReKognition. It automatically categorized and identified the contents of photos. Orbeus’s app, PhotoTime, came out before Google launched its successful AI-based Photos app.\\xa0\"ReKognition API is no longer taking new customers,\" Orbeus says on its website. \"But we’re up to new/exciting things.\" Other startups applying neural networks to image-recognition and related computer-vision tasks include New York-based Clarifai Inc. and Palo Alto-based MetaMind.\\xa0Big technology companies are interested in this field, and other areas of AI. Salesforce.com Inc. said Monday it acquired MetaMind, while Apple Inc. said in January it purchased Emotient Inc., which specialized in facial-recognition technology.\\n\\n\\nMedium Chases Revenue With Promoted Stories; Adds Subscriptions:\\xa0Medium, the 4-year-old online publishing platform from Twitter Inc. co-founder Ev Williams, now has a plan to pay the bills.\\xa0The company will make money in much the same way Twitter and Facebook Inc. do -- by allowing brands to post stories and pay for them to be promoted to a wider audience through prominent placement in the news feed. Alphabet Inc.’s Nest and Intel Corp. are among the first advertisers taking this approach to reach Medium’s 25 million unique readers.\\xa0The blogging site also plans to extend its tools for media publishers, so they can host their entire website within Medium, helping the companies save money on technology costs. The Awl and Pacific Standard are among new publications coming to Medium starting Tuesday. Publishers can also choose to put some stories behind a members-only paywall.\\xa0On Medium, people can publish and annotate long-form articles and follow networks of authors. The company, backed by investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock Partners and Google Ventures, last raised $57 million in September at a $400 million valuation, according to a person familiar with the matter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter Built a New Button So You’ll Send More Private Messages:\\xa0\\xa0Reply. Retweet. Like. And now Send.\\xa0Twitter is adding a new button to the bottom of each tweet so that it’s simpler to send that tweet to another user within a private message. The new icon, a small envelope right next to the heart-shaped Like button, automatically attaches the tweet to a private message which you can then address to another user. \\xa0But the fact that Twitter is putting a new button onto each tweet is a pretty good indication of how important direct messaging is to the company. Twitter was late to building out its messaging service and as a result has always lagged behind other messaging apps like Facebook’s Messenger or Snapchat.\\xa0But Twitter DMs are increasing in popularity — Twitter claims that 60 percent more messages were sent in 2015 than 2014. Adding a new button to encourage more private messages should bump that number even higher.\\xa0It should also make it easier for users to send tweets to brands or retailers, a customer service use case Twitter is starting to build features for. It’s one of the reasons the company removed the 140-character text limit for direct messages last summer; it’s hard to have a conversation with a customer service agent when you can’t send more then two sentences at a time. The customer service use case was also one of the reasons Twitter has considered spinning DMs into its own app. It ultimately decided against the idea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon Plans Big Push to Expand Prime Now Fast Delivery:\\xa0Amazon.com Inc. plans to broaden the reach of its fast delivery service Prime Now, and is selling major brands promotional deals connected to the expansion, a sign the world’s largest Internet retailer is satisfied with early results from the nascent offering.\\xa0The service -- now only available through the Prime Now app on smartphones -- will be run on Amazon’s website starting in May, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg.\\xa0Getting Prime Now on the Web puts the service in front of a larger audience, many of whom may not have downloaded the app on their phones. While shopping on mobile devices is expected to reach $96.2 billion in the U.S. this year, that represents a quarter of all e-commerce, according to the research firm EMarketer.\\xa0Amazon is trying to sell advertising space to major brands for the Web launch, promising them visibility with tens of millions of Amazon shoppers. The premium \"Launch Hero Package\" would cost $500,000 for about two weeks of placement on Amazon’s website associated with the rollout. That price includes e-mail promotions sent to Amazon customers, which Amazon said have a stand-alone value of $100,000, according to the documents reviewed by Bloomberg.\\n\\n\\nSalesforce.com Acquires Deep Learning Startup MetaMind:\\xa0Cloud business software company Salesforce.com has acquired MetaMind, a startup focused on artificial learning that had been funded by Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and venture capital firm Khosla Ventures.\\xa0Terms were not disclosed, but it has all the markings of an “acqhire” sort of deal. Founder and CTO Richard Socher announced the deal in a post on the MetaMind website. Socher says on his personal website that his new title is Chief Scientist at Salesforce.\\xa0MetaMind’s area of expertise is deep learning, the subset of artificial intelligence focused on data processing that is en vogue with Google, Facebook and other tech companies. The startup’s specialty is natural language processing — allowing computers to analyze relationships between words. Some of its capabilities disclosed in published researchdescribe advancements in the field that outrank those of some of the larger tech giants.\\xa0Socher, a Stanford PhD, has said MetaMind’s plan was to sell this technology as a service to other companies. At MetaMind, he led a tiny group of researchers who gained a reputation for some rapid breakthroughs in the area of artificial intelligence. A Re/codereport from 2014 described how after only four months, the team came in only slightly behind Google in the ImageNet competition, in which companies compete to build systems that can recognize images.\\n\\n\\nToyota expands Microsoft partnership in connected vehicle services:\\xa0Toyota Motor Corp is expanding a five-year-old partnership with Microsoft Corp to develop new internet-connected vehicle services for owners and dealers, Toyota said on Monday.\\xa0The automaker has established Toyota Connected at its U.S. headquarters in Plano, Texas, to consolidate its existing connectivity services and serve as the company\\'s \"data science\" hub. Microsoft has a 5 percent stake in the venture.\\xa0Among the services to be developed or expanded under Toyota Connected are insurance coverage and rates based on owners\\' actual driving patterns; connected vehicle networks that can share information on traffic and weather conditions, such as icy roads; and information services tailored to a driver\\'s habits and preferences, including monitoring heart rate, glucose level and other personal health data.\\xa0The new wireless services will use Microsoft\\'s cloud-based Azure platform. Toyota launched its initial partnership with Microsoft in 2011. Ford Motor Co introduced a similar program with Microsoft a year ago, and BMW AG and Nissan Motor Co announced Azure-based services earlier this year.\\xa0Toyota Connected will use Microsoft\\'s cloud technology to develop \"predictive, contextual and intuitive services\" to \"humanize the driving experience while pushing the technology into the background,\" Toyota said.\\xa0Toyota Connected also will consolidate the automaker\\'s current initiatives in data analytics, data management and data services for dealers and fleet customers.\\xa0In addition, the new organization will provide support for Toyota\\'s ongoing research in robotics and artificial intelligence, as well as development of self-driving cars.\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft’s mobile problem may not be a problem at all:\\xa0When Microsoft announced its Windows 10 strategy last year, the thinking was that the unified platform would drive Windows Mobile and finally bring the Windows phone out of the doldrums where it’s been virtually forever.\\xa0The idea was you could develop once for Windows 10 desktop and easily share that code on any device, making it impossibly attractive for developers, which would finally drive Windows Mobile popularity in a beautiful virtuous development cycle.\\xa0Unfortunately, it hasn’t worked out that way, and Microsoft finds itself in an unusual position, developing software for iOS and Android because it simply doesn’t have a viable Windows mobile ecosystem.\\xa0The question remains; can Microsoft succeed without a strong Windows mobile position? From the looks of things, they don’t seem to have much choice. Nadella appears to be staking his position in the cloud, which is a perfectly reasonable way to play it, while opening up his company’s tools to iOS and Android in the absence of any meaningful Windows phone adoption. When you look at the beauty of the mobile-cloud connection, it’s understandable Microsoft would want to be there with Windows, but perhaps Nadella is beginning to understand that Windows is not necessarily the future of the company — Azure and Office 365 are — and that could explain why the company stayed firmly focused on these two areas at Build.\\xa0When you combine that with the idea of bots created by Microsoft, including Cortana (Microsoft’s talking virtual assistant), that can run in Microsoft’s tools or external platforms like Slack and LINE, you start to see a vision where Microsoft thrives even without an in-house mobile platform.\\xa0As the world moves swiftly to that mobile-cloud intersection, perhaps the underlying OS becomes less important. If that’s the case — if Microsoft can have a piece of the underlying cloud-mobile plumbing and have apps and bots created in its ecosystem, run anywhere on any device — it renders the Windows phone gap irrelevant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTesla says Model 3 orders top $10 billion in first 36 hours:\\xa0Tesla Motors said orders for its new Model 3 electric sedan topped 253,000 in the first 36 hours -- a fast start for the company\\'s first mass-market vehicle, which may not begin to reach customers for another 18 months or more.\\xa0Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted on Friday that the Model 3, which is slated to go into production in late 2017, will sell at an average price of $42,000, including the price of options and additional features, which would give the initial flurry of orders an estimated retail value of $10.6 billion.\\xa0That intense interest, fanned in part by a steady stream of tweets by Musk, could help boost Tesla\\'s stock price, which closed Friday at $237.59, up 3.4 percent. The stock has soared more than 60 percent since hitting a 12-month low in February.\\xa0The car\\'s average selling price projected by Musk is well above the $35,000 base price. Analysts earlier had estimated the first Model 3s off the factory line in Fremont, California, could be loaded with extra equipment and sell for $50,000 to$60,000.\\xa0Tesla has undertaken a costly expansion of the Fremont plant, aiming to boost annual capacity to 500,000 by 2020, with production of the Model 3, the company\\'s first mass-market car, ramping up slowly through 2019.\\xa0Some analysts said the company could have trouble filling all the initial Model 3 orders, which are accompanied by a refundable $1,000 deposit, until 2020.\\xa0Barclays analyst Brian Johnson on Friday said the heavy influx of Model 3 orders \"sets the stage for an equity offering\" later this year by Tesla, much of which would go toward factory construction and product development.\\n\\n\\nChina’s Companies Poised to Take Leap in Developing a Driverless Car:\\xa0some argue that conditions in China are actually more favorable for quick adoption of driverless cars, in part because of more aggressive support from the national and local governments. And, unlike in the United States, China never fully developed a romance with the open road and car ownership.\\xa0Car ownership has spiked in China, of course. And in recent years, it has become a middle-class status symbol to own a car. For the ultrawealthy, there are clubs dedicated to Ferraris and Maseratis.\\xa0But enormous traffic jams in China’s largest cities can make driving a less-than-romantic experience. Why not let a machine built with artificial intelligence inside do the work for you? “It’s not that people are more willing to use the cars in Beijing or Shanghai, it’s that the economic value is much higher in China than in the U.S.,” Mr. Mosquet said, adding that air pollution could be as much a catalyst as bad traffic.\\xa0Even as American companies like Google and Tesla work on autonomous vehicles, a number of Chinese companies are working on driverless car technology. The Internet company Leshi Internet Information & Technology (better known as Letv) has a driverless car tech unit, and the Chinese carmaker Great Wall Motors has opened a research center in Silicon Valley. The assumed leader in the field in China is the search engine company Baidu, which has been at work on autonomous vehicles since 2013.\\n\\n\\nJeff Bezos just live-tweeted his space company’s latest rocket launch:\\xa0Opening the doors to his space company to the media for the first time last month, Jeff Bezos said he had kept the company so quiet and secretive for a simple reason: “We’ll talk about Blue Origin when we have something to talk about.”\\xa0Now Bezos is talking — and tweeting.\\xa0The billionaire founder of Amazon.com (and owner of The Washington Post) not only announced ahead of time that his space company would launch a rocket on Saturday, but he live-tweeted it, giving his followers a play-by-play of the event, and a few inside glimpses.\\xa0Saturday’s liftoff from Blue Origin’s launch site in West Texas was the third consecutive time the company has launched and landed its reusable New Shepard suborbital vehicle, which consists of a rocket and a capsule designed to take astronauts just past the edge of space. While the company has yet to fly any humans — Bezos said that test flights with humans are probably a year away — it has now demonstrated that its rocket can fly repeatedly. Bezos, and others, believe that is a key step toward lowering the cost of spaceflight, and therefore making it more accessible. Typically the first stages of rockets are discarded after each use. But Bezos and SpaceX’s Elon Musk are developing technologies to land the first stages vertically, using the engine thrust to slow them down. The United Launch Alliance is also working to recover the engines of its new rocket. But in his live-tweeting Saturday, Bezos not only chronicled the launch and landing, but also showed how the company paints a turtle on the capsule to commemorate each successful launch. He even tweeted a picture of a pair of new cowboy boots with the company’s motto printed on them.\\xa0That motto is “Gradatim Ferociter,” loosely translated to “Step by Step, Ferociously,” which captures the ethos of the company to move methodically toward its goals. That’s also why it uses the symbol of a tortoise, which moved slowly but still crossed the finish line ahead of the hare.\\n\\n\\nApple\\'s Push to Flood India With Used iPhones Ignites Backlash:\\xa0Apple Inc.’s latest attempt to crack the Indian smartphone market -- by selling used phones -- is meeting a wall of resistance.\\xa0The iPhone maker is seeking permission to become the first company allowed to import and sell used phones into the country, its second attempt in as many years. This time, the stakes are higher and a growing number of industry executives are fighting the move, warning government officials in private that it’ll open the floodgates to electronic waste, jeopardize local players, and make a farce of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Make in India program to encourage local manufacturing.\\xa0“Make in India could turn into Dump in India,” said Sudhir Hasija, chairman of Karbonn Mobiles, who said it sells about 1.7 million phones a month.\\xa0Apple’s application in 2015 was rejected by the environment ministry without much fanfare. But things have changed since: India, as the world’s second largest mobile population, now represents a vast untapped opportunity for Apple just as China and the U.S. are slowing. Apple has publicly talked up its prospects in India and is on course to get the green light to open its first retail stores. Apple now has less than 2 percent of an Indian market in which four-fifths of phones cost less than $150. Branded smartphones are available for as little as $35 in India. Western multinationals from car-makers to soda vendors use “India only” prices and cut-rate “India edition” products to woo customers. Apple can’t employ those strategies without tarnishing its marquee phone’s premium aura.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere\\'s the lane? Self-driving cars confused by shabby U.S. roadways, Volvo CEO is not amused:\\xa0Volvo\\'s North American CEO, Lex Kerssemakers, lost his cool as the automaker\\'s semi-autonomous prototype sporadically refused to drive itself during a press event at the Los Angeles Auto Show. \"It can\\'t find the lane markings!\" Kerssemakers griped to Mayor Eric Garcetti, who was at the wheel. \"You need to paint the bloody roads here!\" Shoddy infrastructure has become a roadblock to the development of self-driving cars, vexing engineers and adding time and cost. Poor markings and uneven signage on the 3 million miles of paved roads in the United States are forcing automakers to develop more sophisticated sensors and maps to compensate, industry executives say. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently called the mundane issue of faded lane markings \"crazy,\" complaining they confused his semi-autonomous cars. In other developed countries, greater standardization of road signs and markings makes it easier for robot cars to navigate. In the U.S., however, traffic lights can be aligned vertically, horizontally or \"dog-house\" style in two columns. Pavement markings use paint with different degrees of reflectivity - or don\\'t exist at all.\\xa0\"If the lane fades, all hell breaks loose,\" said Christoph Mertz, a research scientist at Carnegie Mellon University. \"But cars have to handle these weird circumstances and have three different ways of doing things in case one fails.\" To make up for roadway aberrations, carmakers and their suppliers are incorporating multiple sensors, maps and data into their cars, all of which adds cost.\\xa0Mercedes says the \"drive pilot\" system found in its recently unveiled luxury E Class 2017 sedans works even with no lane markings. The system - which incorporates 23 sensors - takes into account guard rails, barriers, and other cars to keep cars in their lanes up to 84 miles (135km) per hour, under \"suitable circumstances.\"\\xa0Boston Consulting Group estimates that initial semi-autonomous features add $4,000 to a car\\'s price.\\n\\n\\nFacebook’s Live Video Effort Entices Media Companies:\\xa0When severe weather passed through the Atlanta area early this month, Brad Nitz, a meteorologist for a local television station, WSB-TV, fed viewers live video updates on the station’s website, as he has done for years.\\xa0But then he did something new: He turned away from the television camera and addressed an iPhone that was streaming him live — on Facebook. And the station’s social media manager, Jonathan Anker, watched this new Facebook audience swell.\\xa0At its peak, the stream reached 8,800 viewers at once, and the segment has been played more than 77,000 times in total, far more than the station’s typical online audience.\\xa0The numbers, Mr. Anker said, were “seriously out of whack, in a delightful way.”\\xa0Experiences like this have media companies swooning over the possibilities of posting live video to Facebook, a feature made widely available two months ago. For years, companies have searched for ways to unlock three tough questions: How do you attract people to live online videos? How do you reach people on their mobile devices? And how do you get more out of Facebook’s 1.6 billion users? Now, they hope, they have found a key for all three. Yet it is also raising some questions inside the companies about if — and when — they will see any meaningful money come from the push. The feature, called Facebook Live, has largely lived under the radar so far. But it is one of the company’s highest-priority projects, according to three people directly involved with the initiative, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\\xa0Internally, Facebook Live is seen as a way to move beyond hosting conversations about television and live events to becoming a venue for both. Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, has made Facebook Live one of his pet projects, two of the people said, devoting significant resources and effort to the initiative. Facebook plans to announce a suite of new features and partners in early April and at F8, Facebook’s developer conference in San Francisco later in the month. Facebook, though, has prioritized getting live video in front of as many users as possible. The company has been eager to talk with media companies about getting started with streaming, but remains vague in conversations about revenue sharing or subscription models.\\xa0It is pushing a build-first, make-money-later philosophy, one that can be frustrating to media partners, particularly those struggling to navigate broader changes in the online media industry. But whatever the frustrations, they are outweighed by the prospect of reaching Facebook’s huge audience.\\n\\n\\nLinkedIn Buddies Up Closer to Lynda.com, Adds Course Recommendations Based on Your Career:\\xa0LinkedIn is finding more ways to pair its professional network with Lynda.com, the online video library it bought for $1.5 billion last April. The most recent integration: LinkedIn is using data around which jobs are most popular among its users to suggest collections of videos that can help train someone interested in that career. If you were interested in becoming a Web designer, for example, Lynda.com could now recommend a collection of classes to help you learn the skills necessary for that job. Some extra revenue would be great news for the company, and would also help justify the $1.5 billion it paid for the video library last year. It’s one of the reasons LinkedIn is also putting Lynda.com courses on Virgin America flights. LinkedIn stock has fallen by nearly 50 percent since the start of the year, and just this week Barclay’s analyst Paul Vogel downgraded the stock over fear of slowing revenue growth. It’s unclear whether a “shopping list” of videos will actually open any wallets, but it certainly can’t hurt.\\n\\n\\nGovernment report details Theranos quality control issues:\\xa0A government report released late Thursday accuses Theranos of producing inaccurate test results, of failing to meet its own lab standards and hiring unqualified personnel.\\xa0The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service visited Theranos’ main facilities in Newark, California last November and found the one drop blood test startup’s machines produced wildly inaccurate test results – including one for cancer detection, according to a redacted version of the report put out by the Wall Street Journal.\\xa0The newly released 121-page report, obtained in full by the WSJ details quality control issues – including the failure to meet Theranos own standards.\\xa0According to the report, erratic test results were frequent when tested in July 2014, and from February to June of 2015 on Theranos’ proprietary blood test machine Edison. One example – a test to measure a hormone affecting testosterone levels failed 87 percent of the time when run on Edison. It is unfathomable Theranos would be allowed to run test results for the public during this time. and these new details provide an inside look at some very real issues surrounding Theranos as a company, particularly around its code-named Edison technology – the supporting reason for the company’s $9 billion valuation.\\n\\n\\nAmazon Expands Buttons for Reordering Essentials -- Like Doritos:\\xa0Amazon.com Inc. is expanding the number of products available for instant re-ordering through its wireless Dash Buttons, citing high customer demand.\\xa0After last year rolling out the WiFi-connected plastic tabs that can be mounted to the fridge, washing machine or kitchen cupboard, the online retailing giant is increasing the number of brands that can be re-ordered by pushing a button to more than 100, Amazon said in a statement Thursday.\\xa0Now Amazon Prime customers who suddenly find themselves low on supplies -- from Trojan condoms to Doritos chips, Energizer batteries, Purina dog food and more -- can hit the button to reorder the product and get it delivered for free. The buttons cost $4.99 each, with the cost reimbursed after the first order through Dash.\\xa0When the buttons were first introduced in March 2015 they were met with some skepticism as to whether people would want or use them. But Amazon said orders placed through Dash have grown by more than 75 percent in the last three months alone and now take place more than once a minute.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nInside the Little-Known Japan Firm Helping the FBI Crack iPhones:\\xa0The little-known Japanese company at the center of a legal tussle between Apple Inc. and the U.S. government over the hacking of an iPhone built its business on pinball game machines and stumbled into the mobile phone security business almost by accident.\\xa0Cellebrite Mobile Synchronization Ltd. worked with the FBI to crack an iPhone connected in a terrorist attack, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified as the matter is private. Neither Cellebrite nor the FBI have confirmed the link, and a spokesman from parent Sun Corp. on Thursday said the company isn’t able to comment on specific criminal cases. Sun, based in a small town of 100,000 southwest of Tokyo, has been building pinball-like game machines found in Japan’s pachinko parlors since the 1970s but has often displayed bigger tech ambitions. The Konan, Aichi-based company developed personal computers in the late 1970s, computer games and more recently, iPhone mahjong apps. In 2007, as sales slumped, Sun acquired Petah Tikva, Israel-based Cellebrite.\\xa0Cellebrite hadn’t ventured into forensics at the time, and the purchase was mainly to add phone-to-phone data transfer to Sun’s fledgling telecommunications business, said the Japanese company’s spokesman Hidefumi Sugaya. When Cellebrite later took on investigative agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation as clients, the business took off, he said in a telephone interview. Today, the bulk of Sun’s mobile data solutions business comes from Cellebrite, said Sugaya. \"Although the FBI didn’t get a legal decision that would require Apple to hack around its own security software, it created a situation where they can go to third parties to do that,\" said Matt Larson, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \"Companies like Cellebrite may have found a niche industry of assisting the FBI unlock personal devices in select cases moving forward.\"\\xa0Cellebrite sells hardware and software for extracting data from hand-held devices, even if it has been encrypted or deleted. It employs more than 500 people and has offices in Israel, the U.S., Brazil, Germany, Singapore and the U.K., according to its website.Founded in 1999, Cellebrite was bought by Sun Corp. for a reported $17.5 million.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHuawei 2015 revenue jumps 37 percent, strongest in seven years:\\xa0China\\'s Huawei on Friday posted its strongest revenue growth since 2008 as China\\'s adoption of fourth-generation (4G) mobile technology and strong smartphone sales worldwide boosted sales for one of the world\\'s largest telecom equipment makers.\\xa0The Shenzhen-based company said global revenue rose 37 percent to 395 billion yuan ($61.10 billion) in 2015, slightly above its forecast of 390 billion yuan.\\xa0Net profit rose 32 percent to 36.9 billion yuan, from 27.9 billion yuan a year earlier, while operating margins dipped to 11.6 percent from 11.9 percent.Revenue in Huawei\\'s carrier business, which competes with Sweden\\'s Ericsson for the top spot globally for telecommunication equipment, increased 21.4 percent in 2015 on strong demand for 4G telecommunication equipment.\\xa0In Huawei\\'s enterprise division, which builds private networks for companies and organizations, revenue rose 43.8 percent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith $340 million in revenue, Nest is underperforming, and its future at Google is at risk:\\xa0\\xa0Nest generated about $340 million in sales last year, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. That’s an impressive figure for a company in the very nascent market of Internet-connected devices. Nest currently sells three products: The flagship smart thermostat; Protect, its smoke detector; and Nest Cam, the home-monitoring video predecessor to Dropcam.\\xa0But it’s below the initial expectations Google had set for Nest when it bought the startup in 2014 for a whopping $3.2 billion. The company’s sales performance may face even deeper scrutiny inside Google’s new parent company, Alphabet, where Nest now sits, as the hardware maker faces its most critical year ever. Alphabet, whose execs have spoken regularly about controlling costs at the non-Google companies, may become less charitable. And in the meanwhile,\\xa0Nest\\'s CEO got slammed in a column in TechCrunch\\xa0for the culture there:\\xa0though the company currently manufactures three products — its thermostat, a smoke alarm, and its Nest cam (via its Dropcam acquisition) — it has repeatedly delayed product releases and disappointed its customers, particularly given the billing that Nest’s products receive.\\xa0In one of the more visible cases of customer dissatisfaction, a New York Times reporter said in January that a software bug drained his Nest thermostat’s battery, a discovery he made only when his infant began crying from his chilly bedroom in the middle of the night. Nest’s smart smoke alarm has also been plagued by software glitches.\\xa0In the meantime, says The Information, Google has moved forward on similar efforts, including its OnHub wireless router and a stealth project to create a competitor to Amazon’s Echo.\\xa0That Google has done so without Nest’s involvement must be demoralizing to Nest’s current employees, who were presumably drawn to the challenge of helping Nest become one of the world’s great hardware companies.\\xa0But there’s reason for even more concern going forward: Fadell has created a culture that’s increasingly unlikely to attract the world’s best engineers, which has always been the top priority for its parent company. (Google, in stark contrast, is consistently ranked as one of thebest places to work.)\\xa0If Alphabet wants to maintain its feel-good reputation, it may be time to part ways with Fadell, or at least to demote him. He’s now had more than two years to prove himself.\\xa0What Fadell has shown instead is that he’s unable to get out of his own way — or Nest’s.\\n\\n\\nCar-Pooling Helps Uber Go the Extra Mile:\\xa0One day not long ago, an Uber driver picked up a passenger in San Francisco’s gritty Tenderloin district. Let’s call our passenger Abby, because her real name has been lost to database anonymization, an effort to keep her identity private.\\xa0Abby needed to go to Noe Valley, a 25-minute drive that might ordinarily have cost about $15. But she had chosen UberPool, the ride-hailing company’s 18-month-old car-pooling program. In the process she had unwittingly initiated one of the service’s more epic recent trips.\\xa0Unlike a standard Uber ride, in which a single rider starts a one-time trip, UberPool works like a party line for cars. Travis Kalanick, Uber’s co-founder and chief executive, describes it as the future of his company — and thus the future of transportation in America.\\xa0Call up the app, specify your destination, and in exchange for a significant discount, UberPool matches you with other riders going the same way. The service might create a ride just for you, but just as often, it puts you in a ride that began long ago — one that has spanned several drop-offs and pickups, a kind of instant bus line created from collective urban demand.\\xa0In total, Uber collected about $48 for the ride, of which the driver kept $35. The company had collapsed five separate rides into a single trip, saving about six miles of travel and removing several cars from the road. For riders, the discounts amounted to savings of at least half of a standard Uber trip. For the driver, an hourlong trip with no idle time resulted in steady earnings (Uber drivers make money only when riders are in the car). And though Uber made less from the single ride than it would have from multiple rides, the company benefited by installing itself as a fixture in people’s lives. UberPool may push us to re-evaluate how we think about Uber and its impact on the world.\\n\\n\\nPeople Are Spending Lots of Time, Not Money, on Their Phones:\\xa0Shopping on mobile phones is growing at its fastest rate ever. But there’s still a huge gap between how much time shoppers spend on mobile websites and apps, and the percentage of total e-commerce sales that happen on these mobile sites. One big reason for this 44 percent gap: Entering in credit card and shipping details on a phone can be a pain, both on mobile websites and in apps.\\xa0Services like Apple Pay and Android Pay have eliminated a lot of that work in partnering apps, by filling in those details automatically. And as Re/code reported, Apple Pay will be coming to mobile websites soon, too.\\xa0If the gap between time spent and dollars spent on mobile sites is going to close, these services are going to be a big reason why.\\n\\n\\nElon Musk has a lot riding on his new Tesla:\\xa0Tesla chief executive Elon Musk is poised to reveal his newest creation, the Model 3, at an event on Thursday. Starting at $35,000, the car represents Tesla\\'s first electric vehicle aimed at price-conscious, mainstream consumers. And how it fares is going to have a major impact on Tesla\\'s long-term future as a company — and the future of electric cars more broadly. That\\'s why this unveiling is an incredibly important moment. Back in 2006, Musk laid out this vision in a blog post on Tesla\\'s website: The strategy of Tesla is to enter at the high end of the market, where customers are prepared to pay a premium, and then drive down market as fast as possible to higher unit volume and lower prices with each successive model. In other words, this is the endgame. Although the company had focused first on high-end cars — the Tesla Roadster, the Model S, and the Model X — the ultimate goal was to bring the electric car to the masses. So for Tesla to have reached this point is going to be, naturally, a very big deal in the company\\'s history. But that\\'s not the only reason the Model 3 is significant. Tesla\\'s new car is important in a very immediate sense because it offers Tesla a big chance at reversing some of the headwinds facing the company. You may recall that in October, Consumer Reports dinged the Model S for reliability problems, even though the same publication had otherwise issued aglowing review of the vehicle. Meanwhile, Tesla sales may have been affected by low oil prices that could be suppressing demand for electric vehicles, even as internal production issues hindered the company\\'s supply. Not all of that is Tesla\\'s fault, but it has prompted analysts to sour on Tesla\\'s stock. Over the latter half of 2015, shares of Tesla fell roughly 15 percent from about $280 a share to $240. (It\\'s now hovering at $230.) The Model 3 could be Tesla\\'s opportunity to regain momentum.\\n\\n\\nAmazon Assembly, Installation Services Bolster Big-Product Sales:\\xa0Amazon.com Inc. wants to sell bigger things. To do so, the Web retailer has put together an army of workers who can handle everything from mounting flat TVs on walls to assembling treadmills. In the year since it rolled out Amazon Home Services, which also offers professional jobs such as painting, plumbing and yoga instruction, the online store has expanded the service to 30 cities from an initial four. Amazon now offers more than 1,200 services, the Seattle-based company said on Wednesday. It’s part of a push by Amazon to expand beyond products, and also a way to make it easier for consumers to buy big items that require an extra pair of hands to set up. Amazon has also increased its warehouse capacity for large items like furniture and flat-screen televisions. A new shipping hub in Kansas announced last week will be among about a dozen Amazon warehouses specifically designed for big products. Others are in Connecticut and California. Amazon now sells more than 1 million items that give shoppers the option of requesting assembly, installation or other related services, which is boosting the sale of home-improvement products, said Erika Takeuchi, a spokeswoman for Amazon. The most popular services requested are mounting flat-screen televisions to walls and assembling treadmills, she said. Amazon’s home services also include a wide range of offerings that don’t require purchases from the online store. Housecleaning is the third most popular job requested, according to Amazon. Other services include landscaping, gutter cleaning, pet grooming and yoga instruction. But most service requests are tied to a purchase.\\n\\n\\nFoxconn unit Hon Hai\\'s Quarterly Profit Slides as Smartphone Demand Wilts:\\xa0Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.’s quarterly profit dropped for the first time in more than three years after the main assembler of Apple’s devices fell prey to slowing iPhone sales and intensifying competition in contract manufacturing.\\xa0The largest member of billionaire Terry Gou’s Foxconn Technology Group reported a 7 percent slide in fourth-quarter net income to NT$52.9 billion ($1.6 billion), compared with the NT$59.1 billion average of analysts’ estimates. The fall in profit was Hon Hai’s first since the second quarter of 2012 on a comparable basis, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\\xa0Hon Hai’s 2015 profit exceeded expectations but it’s grappling with a slowdown in smartphone demand. The Taiwanese company gets half its revenue from Apple, whichwarned in January of its first quarterly sales decline in over a decade as China decelerates. The iPhone maker has since launched a smaller and cheaper version of its marquee device, which investors are counting on to rejuvenate the business.\\xa0Gou is seeking to broaden Foxconn’s remit, transforming the contract manufacturer into a company that also makes key electronics components and devices. Hon Hai and several other Foxconn affiliates on Wednesday announced a deal to take control of Sharp Corp. for about $3.5 billion, adding the Japanese supplier of displays for smartphones to Gou’s corporate empire. Researchers at IDC predicted in December that global smartphone growth will dip below 10 percent this year for the first time.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",
      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBeijing Seeks to Tighten Reins on Websites in China:\\xa0China’s government said on Monday that it would take steps to more strictly manage websites in the country, its latest push to set boundaries in the wider Internet.\\xa0A draft law posted by one of China’s technology regulators said that websites in the country would have to register domain names with local service providers and with the authorities.\\xa0It was not clear whether the rule would apply to all websites or only to those hosted on servers in China. Chinese laws can be haphazardly enforced and are usually vague, and because the new rule is only a draft, analysts said they expected the regulator, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, to specify later to whom the law would apply.\\xa0If the rule applies to all websites, it will have major implications and will effectively cut China out of the global Internet. By creating a domestic registry for websites, the rule would create a system of censorship in which only websites that have specifically registered with the Chinese government would be reachable from within the country.\\xa0If the law applies only to sites hosted in China, it would still represent a consolidation of power by Beijing. Forcing registration with Chinese entities is likely to create a new boom in domain-name service registrars. At the moment, Alibaba operates China’s primary domain-name service provider, called Wan Wang.\\xa0The new rule would also enable the Chinese government to keep closer tabs on the real identities of website operators. It would also help Beijing assemble a registry of important websites if China wants to break away from the global registry that unifies the Internet, Mr. Creemers said. The new rules are the latest in a string of measures taken by the Chinese government under President Xi Jinping to assert control over the Internet. This year, regulators created rules to block foreign companies from publishing online content in China without the government’s consent. Regulators also shut down the social media accounts of the sharp-tongued tycoon Ren Zhiqiang.\\n\\n\\nGoogle Fiber is officially adding phone service for $10 a month:\\xa0Many people can already buy TV and Internet service from Google Fiber. Now, the company that brought gigabit speeds to Austin and Kansas City is moving deeper into the telecom industry by offering its own bundled telephone service.\\xa0For $10 a month, Google Fiber customers soon will be able to buy an add-on known as Fiber Phone — a service that, according to a company blog post, appears to mimic much of the functionality of Google Voice. Voicemail on Fiber Phone can be automatically transcribed and sent to your email. You\\'ll get unlimited domestic calling, as well as international calls at Google Voice\\'s rates. And you\\'ll have access to one phone number that can be set up to ring all of your phones — whether landline or mobile.\\xa0A series of leaked emails in January first uncovered Google Fiber\\'s plans to move into phone service. But now the decision is official: Fiber Phone will roll out gradually across all of the company\\'s existing markets. The company declined to name the initial launch markets, saying those details will come later.\\xa0The service comes with a little black box that sits beside your home phone. It has both ethernet and phone jacks, and will work with most handsets except for old rotary phones, according to Kelly Mason, a company spokesperson. Google Fiber\\'s effort to draw in phone customers highlights how the company is becoming more like traditional service providers even as many telecom companies are looking to become more like Internet content firms. Even providers of cellphone service have been shifting their focus away from voice and toward the more lucrative provision of mobile data. Reports this week suggest T-Mobile may soon unveil new phone plan options that eliminate voice service entirely to give you a bigger bucket of data.\\xa0Fiber Phone fits within these trends in that it would help customers add some cloud-based functionality to their home phones. But it\\'s not immediately clear why consumers would pick Fiber Phone over Google Voice. The two services share many of the same features, but Fiber Phone carries a subscription cost and requires an at-home installation that you don\\'t need with Google Voice. In this respect, Google Voice might be considered a \"better\" service.\\n\\n\\nInstagram’s New Algorithm Means the Free Ride May Be Over for Brands:\\xa0Instagram is testing a new algorithm, which means the company is (or soon will be) choosing which posts users see in their feed and in what order.\\xa0That could be a good thing for users. It means that, if the algorithm works, you should see the best photos and videos every time you open the app.\\xa0For brands, though, especially those that rely on the app to reach their customers for free, the algorithm news is less than stellar. Influencers are getting nervous too. That’s because an algorithm gives Instagram control over what you see, but also what you don’t see.\\xa0The fear among some brands is that the new Instagram algorithm will relegate their posts to the sidelines. What happened with Facebook is this: It originally encouraged brands and businesses to build followings for their Pages, and even offered ad units specifically intended to acquire more “fans.” The idea was that more followers meant more people would see the company’s posts in their feed, so brands paid willingly to acquire them.\\xa0Then Facebook slowly pulled the rug. Little by little it changed its algorithm until posts from brand Pages were seen by just a fraction of users who followed the Page. In 2012, Facebook announced organic posts only reached 16 percent of a Page’s fans, and encouraged brands to pay to sponsor their posts instead.\\xa0Brands are bracing for a similar change with Instagram.\\n\\n\\nNo One Wants to Be ‘the Next Square’ Anymore:\\xa0Makers of once-prominent credit card readers are retrenching or outright folding after Square’s disappointing IPO. A year ago, being known as the “Square of Canada” was a badge of honor. Payfirma Corp.’s smartphone-compatible credit card readers were in high demand, and local investors supplied the Vancouver startup with $13 million in funding. Like Jack Dorsey, the chief executive officer of Square Inc. (and Twitter Inc.), Payfirma CEO Michael Gokturk said he was aiming for “hypergrowth.” Gokturk doubled his staff to 80, including a chief operating officer formerly of Intuit Inc., and started talking about an initial public offering.\\xa0But by November, being the “Square of” anywhere suddenly wasn’t such a hot title. That month, Square sold shares in an IPO that valued the company at about $2.9 billion, less than half its private valuation from a year earlier. In the runup to the IPO, analysts began questioning whether the card-reader maker should really be priced like a high-flying tech company. Its stock price is hovering around $13, right where it was after its first day of trading. “Now that they started going through the rigors of a public market, you can see that their market is actually quite limited,” said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. “It’s going to be much harder going forward for companies that try to emulate their model to raise capital.”\\xa0\\n\\n\\nSnapchat Adds Voice, Video Calling to Mobile Messaging App:\\xa0\\xa0Snapchat, operator of a popular social-messaging app, released an update that steps up competition with Facebook Inc., owner of rival mobile communication services Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp.\\xa0Los Angeles-based Snapchat bolstered its chat function with multimedia features including voice and video calling and digital stickers. Called Chat 2.0, the feature emulates \"face-to-face communication,\" while making it easier to switch between video chatting, texting and calling, Snapchat said Tuesday in a blog post.\\xa0WhatsApp introduced voice calls last year, but users are still waiting for video calling. Facebook’s Messenger communications app added this video capability in April.\\xa0Last week, Fortune reported Snapchat acquired Bitstrips, a Toronto-based maker of personalized avatars or \"bitmojis.\" Snapchat declined to comment on the acquisition, which Fortune said was worth about $100 million. The deal suggests Snapchat will make its stickers more customizable in the future.\\n\\n\\nSpotify Expected to Sign $1 Billion Financing Deal:\\xa0Spotify is about to close on a $1 billion deal that would double the amount of financing the music-streaming company has raised since its founding a decade ago, people briefed on the matter said Tuesday.\\xa0The money comes in the form of convertible debt, which allows Spotify’s investors to change their securities into equity at a future date, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deal was not yet public.\\xa0By using convertible debt, Spotify obtains the funds, without needing to change its valuation. The terms of the debt, however, may put pressure on the company to go public sooner. The company had an equity value of $8.4 billion last year.\\xa0Funds associated with the private equity firm TPG as well as the investment firm Dragoneer put in $750 million of the $1 billion, with the rest coming from other institutional investors, the people said. The transaction, which was placed by Goldman Sachs, is expected to close on Friday, they said. The terms give the investors the ability to convert to equity at a discount to an initial public offering price, two of the people briefed on the matter said. The discount increases if Spotify waits longer than a year to do so, they said. The coupon payment on the debt would also continue to rise over time, the people said.\\xa0The deal is similar to the one that Goldman Sachs arranged for Uber in January 2015. The ride-hailing company raised $1.6 billion in convertible debt. Should the company not go public within a certain time, the interest rate on those securities would climb.\\xa0TPG Special Situations Partners, an $18 billion fund within TPG that does transactions other than leveraged buyouts, participated in the deal, as did TPG Growth, which has invested in other start-ups like Uber and Airbnb.\\xa0Spotify may use the funds for acquisitions, investments and international expansion, the people said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nU.S. Says It Has Unlocked iPhone Without Apple:\\xa0The Justice Department said on Monday that it had found a way to unlock an iPhone without help from Apple, allowing the agency to withdraw its legal effort to compel the tech company to assist in a mass-shooting investigation.\\xa0The decision to drop the case — which involved demanding Apple’s help to open an iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, a gunman in the Decembershooting in San Bernardino, Calif., that killed 14 people — ends a legal standoff between the government and the world’s most valuable public company. The case had become increasingly contentious as Apple refused to help the authorities, inciting a debate about whether privacy or security was more important.\\xa0Yet law enforcement’s ability to now unlock an iPhone through an alternative method raises new uncertainties, including questions about the strength of security in Apple devices. The development also creates potential for new conflicts between the government and Apple about the method used to open the device and whether that technique will be disclosed. Lawyers for Apple have previously said the company would want to know the procedure used to crack open the smartphone, yet the government might classify the method. A second law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reporters in a conference call said that a company outside the government provided the F.B.I. with the means to get into the phone used by Mr. Farook, which is an iPhone 5C running Apple’s iOS 9 mobile operating system. The official would not name the company or discuss how it was accomplished, nor would officials say whether the process would ultimately be shared with Apple.\\n\\n\\nOculus Rift Review: A Clunky Portal to a Promising Virtual Reality:\\xa0Oculus, the virtual reality company that Facebook acquired for $2 billion two years ago, released its much-hyped Oculus Rift system on Monday. With a headset, camera and game controller, the system, which costs $1,500 when bundled with a powerful computer, is the first virtual reality product of its kind to reach consumers, before similar ones coming this year from HTC and Sony. Over the last week, I tested the Rift and many pieces of content for the system to see how true Mr. Zuckerberg’s words might ring. I can report that while the Rift is a well-built hardware system brimming with potential, the first wave of apps and games available for it narrows the device’s likely users to hard-core gamers. It is also rougher to set up and get accustomed to than products like smartphones and tablets. The Setup:\\xa0The Rift works with technology that some might find anachronistic: a Windows PC, monitor, keyboard and mouse. With many people shifting away from desktop computers toward laptops, tablets and smartphones, finding a place to install the Rift and those other components may be a challenge. If you purchase the Rift, you had better have thick skin. The aesthetic of the headgear — it looks like a pair of black ski goggles with air traffic controller headphones built into the sides — is not designed to get you a date. And since wearing the Rift makes users less aware of the outside world, videos and photos of them donning the contraption — and taken without their knowledge — may end up on Instagram or Facebook. I became a subject of ridicule when my partner was watching TV and I crouched in the middle of the living room while playing the dead space pilot game.\\xa0The Rift has other consequences for the mind and body. I felt mentally drained after 20-minute sessions. My eyes felt strained after half an hour, and over a week I developed a nervous eye twitch.\\xa0Oculus recommends Rift owners ease into the headset: Use it a few minutes at a time initially, then gradually increase the amount of time. All Rift users should take short breaks after every 30 minutes of use, the company said.\\xa0The headset may also leave lasting impressions, or what I call “nerd paint,” on your face. After a long session, the Rift left two sets of parallel horizontal lines under my eyes. When it comes down to it, I don’t disagree with Mr. Zuckerberg that this is just the beginning of virtual reality. With about 30 games and a few apps available at Rift’s introduction, there isn’t much to do with the system yet. Oculus will eventually need a larger, more diverse set of content to transcend its initial audience of gamer geeks.\\n\\n\\nPandora Media\\'s founder returns as CEO; shares fall:\\xa0Online music streaming service Pandora Media Inc (P.N) appointed founder Tim Westergren as its chief executive to replace Brian McAndrews, who left the company on Monday, sending its shares down 10 percent. Pandora, whose shares had fallen 32.5 percent in the last 12 months, faces stiff competition from Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon.\\xa0\"I\\'m sure the stock performance was a factor in McAndrews\\' departure,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter told Reuters.\\xa0Pandora last month reported disappointing fourth-quarter results with active listeners of 81.1 million at the end of December, a slight fall from a year earlier.\\xa0The company had said it planned to invest $345 million in 2016 to expand its paid subscription service and enter new markets, with an aim to achieve $4 billion in revenue by 2020. It reported revenue of $1.16 billion for 2015.\\xa0\"McAndrews was pretty ambitious, and my guess is that Westergren will be a bit more deliberate, so we will likely see a slower roll out of their international expansion,\" Pachter said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn Yahoo, Another Example of the Buyback Mirage: It is one of the great investment conundrums of our time:\\xa0Why do so many stockholders cheer when a company announces that it’s buying back shares?\\xa0Stated simply, repurchase programs can be hazardous to a company’s long-term financial health and often signal a management that has run out of better ways to invest in the business.\\xa0And yet investors love them. \\xa0Not all stock repurchases are bad, of course. But given the enormous popularity of buybacks nowadays, those that are harmful probably outnumber the beneficial.\\xa0Those who run companies like buybacks because they make their earnings look better on a per-share basis. When fewer shares are outstanding, each one technically earns more.\\xa0But a company’s overall profit growth is unaffected by share buybacks. And comparing increases in earnings per share with real profit growth reveals the impact that buybacks have on that particular measure. Call it the buyback mirage.\\xa0Consider Yahoo. The company bought back shares worth $6.6 billion from 2008 to 2014, according to Robert L. Colby, a retired investment professional and developer of Corequity, an equity valuation service used by institutional investors. These purchases helped increase Yahoo’s earnings per share about 16 percent annually, on average.\\xa0But a good bit of that performance was the buyback mirage. Growth in Yahoo’s overall net profits came in at about 11 percent annually.\\xa0Given these figures, Mr. Colby reckoned that Yahoo, if it had invested that same amount of money in its operations, would have had to generate only a 3.2 percent after-tax return to produce overall net profit growth of 16 percent annually over those years.\\xa0Yahoo is not alone. Mr. Colby conducted a cost-benefit analysis of 26 companies buying back stock versus using that money to invest in a business.\\xa0He found that McDonald’s was another problematic example. Since 2008, McDonald’s has allocated almost $18 billion to buybacks. This has helped produce 4.4 percent increases in annual earnings per share over the period. To equal that growth in overall earnings, the company would have had to generate just a 2.3 percent return on the money it spent buying back stock, Mr. Colby estimated.\\xa0Last November, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded McDonald’s unsecured debt rating, citing its plans to increase its borrowings in part to fund future buybacks.\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft Apologizes After Twitter Chat Bot Experiment Goes Awry:\\xa0Microsoft apologized after Twitter users exploited its artificial-intelligence chat bot Tay, teaching it to spew racist, sexist and offensive remarks in what the company called a “coordinated attack” that took advantage of a “critical oversight.” The company will bring Tay back online once it’s confident it can better anticipate malicious activities, he said. “A coordinated attack by a subset of people exploited a vulnerability in Tay. Although we had prepared for many types of abuses of the system, we had made a critical oversight for this specific attack,” Lee said, without elaborating. The company introduced Tay Wednesday to chat with humans on Twitter and other messaging platforms. The bot learns by parroting comments and then generating its own answers and statements based on all of its interactions. It was supposed to emulate the casual speech of a stereotypical millennial. Some users quickly tried to see how far they could push Tay. \\xa0 In less than a day, Twitter’s denizens realized Tay didn’t really know what it was talking about and that it was easy to get the bot to make inappropriate comments on any taboo subject. People got Tay to deny the Holocaust, call for genocide and lynching, equate feminism to cancer and stump for Adolf Hitler. The worst tweets quickly disappeared from Twitter, and Tay itself also went offline “to absorb it all.” Some Twitter users appeared to think that Microsoft had also manually banned people from interacting with the bot. Others are asking why the company didn’t build filters to prevent Tay from discussing certain topics, such as the Holocaust. The bot was targeted at 18- to 24-year-olds in the U.S. and meant to entertain and engage people through casual and playful conversation, according to Microsoft’swebsite. Tay was built with public data and content from improvisational comedians. It’s supposed to improve with more interactions, so should be able to better understand context and nuances over time. The bot’s developers at Microsoft also collect the nickname, gender, favorite food, zip code and relationship status of anyone who chats with Tay.\\n\\n\\nUber profits elsewhere support \\'sustainable\\' spending in China:\\xa0CEO: Ride hailing app company Uber Technologies Inc is generating more than $1 billion in profit a year in its top 30 cities globally, and partly using that money to bankroll its expansion in China, Chief Executive Travis Kalanick said in an interview.\\xa0The company said in February it was losing more than $1 billion a year in China\\'s red-hot ride hailing market, where it is battling large local incumbents to win customers.\\xa0Kalanick said China was the company\\'s most intense market, but also a crucible for new ideas that it has exported to other markets, and that its investment here was sustainable.\\xa0\"If you took our top 30 cities today, today they\\'re generating over $1 billion in profit a year, just our top 30 cities. And that profit multiplies every year because we\\'re growing,\" he said on the sidelines of the Boao Forum in the Chinese island province of Hainan. Other cities among the 400 where Uber operates were also profitable, he added.\\n\\n\\nSnapchat Is Buying Bitstrips, the Company That Turns You Into an Emoji:\\xa0Snapchat is buying Bitstrips, the company behind the Bitmoji app that lets you create an avatar of yourself to share on social media and over text, according to a source familiar with the deal. Fortune’s Dan Primack, who first reported the news, said Snapchat is paying “in the ballpark of $100 million” for the company, which was founded in 2012. It quickly became popular on Facebook, as users created and shared cartoon versions of themselves in a bunch of different settings. It’s not entirely clear why Snapchat wants Bitmoji, but it feels like a good fit for the company, which has a number of other fun features to help users spruce up their photos and videos. Snapchat allows users to put emojis on photos and videos they send, and has generated a lot of buzz for facial filters that let people distort their faces into different animals or characters. (Facebook just bought a similar company two weeks ago.) Personal emojis are a logical fit in that regard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Uber Model, It Turns Out, Doesn’t Translate:\\xa0Other than Uber, the hypersuccessful granddaddy of on-demand apps, many of these companies have come under stress. Across a variety of on-demand apps, prices are rising, service is declining, business models are shifting, and in some cases, companies are closing down. Here is what we are witnessing: the end of the on-demand dream. That dream was about price and convenience. Many of these companies marketed themselves as clever hacks of the existing order. They weren’t just less headache than old-world services, but because they were using phones to eliminate inefficiencies, they argued that they could be cheaper, too — so cheap that as they grew, they could offer luxury-level service at mass-market prices. So do a lot of other apps offering services across a number of industries. They are super convenient, but the convenience comes at a premium, which seems here to stay. Some of these services could make for fine businesses, but it is hard to call them groundbreaking. After all, paying extra for convenience isn’t really innovative — it is pretty much how the world has always worked. Before we get to why many on-demand apps have struggled to achieve mass-market prices, it is important to remember why anyone ever thought they could: because Uber did it. The ride-hailing company that is valued by investors at more than $60 billion began as a luxury service. The magic of Uber was that it used its growth to keep cutting its prices and expand its service. Uber shifted from a convenient alternative to luxury cars to an alternative to taxis to, now, a credible alternative to owning a car. But Uber’s success was in many ways unique. For one thing, it was attacking a vulnerable market. In many cities, the taxi business was a customer-unfriendly protectionist racket that artificially inflated prices and cared little about customer service. The opportunity for Uber to become a regular part of people’s lives was huge. Many people take cars every day, so hook them once and you have repeat customers. Finally, cars are the second-most-expensive things people buy, and the most frequent thing we do with them is park. That monumental inefficiency left Uber ample room to extract a profit even after undercutting what we now pay for cars.\\xa0But how many other markets are there like that? Not many. Some services were used frequently by consumers, but weren’t that valuable — things related to food, for instance, offered low margins. Other businesses funded in low-frequency and low-value areas “were a trap,” Mr. Walk said.\\n\\n\\nWhy you should be skeptical that any video is real:\\xa0Be careful about believing what your eyes are telling you. Researchers have shown how a video of a person talking can be altered in real time to change what a speaker appears to be saying.\\xa0In a new video, the scientists show how they edited YouTube clips to change mouth movements. The system uses a webcam to track one person’s facial expressions, and then applies them to the face of the person in the target video.\\xa0The software creates a 3D representation of a subject’s face, which can then be swapped with the 3D representation of another face. The process works even if one subject has facial hair or a different skin tone. But it won’t work if a person’s long hair blocks his or her mouth. Currently the researchers are considering commercializing the technology for use in TV shows that are re-released in a different language. Editing actors’ facial movements to match the audio should make the dubbed programs seem more natural, even if what’s onscreen is actually fake.\\n\\n\\nSquare Teams Up With Facebook to Offer Ads That Can Be Gauged:\\xa0On Wednesday, Square announced a new integration with Facebook. Under the integration, small businesses that use Square to process payments can buy and target Facebook advertising using Square’s software. Square will make subscription fees off the new product. Small businesses can benefit from the move because Facebook ads bought through Square’s platform are directly connected to sales activity and data, Square said. That will allow business owners to understand whether their Facebook ads are working to attract new and repeat customers. The Facebook ad integration is just the most recent new line of business for Square, which went public in November. When the company began in 2009, it focused on providing a square credit card reader that easily attached to smartphones and tablets, giving small, cash-only businesses the ability to accept credit cards. Square takes a small percentage of each transaction, a fee it splits with credit card companies and other financial intermediaries. But as Square has grown, the company has diversified from that payments processing core, which some analysts and investors have criticized for having overly thin margins. Square now offers cash advances to merchants through Square Capital, scheduling with Square Appointments and food delivery with Caviar. The company has also begun offering other subscription-based products to businesses, like an email marketing service linked to sales history. The new Facebook advertising integration was spurred by an acquisition of talent and technology from a start-up called LocBox a few months ago. Square hired Mr. Mehta and his colleagues from LocBox, which specialized in online marketing for small and local businesses, to work on similar advertising technology at Square. The new lines of business still account for far less revenue than Square earns by processing payments. But Square believes that as more small businesses begin adopting its full array of products, these nascent revenue streams will grow. Two weeks ago, Square reported its first quarterly earnings as a public company, posting a 49 percent revenue increase to $374 million for the fourth quarter from a year ago, with sales from its software and data products more than tripling.\\n\\n\\nWhy I’m skeptical about Apple’s future:\\xa0Facebook is set to release its virtual reality headset, Oculus, next week. It will be big and clunky, expensive, and cause nausea and other problems for its users. Within a few months, we will declare our disappointment with virtual reality itself while Facebook listens very carefully to its users and develops improvements in its technology. Version 3 of this, most likely in 2018 or 2019,will be amazing. It will change the way we interact with each other on social media and take us into new worlds — like the holodecks we saw in the TV series Star Trek.\\xa0This is the way innovation happens now. You release a basic product and let the market tell you how to make it better. There is no time to get it perfect; it may become obsolete even before it is released.\\xa0Apple hasn’t figured this out yet. It maintains a fortress of secrecy and its leaders dictate product features. When it releases a new technology, it goes to extremes to ensure elegant design and perfection. Steve Jobs was a true visionary who refused to listen to customers — believing that he knew better than they did about what they needed. He ruled with an iron fist and did not tolerate dissent of any type. People in one division of Apple also did not know what others in the company were developing, that is the type of secrecy the company maintained. Jobs’s tactics worked very well for him and he created the most valuable company in the world. But without Jobs — and given the dramatic technology changes that are happening, Apple may have peaked. It is headed the way of IBM in the ’90s and Microsoft in the late 2000’s. Consider that its last major innovation — the iPhone — was released in June 2007.\\xa0Since then, it has been tweaking its componentry, adding faster processors and more advanced sensors, and releasing this in bigger and smaller form factors—as with the iPad and Apple Watch. Even the announcements that Apple made Monday were uninspiring: smaller iPhones and iPads. All it seems to be doing is playing catch up with Samsung, which offers tablets and phones of many sizes and has better features. \\xa0It has been also been copying products such as Google Maps and not doing this very well.\\n\\n\\n\\nShopify Doubles Down on ‘Buy’ Buttons Despite Sluggish Start:\\xa0Last year certainly wasn’t the year of the “Buy” button that some envisioned, but Shopify is betting that 2016 could be.\\xa0The e-commerce company, which makes software that small businesses use to sell products online, is expanding the number of online sales channels its customers can sell through as shopping on mobile devices booms. The new channels include product discovery app Wanelo, home design site Houzz and coupon app Ebates; Shopify said that more are on the way.\\xa0“This is a continued bet on distributed commerce,” said Satish Kanwar, Shopify’s director of product.\\xa0The expansion follows Shopify’s previous work to let its merchants start selling directly on Twitter, Facebook and Pinterest, in addition to their own sites. But shopping on Pinterest got off to a slow start last year, and e-commerce efforts on Twitter and Facebook are still in early stages.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber-Ola battle goes from the streets to court:\\xa0Uber alleges Ola employees are making bookings on its platform by creating fake accounts, seeks Rs50 crore in damages; Ola denies the charges. Uber alleged that Ola is intentionally causing it to lose sales. Uber alleged in court that Ola’s employees are making bookings on Uber’s platform by creating fake accounts and then cancelling them. This is the equivalent of a shopping site’s employee placing orders on a rival site and then returning the goods for no good reason. Uber calculated the total loss incurred by it because of such alleged practices by Ola and sought damages worthRs.496,164,780 from the latter. A total of “93,859 fake accounts” have been created by Ola, which have been used to make “4,05,649 false bookings” across various cities that were later cancelled, it said. Such cancellations roughly amounted to 8-10% of its total bookings, Uber added. Uber and Ola are fighting for dominance of India’s cab business that, according to Ola’s largest investor SoftBank Group, may be worth $7 billion by 2020. Justice Vipin Sanghi, who was hearing the matter, issued notices to both ANI Technologies Ltd (Ola) and Serendipity Infolabs (TaxiForSure, acquired by Ola) asking for replies to be filed before the next date. Ola’s statement denying all allegations was also recorded. A day after Alexander’s interview was published, a senior Ola official said the company’s newly launched low-cost offering, Micro, will soon do more daily cab rides than all of Uber India.According to US-based Uber, the company has wiped out Ola’s massive lead in a year. “In January last year, we were at 5% market share. Now we are right at the edge of 50%. I would say that within the next 30 days we would beat them (Ola). We will surpass them very, very shortly,” Alexander had said in an interview on 16 March.\\n\\n\\nChip-Card Payment System Delays Frustrate Retailers:\\xa0Avi Kaner, a co-owner of the Morton Williams supermarket chain in New York, has spent about $700,000 to update the payment terminals at his stores. Trouble is, he cannot turn them on. The new terminals can accept credit and debit cards with embedded digital chips, a security feature intended to reduce the number of fraudulent purchases. But before the payment systems can work, they must be certified, a process that Mr. Kaner and many retailers around the country are waiting to happen. In the case of Morton Williams, the holdup has lasted several months. The cost of waiting, retailers say, is piling up. Until recently, banks covered much of the cost of fraudulent purchases. Since Oct. 1, though, merchants that cannot accept chip cards have had to shoulder the cost of fraud, and banks have not been shy about passing along the bill. “It’s been very frustrating,” Mr. Kaner said in an interview last week at his office in the Bronx, the home of his family-owned business. He bought most of the equipment he needed before Oct. 1, he said, and has been waiting months to get it certified. The delay, he said, pointing to a tall pile of paperwork, has cost him thousands of dollars in payments for fraudulent purchases. The long delays are just the latest black eye for the deployment of the new systems. Some consumers have not yet received new cards. Many merchants have not bought the updated equipment. And even when the cards and the terminals have been updated, they have generated confusion and slow lines. Many of the complications were widely predicted, but the certification system has added an unexpected wrinkle — and lots of finger-pointing. Banks say that retailers waited till the last minute to update their terminals. Retailers point to financial ties between the banks and the companies that provide certification, saying there is no motivation to move faster.\\n\\n\\nUber offers hackers \\'treasure map\\' to find computer flaws:\\xa0Uber, the high-flying transportation firm, is releasing a technical map of its computer and communications systems and inviting hackers to find weaknesses in exchange for cash bounties. While so-called \"bug bounties\" are not new, Uber\\'s move shows how mainstream companies are increasingly relying on independent computer researchers to help them bolster their systems. It also indicates growing acceptance of the idea that making computer code public can make systems more secure, a philosophy that has long been advocated by the open-source software movement. Uber\\'s “Treasure Map” details the ride-hailing company\\'s software infrastructure, identifies what sorts of data might be exposed inadvertently and suggests what types of flaws are the most likely to be found. HackerOne, a San Francisco rival called Bugcrowd and other startups have helped accelerate efforts to tap the independent security community to identify serious programming mistakes before criminals or spies do. They can serve as intermediaries between researchers and companies, and sometimes vet their findings.\\xa0A decade ago, hackers pointing out problems feared arrest but they can now earn modest sums from platforms like HackerOne. Firms such as Uber, looking to bolster their defenses, don’t pay as much as criminals and military contractors who are looking for tools to carry out offensive attacks, but they offer options to those who would prefer to act as \"white hats.\"\\xa0Bugcrowd Chief Executive Officer Casey Ellis said he has seen a surge in corporate clients asking for private bounty programs that are open to selected researchers.\\xa0“That increases the amount of trust you are giving to the researchers,” Ellis said. “We run trusted programs where people get prerelease versions of Internet of Things devices or access to source code.\\n\\n\\nDomo takes on Slack with $130 million at $2 billion+ valuation:\\xa0Utah-based Domo has been a force in the enterprise space for a few years with its data management platforms, but the team is poised for growth with an additional $130 million in Series D funding from existing and new investors, including BlackRock, Credit Suisse and others. These $130 million are an addition to Domo’s previously announced $200 million Series D round. The company says it is now valued at $2 billion. \\xa0“We didn’t need the money,” Domo founder and CEO Josh James said of the funding round. He called it a “nice buffer,” but insists that the team didn’t need the cash and plans to go public within the year. Domo also today launched its app store, a mix of about 1,000 free and freemium apps, which can be customized for any company. The company is also introducing a free messaging service with threaded conversations, which James refers to as a Slack competitor. With more than 1,000 customers, including eBay and MasterCard, James said the team has achieved $100 million in bookings so far and that revenue is doubling. Domo has 800 employees and may hire another 500 in 2016. James previously founded web analytics platform Omniture, taking it public and eventually selling it to Adobe for $1.8 billion. The serial entrepreneur thinks he has what it takes to build something even bigger.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple’s Modest Product Upgrades Take Back Seat to Worries on iPhone Encryption:\\xa0Apple held one of its regular product showcases on Monday, but this time the products did not take center stage.\\xa0Before the Silicon Valley giant unveiled modest upgrades to its device lineup, Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, defended the company’s stance in its fight with the federal government over the encryption on iPhones.\\xa0The case had been expected to head to a court hearing on Tuesday, but the Justice Department abruptly moved on Monday to cancel the hearing, saying it might not need Apple’s help to break into the phone used by a gunman in last year’s San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting.\\xa0In a news conference at Apple’s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters, Mr. Cook stressed that the company would stand fast. “We need to decide as a nation how much power the government should have over our data and over our privacy,” Mr. Cook said. “This is an issue that impacts all of us, and we will not shrink from this responsibility.”\\n\\n\\n\\nA Smaller iPhone, Cheaper iPad and Watch at Tepid Product Event By Apple:\\xa0\\xa0Apple introduced a smaller iPhone, a smaller iPad Pro and new bands for the Apple Watch. The company introduced smaller versions of its flagship iPhone and iPaddevices, hoping to eke out more sales growth by filling gaps in its product lineup.\\xa0The new devices, the iPhone SE and a 9.7-inch iPad Pro, represent a return to the form factors that prevailed before Apple supersized its smartphones in 2014 and added the large, business-oriented iPad Pro last year. So Apple upgraded the components of its new four-inch phone to largely match the speed and features of its flagship iPhone 6s, but at a lower price, starting at $399. The new 9.7-inch iPad Pro brings some of the features of last year’s 12.9-inch iPad Pro, including a stylus, a keyboard and four speakers, to a tablet the size of the consumer-oriented 9.7-inch iPad Air 2. The new Pro will start at $599, and Apple also cut the price of the Air 2 by $100 to start at $399. Apple also reduced the price of the Apple Watch by $100, to $299, and introduced new woven nylon wristbands for the device. More than one-third of Watch owners have more than one band, Mr. Cook said.\\xa0Analysts say sales have been modest for the watch, which works as a companion to the iPhone. The price cut might encourage more people to give it a try. But Apple also acknowledges that the smartwatch category is in its infancy and it may take several more generations of the device before it really catches on.\\n\\n\\nApple\\'s new iPhone faces challenge measuring up in China, India:\\xa0Apple\\'s new iPhone SE has first-rate features and a relatively low price tag, but its prospects in key markets like China and India may be limited by its diminutive size.\\xa0At the product launch in Cupertino, California on Monday, Apple vice president of iPhone Product Marketing Greg Joswiak singled out China as a target market, saying four-inch displays like that on the iPhone SE were still popular with first-time smartphone buyers.\\xa0Chinese buyers tend to start off with a phone with a 4-inch screen, just like the iPhone SE, he argued.\\xa0China, Apple\\'s second-biggest market, and India, one of the fastest-growing major markets in the world, are both seen as key for Apple, which expects overall iPhone sales to contract.\\xa0The iPhone SE is seen as particularly important for India, where Anshul Gupta, research director at Gartner, expects the smartphones market to double to 200 million units in the next two years.\\xa0But in India and China, smartphones are often the main connection to the digital world, and a big screen is highly valued, analysts said.\\xa0\"(In India) the majority of the low-end, $100 phones have a five-inch display. The key reason being smartphone users are becoming more mature are preferring bigger screen size as many of them don\\'t own a tablet or laptop,\" said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Technology Market Research based in Mumbai.Only 10 percent of smartphones sold in India at the end of December had a four-inch screen, according to Counterpoint, and Apple accounted for only two percent of overall smartphone shipments in India last year.\\n\\n\\nAndy Grove, Valley Veteran Who Founded Intel, Dies at 79:\\xa0Andy Grove, who escaped the ruins of postwar Europe to become one of the architects of Silicon Valley’s growth into the world’s center of technology creation, died Monday. He was 79. The Hungarian-born refugee was one of the founders of Santa Clara, California-based Intel, playing a key role in building the company from a startup in the 1960s to the world’s largest semiconductor maker, a title it still holds. Grove, who literally wrote the book on how to foresee and overcome a corporate crisis with “Only the Paranoid Survive,” also broke new ground by making the component maker a household name central to the worldwide adoption of the personal computer.\\xa0\\xa0Arriving in the U.S. with less than $20 in his pocket, Grove was taken in by relatives in New York. He studied chemical engineering at City College and graduated at the top of his class, teaching himself English along the way.He moved to the West Coast to attend the University of California at Berkeley, where he earned a Ph.D. in chemical engineering in 1963. After graduating, he joined\\xa0Fairchild Semiconductor, home to a future group of semiconductor industry leaders who would give Silicon Valley its name. In 1968, he followed Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce out the door as Intel’s first hire. For the founders of Intel, Grove was the perfect fit. Moore and Noyce, both inventors in their own right, were opposite personalities: one studious and low-key, the other a born salesman. In the middle was Grove, a writer of scientific textbooks who brought a fear of failure to the laid-back culture of Silicon Valley in the early 1970s. As a detail-obsessed taskmaster, he forced Intel workers, including Moore, to sign in if they arrived at work after 8 a.m. Always seeking to pass along the benefits of his experiences, Grove acted as a mentor to many of Silicon Valley’s elite -- from Larry Ellison and Steve Jobs to Mark Zuckerberg.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA beginner’s guide to finally buying a virtual reality headset:\\xa0if you are interested in being an early adopter, \\xa0here\\'s a quick guide of the basics, plus a little input from my experiences with these products.

Earlier on Friday, Germany\\'s Manager Magazin reported that Uber had placed an order for at least 100,000 Mercedes S-Class cars, citing sources at both companies.\\xa0The top-flight limousine, around 100,000 of which Mercedes-Benz sold last year, does not yet have fully autonomous driving functionality. Auto industry executives are wary of doing deals with newcomers from the technology and software business who threaten to upend established business models based on manufacturing and selling cars.\\xa0\"We don\\'t want to end up like Nokia\\'s handset business, which was once hugely profitable...then disappeared,\" a second auto industry source said about doing a deal with Uber. A key hurdle to driverless cars has been the question of liability in the event of an accident. Most countries are signatories to the 1968 United Nations Convention on Road Traffic which stipulates that a person, rather than a computer, must be in control of a vehicle.\\xa0In February this year, U.S. vehicle safety regulators softened the rules to allow driverless cars, by saying an artificial intelligence system piloting a self-driving Google car could be considered the driver under federal law, a major step toward ultimately winning approval for autonomous vehicles on the roads.\\n\\n\\nHow real businesses are using machine learning: There is no question that machine learning is at the top of the hype curve. And, of course, the backlash is already in full force: I’ve heard that old joke “Machine learning is like teenage sex; everyone is talking about it, no one is actually doing it” about 20 times in the past week alone.But from where I sit, running a company that enables a huge number of real-world machine-learning projects, it’s clear that machine learning is already forcing massive changes in the way companies operate. So where is it happening? Here are a few behind-the-scenes applications that make life better every day.\\xa0Making user-generated content valuable:\\xa0The average piece of user-generated content (UGC) is awful. It’s actually way worse than you think. It can be rife with misspellings, vulgarity or flat-out wrong information. But by identifying the best and worst UGC, machine-learning models can filter out the bad and bubble up the good without needing a real person to tag each piece of content. Pinterest uses machine learning to show you more interesting content. Yelp uses machine learning to sort through user-uploaded photos. NextDoor uses machine learning to sort through content on their message boards. Disqus uses machine learning to weed out spammy comments.\\xa0Finding products faster:\\xa0Successful e-commerce startups from Lyst to Trunk Archive employ machine learning to show high-quality content to their users. Other startups, like Rich Relevance and Edgecase, employ machine-learning strategies to give their commerce customers the benefits of machine learning when their users are browsing for products.\\xa0Engaging with customers:\\xa0You may have noticed “contact us” forms getting leaner in recent years. That’s another place where machine learning has helped streamline business processes. Instead of having users self-select an issue and fill out endless form fields, machine learning can look at the substance of a request and route it to the right place. Understanding customer behavior: Machine learning also excels at sentiment analysis. And while public opinion can sometimes seem squishy to non-marketing folks, it actually drives a lot of big decisions. For example, say a movie studio puts out a trailer for a summer blockbuster. They can monitor social chatter to see what’s resonating with their target audience, then tweak their ads immediately to surface what people are actually responding to - that puts people in theaters.\\nWhy unicorns falter:\\xa0In early February 2016, a study of financing deals reported by The Wall Street Journal found that investors are increasingly protecting themselves from IPOs that don’t perform as expected. This fallout is a continuation of the demise of the so-called “unicorn,” a tech startup with a pre-IPO valuation of over one billion dollars.\\xa0As these companies secure late-stage funding before their public market exit, smart private investors are setting terms that ensure they don’t lose a dime if the IPO falls short of expectations. This comes at a great cost to the startup if the exit doesn’t deliver, as was the case for many of the IPOs of 2015. The unicorn investment cycle has been consuming the growth ramp of an IPO-bound company. Unlike previous eras when a public exit occurred earlier in the company’s growth, leaving the best days ahead of the company, the fastest growth for an IPO-bound startup now happens in the last funding rounds before an IPO. This leaves a 20-30 percent growth rate post-IPO, which is pretty good for a company at $100-$200 million/year revenue, but bad for anyone looking for greater than 2X ROI from an IPO investment. Addressing these issues requires a little course correction as companies work toward an IPO. To ensure ample room for future growth, a startup should be careful not to push its market cap too high by taking more funding rounds than needed during the growth-stage period before IPO. This can be a challenge because funding often generates media interest and credibility, which are certainly not things a young company wants to leave on the table.\\xa0However, leaving a portion of its growth for the IPO will ensure that the company has enough runway to continue to grow and deliver for its public market investors, just as the company has done for its VCs. Otherwise, you create yet another unicorn where the late-stage investors garner all the potential gains, and even force guarantees on returns. This is bad for new investors in the open market, and worse for the employees of the company who only receive poor post-lockup stock performance as compensation for years of hard work and sacrifices.\\n\\n\\nFacebook\\'s Zuckerberg meets propaganda czar in China charm drive:\\xa0Facebook\\'s co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg met China\\'s propaganda tsar Liu Yunshan in Beijing on Saturday as part of a charm offensive in one of the few markets where the social network cannot be accessed. The rare meeting, reported by China\\'s state news agency Xinhua, suggests warming relations between Facebook and the Chinese government, even as Beijing steps up censorship of and control over the Internet. Liu, who sits on the Communist Party\\'s Politburo Standing Committee which is the apex of power in China, praised Facebook\\'s technology and management methods, Xinhua said. Zuckerberg was in Beijing for the China Development Forum, a government-sponsored conference bringing together top business executives and the country\\'s ruling elite.

On Friday, Zuckerberg posted an image of himself running through smog in Beijing\\'s Tiananmen Square, past the portrait of the late Chairman Mao Zedong hanging over the Forbidden City. The 31-year-old has achieved celebrity status in China, one of the few markets where Facebook and other foreign Internet platforms, including Alphabet Inc\\'s Google services and Twitter Inc, are not available due to tight government controls. He has long sought to improve his company\\'s relationship with the Chinese authorities, and now sits on the advisory board of the School of Economics and Management at China\\'s elite Tsinghua University.\\n.\\n\\n\\n')\n",

Google and Toyota declined to comment, and Amazon didn’t respond to requests for comment. Google acquired Boston Dynamics in late 2013 as part of a spree of acquisitions in the field of robotics. The deals were spearheaded by Andy Rubin, former chief of the Android division, and brought about 300 robotics engineers into Google. Rubin left the company in October 2014. Over the following year, the robot initiative, dubbed Replicant, was plagued by leadership changes, failures to collaborate between companies and an unsuccessful effort to recruit a new leader.\\xa0At the heart of Replicant’s trouble, said a person familiar with the group, was a reluctance by Boston Dynamics executives to work with Google’s other robot engineers in California and Tokyo and the unit’s failure to come up with products that could be released in the near term.\\xa0Tensions between Boston Dynamics and the rest of the Replicant group spilled into open view within Google, when written minutes of a Nov. 11 meeting and several subsequent e-mails were inadvertently published to an online forum that was accessible to other Google workers. These documents were made available to Bloomberg News by a Google employee who spotted them.\\xa0The November meeting was run by Jonathan Rosenberg, an adviser to Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Larry Page and former Google senior vice president, who was temporarily in charge of the Replicant group. In the meeting, Rosenberg said, “we as a startup of our size cannot spend 30-plus percent of our resources on things that take ten years,\" and that \"there’s some time frame that we need to be generating an amount of revenue that covers expenses and (that) needs to be a few years.\"\\n\\n\\nAlibaba is working to bring virtual reality into its e-commerce services:\\xa0Alibaba has formally thrown its hat into the virtual reality ring after the Chinese e-commerce giant announced its own VR research lab, dubbed GnomeMagic Lab.\\xa0The company invested in red hot augmented reality company Magic Leap earlier this year, in a deal that put Alibaba vice chairman Joe Tsai on the board, and it has tinkered with 360 degree panoramic video for Youku Tudou — the Chinese video site it invested in and is in the process of acquiring for $3.5 billion — but this is its official entry into the space.\\xa0Alibaba, which claims 400 million users across its services, said that GnomeMagic Lab will work with its shopping businesses with a view to integrating VR into the shopping experience while exploring other applications, such as video with Youku Tudou and entertainment via Alibaba Pictures.\\xa0In a press announcement, former Facebook engineer Zhao Haiping, who is on the Alibaba’s GnomeMagic Lab team, said VR could enable customers to shop virtually on New York’s Fifth Avenue from the comfort of their own home. On a more practical level, Alibaba wants to help merchants use VR to sell on its sites, it said it has already created VR visuals for hundreds of products.\\xa0That’s the plan for where Alibaba believes that VR is going, or could go, in the longer term. For now, the company is setting up a store dedicated to VR hardware to help companies tap into its vast audience.VR is the hot topic of the moment, and it’s more a case of which tech companies aren’t getting into it. Samsung has already shipped a headset. Facebook bought Occulus, which is about to launch its Rift VR and an initial 30 games. HTC’s is arriving imminently and Sony’s effort is also on its way. On the content side, Facebook, YouTube and — today — even British broadcaster Sky are opening themselves up to the virtual future.\\n\\n\\nWhy students are throwing tons of money at a program that won’t give them a college degree:\\xa0One of the biggest booms in the job market right now: an influx of coders graduating from three- to six-month coding crunch programs in lieu of traditional four-year Computer Science degree programs. These for-profit programs, non-accredited and operating without much regulation, have been cropping up in response to a swelling market demand for STEM workers. They vary in quality, but most bootcamps promise steady, high-paying work upon graduation, prompting aspiring coders to invest anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000 of personal money to enroll.\\xa0Now, colleges and universities are teaming up with these private schools, or rolling out their own bootcamp-style programs to offer accelerated coding workshops to their students. Northeastern, UPenn, and Rutgers have announced in-house bootcamps in the couple of months, while Lynn University and Concordia University have paired with programs like General Assembly and The Software Craftsmanship Guild. It’s a response to thetremendous growth in bootcamp enrollment, which increased by 138 percent from 2014 to 2015, compared to more modest growth in traditional Computer Science degrees (14 percent from 2013 to 2014). The demand is clear. But should universities be borrowing bootcamp tactics? O’Neill, who is Principal Architect at Monetate, agrees. He’s skeptical of bootcamper applicants and is more inclined to hire four-year CS degree graduates, especially for the most in-demand positions: “full stack” developers who possess a range of coding skills. He compares the skillsets of bootcampers to performing auto repair on a car, versus the kind of large-scale, architectural skills of your standard CS degree holder, who can do everything from small repairs to making deep structural changes. “You emerge from a bootcamp fit to do an oil change, but not design a car,” he said. A typical four-year CS degree will require students to study theoretical principles of programming on top of straight coding skills. Bootcamps, on the other hand, focus on programming alone, with an emphasis on in-demand languages in popular sectors like app development, functioning more like vocational school. But Anupam Joshi sees the immediate benefits of these programs. He’s Chair of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, which doesn’t currently have plans to incorporate bootcamp style programs into its CS department (though the university does have a “training center” that offers vocational services, including coding). But he appreciates the bootcamps\\' quick adaptability to industry fads and the wider scope of needs they fill amidst the student body. “Bootcamps are good for someone who wants to get an entry level job,” he said of the promotion of coding over theory. “It’s like every other trade.”\\n\\n\\nBlackstone nears $940 million deal to buy HP Enterprise stake in India\\'s MphasiS:\\xa0sources Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) is nearing a deal to acquire Hewlett Packard Enterprise\\'s (HPE) (HPE.N) controlling stake worth about $940 million in Indian IT outsourcing services provider MphasiS Ltd (MBFL.NS), according to three sources directly involved in the deal.\\xa0HPE owns roughly 60.5 percent stake in MphasiS, and the U.S.-based parent had been looking to exit from the Indian venture to shore up its capital.\\xa0Bids for buying the MphasiS stake were submitted earlier this month and the U.S. private equity firm has emerged as the front-runner for taking majority ownership of the mid-sized Indian IT services exporter, the sources said.\\xa0Financial details of the possible deal were not immediately known. Based on MphasiS\\' stock price on Thursday, the HPE stake in the Bengaluru-headquartered company is valued at about $940 million. The company\\'s total market value is about $1.6 billion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFlipkart and Amazon may have explored sale talks, say sources:\\xa0Flipkart reportedly considered selling itself to Amazon, upending the notion that India’s largest online retailer would go full distance as an independent Internet giant. half-a-dozen sources told ET of the discussions between Flipkart and Amazon, and emphasised there is no reason to believe that a deal will be struck or that talks are still ongoing between the two.\\xa0The talks were held until as recently as the last quarter of 2015, one of the sources said. ET was not able to determine the exact timeline of these talks or if they were initiated by one of Flipkart\\'s investors.\\xa0Flipkart itself denied that it is up for sale, or that it is in the market for capital. Three of the sources, who are top-level executives in venture capital and private equity firms, said Amazon made a preliminary offer of up to $8 billion to acquire Flipkart, nearly half of its previous stated valuation of $15.2 billion. A mutual fund managed by Morgan Stanley slashed the value of its Flipkart shares by 27% last month to about $11 billion, increasing speculation that new investors will back the company at a lower valuation. Flipkart-Amazon talks went cold after the offer was perceived to be too low, but the sources said the situation can change given Alibaba\\'s interest in Flipkart.\\n\\nWhat AlphaGo’s sly move says about machine creativity:\\xa0AlphaGo, the computer system Google engineers trained to master the ancient game of Go, needed only one move to make it abundantly clear that it has left humans in its dust.\\xa0The move came Thursday, in the second game of AlphaGo’s 4-1 landmark victory over South Korean Lee Sedol, one of the world’s best Go players. About an hour into the match, AlphaGo placed one of its stones in a nontraditional spot on the board that surprised those watching.\\xa0“I don’t really know if it’s a good or bad move,” said Michael Redmond, a commentator on a live English broadcast. “It’s a very strange move.” Redmond, one of the Western world’s best Go players, could only crack a smile.\\xa0“I thought it was a mistake,” his broadcast partner, Chris Garlock, said with a laugh.\\xa0Sedol, however, was more serious. He stared at the board, then got up from the table and left the room.\\xa0As Sedol returned after a few minutes and pondered his next move, it became clear that AlphaGo’s move was no mistake. It might be strange, but it definitely wasn’t bad. It was brilliant. \\xa0Sedol would take almost 16 minutes to make his next move. He would never recover, losing the match.\\xa0“Almost no human pro would’ve thought of it, I think,” Redmond said after the match. Pedro Domingos, a computer science professor at the University of Washington and author of “The Master Algorithm,” saw a parallel between AlphaGo’s style and how chess prodigy Bobby Fischer was feared because his early moves were considered too foolish to even be made. But as Fischer’s matches wore on, the ill-advised moves suddenly looked genius.\\xa0“If that’s not creative, then what is?” Domingos asked. He sees machines delivering creative results, and they’re just getting started. Domingos believes a computer eventually will write a best-selling book. And he thinks there’s a 50-50 chance that a computer writes a hit pop song in the next decade, given advances in artificial intelligence techniques and computing power.Domingos said such advances shouldn’t come as a surprise, as machines increasingly demonstrate that creativity isn’t magical and distinctly human.\\n\\n\\nApple looks to Google’s Cloud Platform as it diversifies its infrastructure:\\xa0Rumors are flying today that Apple is moving part of its cloud business from AWS to Google’s Cloud Platform. We did some asking around and yes, it does appear that Apple has made some moves to diversify its iCloud storage, tapping Google for some of that business.\\xa0This is another huge win for Google and a — at the very least perceived — loss of ground for AWS, which has watched as Dropbox moved large parts of its US storage business in-house and Spotify moved at least part of its business to Google, too.\\xa0If you’re keeping score, it’s been a good month for Google and especially the new head of its cloud business Diane Greene. High profile clients like Spotify and Apple would certainly make it more attractive to other enterprise customers. Google’s Cloud Platform may have the power of Google’s data center technology behind it, but that hasn’t yet helped the company in competing against AWS and Microsoft’s Azure platform. AWS has the advantage of an early start and Azure profits from Microsoft’s existing sales channels and it’s focus on hybrid cloud technologies. And even with the power of Microsoft behind it, though, Azure remains a distant second in the cloud business.\\xa0One industry insider who chose not to be identified, however, told TechCrunch that Apple was definitely exploring its options around public cloud vendors, looking at Microsoft Azure and Google, but it had not made any firm decisions yet. It’s worth noting that Apple already uses \\xa0Azure (and AWS) for iCloud services and media serving.\\xa0Whether Apple will continue moving off of AWS and onto other platforms is anyone’s guess. But at the moment it appears that this is a matter of diversifying its portfolio of cloud suppliers.\\xa0Another wrinkle here is that Apple is currently expanding its data center in Prineville, Oregon, and is also expected to invest heavily in new data centers in both the U.S. and Europe. If that’s the case, moving from AWS to Google, then Google to Prineville wouldn’t seem to make sense. Why not just wait until the data center construction is complete?If Apple is indeed simply looking to diversify its infrastructure, though, then adding Google (on top of Azure, AWS and its own data centers) would be a fairly logical move. It’s also possible that Apple is only looking at some very specific services on the Google cloud, with theBigQuery data analytics platform being the prime suspect here.\\n\\nMorgan Stanley Downgrades LinkedIn, Slashes Price Target by 34 Percent:\\xa0Why we were wrong\" isn\\'t a phrase one might want to include when sending out a note to clients, but it\\'s what Morgan Stanley analysts were forced to deploy on Wednesday morning as they downgraded LinkedIn Corp.\\xa0The shift from \"overweight\\' to \"equalweight,\" is the latest in a series of cuts for LinkedIn after it reported lackluster earnings last month that sent shares tumbling by more than 40 percent the following day. \\xa0\"With its current product offering, LinkedIn isn\\'t likely to be as big of a platform as we previously thought,\" the team, led by Brian Nowak, said. \"We are reducing our price target to $125 [per] share (from $190) as well, driven by our lower long-term cash flow forecasts and increased execution uncertainty.\" Two key factors that had kept Morgan Stanley bullish are now abating. The first was growth in LinkedIn\\'s Talent Solutions segment, which includes such things as subscription revenue. Nowak and his team now believe that growth has slowed both domestically and internationally for this segment and that the increased focus on small- and medium-sized businesses betokens that LinkedIn is hitting a peak when it comes to larger companies.\\xa0The second was the monetization potential in new segments, known as Lynda and Sales Navigator. Recent events have caused the team to grow skeptical.\\n\\n\\nOracle Increases Buyback Program by $10 Billion:\\xa0\\xa0Oracle reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and increased its stock buyback program by $10 billion.\\xa0Oracle, like other established tech companies, is moving its business to the cloud by providing services remotely through data centers versus selling installed software. Total cloud revenue rose 39.5 percent to $735 million, accounting for about 8 percent of Oracle’s total revenue. Net income fell to $2.14 billion, or 50 cents a share, in the third quarter, from $2.50 billion, or 56 cents a share, a year earlier.\\xa0Excluding items, the company reported a profit of 64 cents a share. Revenue fell 3.4 percent to $9.01 billion. Shares rose more than 4 percent in after-hours trading.\\n\\n\\nBeyond Swipe Right: The Pickup Line Gets a Makeover:\\xa0Thanks to the popular dating app Tinder, a one-size-fits-all gesture of approval, swipe right, has in theory replaced awkward fumbles at an opening conversational gambit. But in fact, the migration of courtship online has resulted in a refinement of pickup lines far beyond ’70s singles-bar relics like “Hey baby, what’s your sign?” and “Are those space pants? Because your butt is out of this world.” The simple “Hi” and its variations are the surest ways to end a conversation; they’re too generic and, lately, indistinguishable from the way bots initiate contact. Only those with the most flattering profile pictures can get away with generic questions like “How was your weekend?” A more common approach in Tinder-land is to quickly skim the other person’s profile and find something to comment on — a detail from a photo, or a line of profile text. Statements tend to work better than questions as conversation starters; they’re less personal and invite reactions and commentary rather than disclosure. With the help of a friend, Brent Bailey, 24, a programmer in New York, came up with a successful opener to someone who mentioned her life being “a bit messy” in her profile. “I could make your life a whole lot messier,” he responded. Mr. Bailey said he was more successful with crowd-sourced pickup lines. “As a rule, my friends are way less concerned about my dignity, so they usually come up with something way more interesting than I would,” he said. On the dating service Bumble, where women must initiate all conversations, Ms. Smothers decided to try what she called a “dumb troll-y” gimmick — asking every match if he was a feminist. Men loved it, and she got a high response rate she has yet to match.\\n\\n\\nLivingSocial is laying off more than half of its workers:\\xa0LivingSocial will cut more than half of its workforce, according to anannouncement from the company saying it has completed its \"initial phase of turnaround.\" The move is the latest sign of the decline of \"daily deal\" sites once thought of as the next big thing for online shopping. The sites typically offered users heavily discounted vouchers at local businesses in exchange for a cut of deal sales. But some business complained that the model wasn\\'t actually a good deal for them -- and consumers seemed to tire of the flood of emails sent by the services. The latest job cuts are part of a series of layoffs. The local company cut 400 jobs in 2014 and another 200 in October of last year. Competitor Groupon has also struggled: In September it announced it would lay off 1,100 people -- roughly 10 percent of its workforce -- and close operations in six countries. LivingSocial plans to move away from the voucher business, but hopes to expand \"card-linked\" discounts, according to the press release. The company is trying out a program called Restaurant Plus in handful of cities that works by letting customers reserve a deal with payment card information on file, but not charging them for it until it\\'s actually used.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSony PlayStation VR to launch globally in October, cost $399:\\xa0Sony Corp announced on Tuesday that its virtual reality headset for PlayStation will launch globally in October for $399, a move that undercuts its biggest competitor by hundreds of dollars.\\xa0Andrew House, head of Sony\\'s gaming division, made the announcement during a press event at the Video Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, where virtual reality gaming counterpart Oculus Rift announced its headset a day earlier.\\xa0The headset, a visor-style frame with a 5.7 inch (14.5 centimeters) screen, includes 360 degree head tracking, a 100 degree field of vision and latency of 18 milliseconds between the time a user\\'s head moves and the time they see the correct image. At $399,the package is notably less than the $599 price announced Monday by Facebook-owned virtual reality company Oculus Rift. Oculus will also sell bundles that include an Oculus Ready PC and a Rift for preorder in February starting at $1,499. The company said more than 230 developers are building content for the PlayStation VR device and 50 games are expected to be ready by the launch date. Users can download the Playroom VR at the PlayStation store and play six free games.\\xa0The company has also teamed up with development company EA Sports and Lucasfilm for a Star Wars Battlefront game that will be released as a PlayStation VR exclusive.\\n\\n\\nUber Could Give Us a Lesson in Productivity:\\xa0In Los Angeles, traditional taxi drivers have a passenger in the car for 40.7 percent of the miles they drive. By contrast, Uber drivers have a passenger in the car for 64.2 percent of their miles, or a 58 percent higher capacity utilization rate. In Seattle, the other city surveyed with mileage data, Uber drivers were 41 percent more productive. When measured by time, Uber drivers in Boston, San Francisco and New York on average have a passenger in their car about half the time their smartphone app is turned on. That compares to a range of 32 percent of the shift for taxi drivers in Boston to 49.5 percent for cabbies in New York. The service\\'s use of internet-based mobile technology to connect passengers and drivers certainly contributes to its efficiency, according to the report. It makes sense: tapping your smartphone screen a few minutes before you need a ride is often easier than waiting on a street corner and hoping an empty cab drives past. Meanwhile Uber allows drivers to set their own shifts, and when combined with their use of so-called surge pricing that increases fares during times of increased ridership, supply and demand are more smoothly matched. Uber drivers are also exempt from regulations that prevent taxi drivers who drop off a passenger in a jurisdiction outside the one that granted their occupational license from picking up another customer in the same location. Given their 38 percent advantage, Uber drivers could charge 28 percent less than traditional taxis and still earn the same amount per hour under certain assumptions, including ignoring fixed costs, according to Cramer and Krueger. That may be one reason investors last year valued the company at $62.5 billion, more than Ford Motor Co., \\xa0General Motors Co., and 80 percent of companies in the S&P 500.\\n\\n\\nInstagram is switching its feed from chronological to best posts first:\\xa0The average Instagram user misses 70 percent of what’s in their feed, including great photos with tons of Likes and posts by their best friends. So today Instagram announced it will start rearranging the order of posts in its feed. Rather than strictly reverse chronological, Instagram will order posts “based on the likelihood you’ll be interested in the content, your relationship with the person posting and the timeliness of the post.”\\xa0The testing will start out slowly; at least at first “all the posts will still be there, just in a different order.” But eventually, low-quality posts might be filtered out entirely.\\xa0The changes mean if you don’t check your feed until the next morning but a friend whose photos you usually Like posted something awesome the night before, it could appear at the top of your feed even if it is hours old. This is essentially how Facebook’s feed works, and how Twitter recently reconfigured its feed to work. On the one hand, the relevancy-optimized Instagram feed will make sure you don’t miss great content even if you don’t neurotically check it all the time. You’ll be able to follow more accounts without worrying about them drowning out your favorites. And it will be easier to keep up with international friends who might normally post while you’re asleep.\\xa0At the same time, remixing the feed will make Instagram less useful as a real-time content feed because the most recent posts won’t necessarily be at the top. Users will have to worry about making their posts good enough to be chosen by the algorithm or their posts could be de-prioritized. And brands might lose the reach of a previously reliable marketing channel, the same way they did with Facebook Pages.\\xa0Filtered feeds tend to score more attention from users, as there are few boring posts that push them to close the app and do something else. And at this point, Instagram is so ingrained in people’s lives that they’re unlikely to ditch it over this change. But with Instagram and Twitter both moving to algorithmically sorted feeds, getting seen on social media will become more of a competition than ever.\\n\\n\\nLinkedIn’s Lynda.com Videos Are Now Free on Some Commercial Flights:\\xa0Here’s a tip for helping your video content stand out online: Make sure people see it when they don’t have many other options. That’s exactly what LinkedIn is doing to promote Lynda.com, the library of online classes it bought last year for a whopping $1.5 billion. LinkedIn announced Tuesday that it’s partnering with Virgin America to offer those classes for free to in-flight passengers. Beginning in April, a handful of classes will be free on all Virgin flights, and the entire Lynda.com library will be free for flights with higher quality Wi-Fi technology. No money is changing hands as part of the partnership, according to a LinkedIn spokesperson, but the potential benefits to LinkedIn are simple enough to understand. You’ll still need a Lynda.com account to watch videos, so it may help LinkedIn sign up more users. Plus, the competition for eyeballs on an airplane is usually pretty weak. The chance to learn a new skill or brush up on stress management may seem more appealing than random episodes of “Deadliest Catch” or “Cupcake Wars,” especially to business travelers. It’s basically a free opportunity to introduce its video library to potential new users — in the hope they will like the videos enough to pay for them sometime later down the road. If not, it still doesn’t cost LinkedIn anything in the process. It has offered free Lynda.com courses before. But this move does show how serious the company is about generating attention for Lynda.com. It paid a lot of money for the online classroom, and now it’s working to make it all back.\\n\\n\\nUber India Is Working on Offering Ride-Booking on Snapdeal:\\xa0Uber’s India arm is in talks to partner with Indian e-commerce platform Snapdeal, multiple sources told Re/code. If a deal is reached, Snapdeal shoppers in India would be able to hail an Uber from within the newest iteration of Snapdeal’s app, these people said. As of March 9, Snapdeal had only released its new app to a select group of its customers, but indicated in a company blog post it would soon roll out to a larger group of users. The newest version of the Snapdeal app already includes integrations with travel booking service Cleartrip, food-delivery service Zomato and bus-booking service Redbus. As Snapdeal CEO Kunal Bahl told Re/code last April, the company believes it can differentiate from e-commerce competitors Flipkart and Amazon by broadening its focus beyond selling physical retail products. Last year, Snapdeal acquired FreeCharge, a recharge service for prepaid phones, and RupeePower, a comparison site for credit cards and loans. “What’s the delta between retail and consumption?” Bahl asked rhetorically. “It’s things like financial services, education, utilities, health care. But today, all everyone is doing is products.”\\n\\n\\nIndia Opens Market for Solar Battery Makers Such as Tesla:\\xa0India plans for the first time to include energy storage as a requirement when a solar project is tendered this month, opening what could become a significant new market to battery makers such as Tesla Motors Inc., Samsung SDI Co. and Panasonic Corp.\\xa0The state-owned Solar Energy Corp. of India, which is responsible for implementing the government’s green targets, will ask bidders to include a storage component in 100 megawatts of the 750 megawatts of solar capacity tendered in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, Managing Director Ashvini Kumar said in an interview.\\xa0The intention of the pilot program is to reduce fluctuations in electricity supply in order to make possible the transfer of clean energy between states. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a goal of 175 gigawatts of clean energy by 2022. The Andhra Pradesh project include 15 minutes of storage each for two solar installations.\\xa0Warehousing power is considered a crucial component of India’s green targets. The requirement, if more broadly adopted, has the potential to invigorate the storage market because of India’s outsized ambitions for the industry. It would give manufacturers the scale they need to help bring down costs of battery storage that are holding back wider adoption.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWall Street Tours the Tesla Factory—and Loves What It Sees:\\xa0Wall Street analysts have been touring Tesla’s massive factory in Fremont, Calif., and they\\'re returning with the same conclusion: Elon Musk\\'s electric-vehicle company is getting ready for something big. In a sign of this enthusiasm, Robert W. Baird & Co. upgraded its Tesla rating on Monday morning following a factory tour. Last week, Stifel analysts returned from their fourth visit in four years to Tesla’s flagship factory in Fremont. “In roughly one year since our last visit,” wrote analyst James Albertine, “the progress witnessed is truly stunning.\" \\xa0Tesla shares have jumped 45 percent in the past month as Musk, the chief executive, sought to reassure investors that the company is still on track after the challenging and much-delayed launch of the Model X luxury SUV. \\xa0Stifel and Credit Suisse both noted Tesla\\'s new aluminum stamping press, which Credit Suisse\\'s Galves says has 10 to 20 times the output of \\xa0Tesla\\'s older machine. The bodies of the Model S and Model X are both made of aluminum, which costs twice as much as steel but weighs less. Tesla hasn\\'t yet disclosed the composition of the Model 3. Keeping the weight down on electric vehicles helps achieve the maximum range on the battery, but maintaining a balance between cost and performance is crucial for a mass-market plug-in car.\\xa0Tesla has built a new state-of-the-art paint shop that\\'s capable of scaling up to 500,000 cars a year. That happens to be Tesla\\'s production forecast for 2020, a 10-fold increase from last year\\'s sales. If Tesla is to achieve that lofty goal, paint jobs won\\'t be a holdup.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat New Delhi’s free clinics can teach America about fixing its broken health care system:\\xa0Rupandeep Kaur, 20 weeks pregnant, arrived at a medical clinic looking fatigued and ready to collapse. After being asked her name and address, she was taken to see a physician who reviewed her medical history, asked several questions, and ordered a series of tests including blood and urine. These tests revealed that her fetus was healthy but Kaur had dangerously low hemoglobin and blood pressure levels. The physician, Alka Choudhry, ordered an ambulance to take her to a nearby hospital.\\xa0All of this, including the medical tests, happened in 15 minutes at the Peeragarhi Relief Camp in New Delhi, India. The entire process was automated — from check-in, to retrieval of medical records, to testing and analysis and ambulance dispatch. The hospital also received Kaur’s medical records electronically. There was no paperwork filled out, no bills sent to the patient or insurance company, no delay of any kind. Yes, it was all free.\\xa0The hospital treated Kaur for mineral and protein deficiencies and released her the same day. Had she not received timely treatment, she may have had a miscarriage or lost her life. The technology that made the instant diagnosis possible at Peeragarhi was medical device called the Swasthya Slate. This $600 device, the size of a cake tin, performs 33 common medical tests including blood pressure, blood sugar, heart rate, blood haemoglobin, urine protein and glucose. And it tests for diseases such as malaria, dengue, hepatitis, HIV, and typhoid. Each test only takes a minute or two and the device uploads its data to a cloud-based medical-record management system that can be accessed by the patient.\\xa0The Swasthya Slate was developed by Kanav Kahol, who was a biomedical engineer and researcher at Arizona State University’s department of biomedical informatics until he became frustrated at the lack of interest by the medical establishment in reducing the cost of diagnostic testing. He worried that billions of people were getting no medical care or substandard care because of the medical industry’s motivation in keeping prices high. In 2011, he returned home to New Delhi to develop a solution. By Jan. 2013, Kahol had built the Swasthya Slate and persuaded the state of Jammu and Kashmir, in Northern India, to allow its use in six underserved districts with a population of 2.1 million people. The device is now in use at 498 clinics there. Focusing on reproductive maternal and child health, the system has been used to provide antenatal care to more than 22,000 mothers. Of these, 277 mothers were diagnosed as high risk and provided timely care. Mothers are getting care in their villages now instead of having to travel to clinics in cities. A newer version of the Slate, called HealthCube, was tested last month by nine teams of physicians and technology, operations, and marketing experts at Peru’s leading hospital, Clinica Internacional. They tested its accuracy against the western equipment that they use, its durability in emergency room and clinical settings, the ability of minimally trained clinicians to use it in rural settings, and its acceptability to patients. Clinica’s general manager, Alvaro Chavez Tori, told me in an email that the tests were highly successful and “acceptance of the technology was amazingly high.” He sees this technology as a way of helping the millions of people in Peru and Latin America who lack access to quality diagnostics.\\n\\n\\nGoogle Will Let Mobile Games Stream in Search So That Mobile Game Makers Will Buy Search Ads:\\xa0Google will let you try out a mobile game right inside the search results page, before downloading it. And Google will let game developers pay for the privilege. It’s part of Google’s ongoing effort to squeeze more ad revenue from mobile and its business cornerstone, search. For developers, the trick offers a new avenue — paid search — for recruiting new users. Most money for gamers is made inside the app, so some developers may be reluctant to move away from direct downloads. But, in theory, the streaming method lets them grab devoted game players who have tried out the game, like it, and will stick around and buy stuff therein. For Google, it’s another way to nab the ample flow of app promotional dollars — a flow that Facebook has largely cornered. Over the past year, Google has rolled out a stream of mobile app advertising tools as the company has prioritized ways to fortify its central business. It added ads to the Play store so developers could pay to get noticed there. In November, Google started testing app streaming in organic search results with a handful of apps; it brought the feature to ads within apps a month later. Now, developers can promote their apps with streaming inside search, too. Google’s share of app advertising is rising steadily, although Facebook is still out in front, according to industry sources.\\n\\n\\nInfibeam turns profitable; to open first IPO by an Indian e-com venture on March 21:\\xa0The parent of horizontal e-commerce platform Infibeam and e-commerce enabler BuildaBazaar, is to hit the market with its initial public offer (IPO) on March 21. This would make it the first among peers, including those several times bigger, to go public. Infibeam had received a green signal from securities market regulator SEBI for its initial public offering (IPO) to raise up to Rs 450 crore last October. \\xa0Founded in 2010 by a former Amazon executive, Vishal Mehta, Infibeam would also become one of the youngest firms to list on a national bourse. Having restricted itself from raising private capital, unlike its peers, it did not get too aggressive in customer acquisition to drive the B2C business and has been especially pushing the B2B e-commerce enabler platform BuildaBazaar. Infibeam would be the first pure-play e-commerce firm in the country to float an IPO in India and would test the general investors’ appetite for the sector. E-commerce in India has absorbed billions of dollars over the past four years, much of it from foreign private equity and venture capital firms. Infibeam happens to be an exception as it has not approached any major private investor for funds till now. It is promoted by a Gujarat-based affluent family whose business interest straddles a dealership for Toyota cars. Interestingly, Infibeam made profit in the first six months of the current financial year. It reported net revenues of Rs 171.27 crore for the April-September 2015 period with EBITDA of close to Rs 15 crore and net profit (adjusted for prior period items) of Rs 6.5 crore. It had clocked net loss of just under Rs 10 crore for 2014-15. As of December 31, 2015, it had 48,724 registered merchants on the BuildaBazaar platform. In Infibeam.com e-retail site, in addition to direct sales procured from suppliers, it had more than 5,000 registered merchants, and claimed to have more than 7.8 million active users (based on last login in the immediately preceding 12 months). To its credit, it is one of the rare horizontal e-commerce platforms to have survived without large external funding. Others like IndiaPlaza shut down as they failed to get follow-on funding, and as a consequence, investors funding got concentrated to the troika of Flipkart, Snapdeal and ShopClues. Global e-commerce behemoth Amazon itself has built a big presence in India and is among the top three ventures in the country. Infibeam’s only external equity funding has come from media house Bennett, Coleman & Co Ltd, which bet around Rs 33.3 crore through the ad-for-equity investment platform Brand Equity Treaties Ltd (BETL). BETL owns a 1.8 per cent stake in the firm. BETL also pitched in with Rs 2 crore of non-convertible debentures, which are outstanding.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nModeled After Ants, Team of Just Six Tiny Robots Can Move 2-Ton Car:\\xa0Archimedes pointed out that with a lever he could move the world.\\xa0He most likely would have been surprised to learn that a team of six microrobots, weighing just 3.5 ounces in total, could pull a car weighing 3,900 pounds. A group of researchers at the Biomimetics and Dexterous Manipulation Laboratory at Stanford University has been exploring the limits of friction in the design of tiny robots that have the ability to pull thousands of times their weight, wander like gecko lizards on vertical surfaces or mimic bats.\\xa0Now they have pushed biomimicry in a new direction. They have taken their inspiration from tiny ants that work as teams to move massive objects. In this case, they are not just taking ideas from nature — the movie “Big Hero 6” made a great deal of what swarms of microrobots could do, including tossing cars.\\xa0The researchers’ approach is counterintuitive. Rather than striking powerful blows like a football player making a tackle or a jackhammer, they have focused on synchronizing the smooth application of very tiny forces. The microrobots work in concert, if slowly.\\xa0The researchers observed that the ants get great cooperative force by each using three of their six legs simultaneously. Their new demonstration is the functional equivalent of a team of six humans moving a weight equivalent to that of an Eiffel Tower and three Statues of Liberty, Mr. Christensen said. The car is the one he uses for commuting to campus. Part of the magic is the use of a special adhesive that was inspired by gecko toes.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIndia\\'s Micromax, once a rising star, struggles:\\xa0A year ago, Micromax vaulted past Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to become India\\'s leading smartphone brand. Today, its market share has nearly halved, several top executives have resigned, and the company is looking for growth outside India.\\xa0In Micromax\\'s slide to second place is a tale of the promise and peril of India\\'s booming but hyper-competitive smartphone industry.\\xa0India is the world\\'s fastest-growing smartphone market. Shipments of smartphones jumped 29 percent to 103 million units last year.\\xa0Rapid growth has helped nurture a crop of local brands, led by Micromax, that outsourced production to Chinese manufacturers. Now, as Samsung rolls out more affordable phones, the same Chinese factories are entering the Indian market with their own brands, depressing prices and forcing Indian mobile makers to rethink their strategies.\\xa0\"What the Indian brands did to the global brands two years ago, Chinese phone makers are doing the same to Indian brands now, and over the next year we see tremendous competition for Micromax and other Indian smartphone makers,\" said Tarun Pathak, analyst at Counterpoint Research in New Delhi. Micromax, which was founded in New Delhi by four partners in 2000 but only began selling mobile phones in 2008, built its market share by working with Chinese manufacturers such as Coolpad, Gionee and Oppo to offer affordable phones quickly. In 2015, it launched more than 40 new models.\\xa0In 2014, the founders brought in outside managers to lead the company at a time when Micromax was challenging Samsung to become the largest mobile phone maker in India.\\xa0But tensions arose soon after between founders and the newly hired executives, six former executives told Reuters. These conflicts undermined Micromax\\'s attempts to raise funds for expansion, say former executives. Last May, Alibaba walked away from a mooted $1.2 billion purchase of a 20 percent stake, citing a lack of clarity on growth plans, according to one executive involved in the discussion. Former executives said the lack of fresh funding undermined a proposal by the new executives to move Micromax\\'s research and design operations, which had previously been outsourced, in-house. The move was intended to help Micromax differentiate itself from generic Android clones.\\xa0\"We hired about 80-90 people in Bangalore to do in-house software and design, but with no money from the investors and little interest from the founders, that team fizzled away and that office has been partially shut down now,\" said a former executive.\\xa0After Alibaba walked away, Micromax struggled to attract other investors who would have been key to Micromax\\'s plan to invest in software R&D and hardware design. The company was forced to scale down the in-house R&D project, a top executive involved in the fundraising plan said. Meanwhile, Chinese handset makers, including Coolpad and Oppo, to which Micromax outsources its manufacturing, were sharpening their focus on India. Samsung, too, began to introduce more affordable models there.\\xa0In 2015, Chinese brands doubled their market share to 18 percent, according to Counterpoint Research, taking away business from Indian budget phone makers such as Micromax, Intex, Lava and Karbonn. Indian brands\\' market share fell from 48 to 43 percent last year.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow a simple typo helped stop a $1 billion digital bank heist:\\xa0It was just a few letters off: Someone misspelled \"foundation\" as \"fandation\" on an online payment transfer request.\\xa0But that simple typo helped stop hackers from getting away with a nearly $1 billion digital heist last month, Reuters reports.\\xa0Hackers broke into the Bangladeshi central bank\\'s computer systems, according to anonymous officials at the financial institution cited by Reuters, stealing the credentials needed to authorize payment transfers. The attackers used the stolen information to ask the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to make massive money transfers -- nearly three dozen of them -- from the Bangladeshi bank\\'s account with the Fed to accounts at other financial institutions overseas.\\xa0Four transfers to accounts in the Philippines, totaling abut $80 million, worked. But then a fifth request, for $20 million to be sent to an apparently fictitious Sri Lankan nonprofit, was flagged as suspicious by a routing bank due to the \"fandation\" error.\\xa0The Bangladesh central bank was able to stop that transaction after the routing bank asked for confirmation. \"The Sri Lankan bank did not disburse it immediately, and we could recover the full amount,\" the central bank told the Financial Times.\\xa0The requests waiting to be processed -- amounting to a total of between $850 million and $870 million, according to an unnamed official cited by Reuters -- were also halted. So if it weren\\'t for that typo, the attackers may have escaped with an even bigger payday.\\xa0Bangladesh\\'s finance minister has blamed the incident on the Federal Reserve and said his government will \"file a case in the international court against\" the financial institution, according to local outlet the Dhaka Tribune.\\xa0A New York Fed spokesperson denied the accusation, telling The Washington Post in a statement that \"there is no evidence of any attempt to penetrate Federal Reserve systems in connection with the payments in question\" or that the institution\\'s systems were compromised. According to the spokesperson, the payment instructions were \"fully authenticated\" using standard methods.\\n\\n\\nTop Start-Up Investors Are Betting on Growth, Not Waiting for It:\\xa0For the last few years, the spotlight in start-up investing has largely shone on those who poured money into a company when it was already well along on a growth path. It turns out that spotlight may have been misdirected.\\xa0While some investors are throwing giant sums into more mature start-ups like Uber and Airbnb at soaring valuations, it is the venture capitalists who identify a promising company at its infancy and bet on its growth who often come out on top.\\xa0Known as early-stage investors, they dominate a list of the top 20 venture capitalists worldwide that was recently created by the research firm CB Insights. About three-quarters of the top 20 are investors who put money into start-ups during their early rounds of financing. Only a handful on the list are focused on investing at a later stage in a company’s life. Early-stage investments have accounted for the lion’s share of the venture industry’s gains since 1994, according to Cambridge Associates, a research firm that studied the quarterly financial reports of dozens of venture firms. Since the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, between two-thirds and three-quarters of the industry’s returns have been generated by early-stage investments in any given year.\\xa0But the value of investing in a company when it is still nascent has been somewhat obscured in recent years as hordes of nontraditional start-up investors — including mutual funds, hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds — have piled into private tech companies, often when those start-ups are already proven growth stories. When Uber raised around $2.1 billion in December, for example, one of its investors was Tiger Global Management, a New York investment firm with a hedge fund component. Rebecca Lynn, a managing director and co-founder of Canvas Ventures who is on the CB Insights list, said early-stage investments generally pay off more because “investors can get more of an ownership stake and you’re also part of the team.”\\xa0Ms. Lynn, who invested early in the alternative lending platform Lending Club, which went public in 2014, added that “later-stage investing is more like a stock bet. You’re along for the ride.”\\n\\n\\nInstacart Gets Red Bull and Doritos to Pay Your Delivery Fees:\\xa0Online shoppers hate paying delivery fees. So Instacart Inc. is getting Pepsi to foot the bill.\\xa0The grocery delivery startup is working with General Mills Inc., Nestlé SA, PepsiCo Inc., Unilever NV, and other consumer goods makers to cover the cost of delivery or provide other discounts when customers buy their products. In addition to the coupons, the companies pay Instacart to advertise on its website. Since introducing the program about six months ago, it now accounts for 15 percent of Instacart’s revenue, said Apoorva Mehta, the company’s chief executive officer.\\xa0Shoppers can find discounts when filling up their carts with brands such as Degree, Doritos, DiGiorno, Häagen-Dazs, Quaker Oats, and Stella Artois. Instacart ads promise free delivery if you spend $10 on Red Bull, or consumers can get 75 cents off any Dove soap. Mehta compares the ads to those offered on the side of Google search results. “It’s like AdWords for groceries,” he said.\\xa0In its quest to build a profitable business, Instacart is searching for new sources of revenue that won’t turn off shoppers. The company, which was valued at $2 billion by investors last year, had previously made up some of its costs by selling products for more than what the grocery stores charged. Customers complained, and Instacart backtracked. The company recently cut pay for some workers, according to reports this week in Quartz and Re/code. Instacart said it costs much more to deliver an order than the $5.99 it charges shoppers, but customers are unwilling to pay more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTechCrunch Sources: India’s Flipkart in talks to raise up to $1b, likely in a down round:\\xa0After years of raising hundreds of millions of dollars to tap into the burgeoning e-commerce market in India, one of the country’s biggest tech companies is facing a markdown in its valuation as it aims to pick up yet more investment. TechCrunch has learned from sources that Flipkart is looking to raise up to $1 billion in funding to grow its business and shore up against competition from local rival Snapdeal and global giant Amazon. “The funding is now delayed and should take another 3-4 months. A downround is certain,” said a source. According to our sources, one potential investor is Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. The company — already a backer of rival Snapdeal — reportedly met with Flipkart management in Hong Kong to discuss investing at less than $10 billion. Other sources say a round would not be this low, and more likely in the range of $11 billion to $14 billion. Alibaba’s alleged interest in Flipkart has been reported previously. Another investor that has been eyeing up a stake in Flipkart is the Fosun Group, sometimes referred to as the Berkshire Hathaway of China. It’s not clear what valuation Fosun has discussed with Flipkart.\\n\\n\\nBox Shares Soar as Sales Rise 36 Percent on Shrinking Losses:\\xa0Shares of cloud storage and collaboration company Box rose by 11 percent in after-hours trading as the company posted fourth quarter results that were better than what analysts expected.\\xa0Box shares rose $1.38 to $13.90 after posting a per-share loss of 26 cents on revenue of $87 million. Analysts had forecast a loss of 29 cents a share and sales of $81.8 million. The company also finished its fiscal year with revenue of $303 million, up 40 percent year-on-year, and an operating loss of $201 million which ballooned from a $166.6 million operating loss in 2015.\\xa0The company said Q1 will come in between $88 million and $89 million with a loss of between 23 and 24 cents, both of which were in line with analysts’ estimates. For the year it expects revenue in the range of $390 million to $394 million, with a loss ranging from 83 to 85 cents. It also said it expects a positive free cash flow from operations — a key milestone toward profitability — in the fourth quarter.\\n\\n\\nPre-Roll Ads For Virtual Reality Are Here:\\xa0Virtual reality is in its “early days” — ask anyone involved in the field and that’s usually their chosen term.\\xa0And as with the genesis of social media, there’s a coming mad dash of people eager for ways to cash in. On Facebook, gaming companies figured out they could spend fistfuls advertising mobile games and get paying users in return.\\xa0A handful of ad veterans who rode that social media wave are now trying to replicate the success on VR. A new startup called Immserv is launching a “first-of-a-kind platform” that lets developers creating VR content promote that content with ads. Their product is essentially a YouTube pre-roll ad, just inside VR devices. Immserv is starting with Google’s Cardboard and Samsung’s Gear VR. Say you’re playing a game in your virtual headpiece (maybe this Firefly Rescue one, designed by Immserv partner Archiact Interactive). A video ad pops up at the onset or in the middle of the game, promoting another game; users are invited to download that app by using the head tracking feature in the VR device.\\xa0The ads are sold on a cost-per-view basis ranging from three to five cents, said Shah. The company has been testing the ads since December and is going live with at least a dozen apps, launching in advance of the Game Developers Conference next week.\\xa0Ads in VR are tricky, partly because of formatting challenges, but more critically because they risk upsetting users coming to the incipient form. “You can absolutely turn off customers if you’re not careful,” said Eric Hine, an executive producer for Archiact Interactive. But he stressed that Immserv ads in his games won’t, because they play like thrilling trailers and only run if consumers opt in.\\xa0The launch also comes at the onset of a pivotal year for VR, as big tech companies hope that consumer enthusiasm for the field approaches the fervor for it inside the big tech companies. Neither Google nor Facebook, massive digital ad sellers, have announced plans to bring ads to their VR efforts.\\xa0Google is testing in-app purchases and pushing the media industry to build VR content for YouTube. These may be indicators of a coming ad model, although the search giant is also pondering a subscription model across several of its products.\\n\\n\\nSalesforce Expands Machine-Learning Service to Microsoft Outlook:\\xa0Salesforce.com Inc. is taking another step forward in its partnership with Microsoft Corp., expanding integration with the Outlook e-mail program to help sales representatives streamline tasks such as scheduling meetings and responding to messages.\\xa0With the new SalesforceIQ Inbox for Outlook application, Salesforce is folding its predictive technology into an e-mail service that has more than 400 million users. The app will let executives work directly from within Outlook on their desktop computers, boosting productivity by automating key steps while interacting with their customers. E-mail continues to be a crucial tool used by sales representatives when they’re trying to land a deal, said Steve Loughlin, chief executive officer of the SalesforceIQ unit.\\xa0“There are all these data sources that sales reps are trying to access -- they’re drowning in the information,\" Loughlin said. \"This is a way to pull it all together into a single place and deliver it where they are working.\" Salesforce is extending the reach of machine-learning technology after acquiring RelateIQ for $390 million in 2014. With Inbox, predictive tools are folded into Outlook to erase manual steps. For example, the program can juggle potential meeting times inside e-mails -- automatically adjusting open calendar spots as they fill up before e-mails are returned. The cooperation between San Francisco-based Salesforce and Microsoft broadens the companies’ growing partnership. About two years ago, the two agreed to make some of their business-software products work better together, signaling a thaw in relations between the longtime rivals.\\xa0“A large number of Salesforce’s large customers are on Outlook,” Loughlin said. \"This is going to be a huge opportunity.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Echo From Amazon Brims With Groundbreaking Promise:\\xa0Many of the world’s largest technology companies have spent the last five years searching in vain for the holy grail, a machine to succeed the smartphone as the next must-have gadget. At the most promising candidate for the Next Great Gadget isn’t made by Apple, Google, Facebook or Microsoft. Instead, it is the Echo, a screenless, voice-controlled household computer built by Amazon — a company whose last big foray into consumer electronics, the Fire Phone, was a humiliating flop. What is most interesting about the Echo is that it came out of nowhere. It isn’t much to look at, and even describing its utility is difficult. Here is a small, stationary machine that you set somewhere in your house, which you address as Alexa, which performs a variety of tasks — playing music, reading the news and weather, keeping a shopping list — that you can already do on your phone. But the Echo has a way of sneaking into your routines. When Alexa reorders popcorn for you, or calls an Uber car for you, when your children start asking Alexa to add Popsicles to the grocery list, you start to want pretty much everything else in life to be Alexa-enabled, too. In this way, Amazon has found a surreptitious way to bypass Apple and Google — the reigning monarchs in the smartphone world — with a gadget that has the potential to become a dominant force in the most intimate of environments: our homes. First, it’s simple to learn, and its voice-recognition capabilities are more intuitivethan those of many other vocal assistants (like Apple’s Siri or Google Now). More than that, it keeps gaining new powers. More important, just like the early iPhone, Amazon has managed to turn the Echo into the center of a new ecosystem. Developers are flocking to create voice-controlled apps for the device, or skills, as Amazon calls them. There are now more than 300 skills for the Echo, from the trivial — there is one to make Alexa produce rude body sounds on command — to the pretty handy. It can tell you transit schedules, start a seven-minute workout, read recipes, do math and conversions, and walk you through adventure games, among other possibilities. Makers of digital home devices like Nest are also rushing to make their products compatible with the Echo. Alexa can now control your Internet-connected lights, home thermostats and a variety of other devices. Hardware makers can also add Alexa’s brain into their own devices, so soon you won’t need an Echo to consult with Alexa — you could find it in your toaster, your refrigerator or your car.\\n\\n\\nDorsey-led Square\\'s revenue beats in first quarterly report since IPO:\\xa0Mobile payments company Square Inc\\'s revenue beat analysts\\' estimates in its first quarterly results since going public in November, easing pressure on CEO Jack Dorsey who is also leading turnaround efforts at Twitter.\\xa0Square\\'s shares rose as much as 7 percent after market on Wednesday, before giving up some of the gains. The stock had closed up 4.8 percent at $12.03 during the day.\\xa0The company\\'s shares have mostly stayed below the first trading close of $13.07 and even slipped below the deeply discounted IPO price of $9, hitting a low of $8.06 on Feb. 3.\\xa0Since then, the stock had risen nearly 50 percent through Wednesday\\'s close.\\xa0The company\\'s gross payment volume (GPV) — the total dollar amount of all card payments processed by sellers — rose 47 percent to $10.2 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. Transaction revenue — earned from businesses processing payments through Square\\'s devices — grew 44.7 percent to $298.5 million. However, Square is facing rising competition in the payments market, from large companies such as PayPal Holdings Inc to smaller startups such as Stripe.\\xa0Also, Dorsey\\'s dual role as CEOs at Twitter and Square has been a sore point with investors at both companies. On his part, Dorsey has looked to play down the concerns.\\xa0Square\\'s total net revenue rose 49.2 percent to $374.4 million in the quarter, beating analysts\\' average estimate of $343.2 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. However, net loss attributable to common stockholders widened to $80.5 million, or 34 cents per share, from $37.1 million, or 25 cents per share. The loss for this quarter included a charge of 14 cents per share due to a stock dividend for holders of one class of preferred shares in the company.\\xa0Square has been investing heavily in new hardware and building out its lending business, Square Capital.\\n\\n\\nMaster of Go Board Game Is Walloped by Google Computer Program:\\xa0A Google computer program stunned one of the world’s top players on Wednesday in a round of Go, which is believed to be the most complex board game ever created.\\xa0The match — between Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo and the South Korean Go master Lee Se-dol — was viewed as an important test of how far research into artificial intelligence has come in its quest to create machines smarter than humans. Go is a two-player game of strategy said to have originated in China 3,000 years ago. Players compete to win more territory by placing black and white “stones” on a grid measuring 19 squares by 19 squares.\\xa0The play is more complex than chess, with a far greater possible sequence of moves, and requires superlative instincts and evaluation skills. Because of that, many researchers believed that mastery of the game by a computer was still a decade away.\\xa0Before the match, Mr. Lee said he could win 5-0 or 4-1, predicting that computing power alone could not win a Go match. Victory takes “human intuition,” something AlphaGo has not yet mastered, he said.\\xa0But after reading more about the program he became less upbeat, saying that AlphaGo appeared able to imitate human intuition to a certain degree and predicting that artificial intelligence would eventually surpass humans in Go.\\xa0AlphaGo posed Mr. Lee a unique challenge. In a human-versus-human Go match, which typically lasts several hours, the players “feel” each other and evaluate styles and psychologies, he said.\\xa0“This time, it’s like playing the game alone,” Mr. Lee said on the eve of the match. “There are mistakes humans make because they are humans. If that happens to me, I can lose a match.” Kim Sung-ryong, a South Korean Go master who provided commentary during Wednesday’s match, said that AlphaGo made a clear mistake early on, but that unlike most human players, it did not lose its “cool.”\\xa0“It didn’t play Go as a human does,” he said. “It was a Go match with human emotional elements carved out.”\\xa0Mr. Lee said he knew he had lost the match after AlphaGo made a move so unexpected and unconventional that he thought “it was impossible to make such a move.”\\n\\n\\nFacebook Buys Face Swapping App Masquerade to Challenge Snapchat\\'s Rainbow Vomit:\\xa0Facebook Inc. said it bought Masquerade, an app that puts fun filters, masks and special effects on selfies and videos like those popularized on the disappearing photo-sharing app Snapchat.\\xa0The company didn’t disclose how much it paid for Masquerade, but said it would keep the application running and incorporate the technology for Facebook users.\\xa0“Over the past year we’ve focused on building out more creative tools for people on Facebook,” the Menlo Park, California-based company said in an e-mail. “Masquerade has great technology to help us bring even more creative tools to Facebook, and help extend this work to video.”\\xa0Facebook is making the move in part amid increasing competition from Snapchat Inc., where silly photo filters have been a major draw. Snapchat debuted the feature last year with one that animates a user’s face so they vomit a rainbow while their eyes bulge, and more recently started using the filters as a revenue source. One of Masquerade’s most popular features is “face swap,” which lets people to trade faces with one another in photos.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShared Office Startup WeWork Raises Funds at $16 Billion Valuation for Asia Expansion:\\xa0\\xa0WeWork Cos., a New York-based shared-office startup, raised $430 million from Chinese investors as it prepares to expand throughout Asia. Investors valued the company at $16 billion as part of the financing round, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the terms were private. Chinese investment firms Legend Holdings and Hony Capital led the round, WeWork said. The real estate startup\\'s website lists China, Hong Kong, India, and Seoul among the places where it will offer service \"soon.\" John Zhao, the chief executive officer at Hony Capital, said in a statement that WeWork\\'s \"fit for the Chinese culture is unparalleled.\" WeWork has about 50,000 members globally, who rent desks and offices in shared spaces operated by the company in 21 cities. Memberships start at $45 a month, and the company is also exploring residential rentals. WeWork is in talks with an Australian developer about forming a global venture to lease offices and living spaces to other companies, Bloomberg reported last week. Corporate documents filed Tuesday night in Delaware show that WeWork has authorized the sale of as much as $780 million in shares as part of the round. Fortune and the Wall Street Journal reported details of the sale earlier. WeWork\\'s last financing round, disclosed in June, valued it at $10 billion.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

The decision to target Apple’s OS X software, which is both harder to hack and less widespread than Microsoft Corp.’s Windows, underscores how attractive the practice has become, according to Clifford Neuman, who teaches cybersecurity at the University of Southern California. Researchers at Palo Alto Networks Inc. discovered the ransomware, which they dubbed KeRanger, on March 4. Once downloaded and installed, the bug demanded that users pay one bitcoin to decrypt the data, or about $411 at Friday’s prices. The researchers informed Apple, which revoked a certificate that allowed Macs to download the software, and Transmission updated its program to eliminate the infection, according to Ryan Olson, intelligence director at Palo Alto Networks. “The business model is working so well on Windows that, when they had an opportunity to do so on Mac, they did it,” Olson said. “It’s been effective to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars a year.”\\n\\n\\nLyft is catching up with Uber in New York City:\\xa0Lyft is gaining momentum in a key market for the company and its more established competitor, Uber. According to figures the company provided to Re/code, Lyft has seen its driver pool grow by a factor of four and has seen six times the number of active weekly riders in New York since May 2015. In February of this year, Lyft drivers in New York performed six times the total number of rides they performed in May 2015, the company said. It’s a clear indicator that New York riders and drivers have warmed up to the pink-mustachioed ride-hailing company despite Uber’s first-mover advantage. The growth in riders is in part a result of the recent fare cuts Lyft implemented across 33 cities, including New York (following Uber’s fare cuts in more than 80 cities), but it also follows the company’s increased investment in its marketing efforts both in terms of staff as well as in promotions and ad buys.\\n\\n\\nAmazon Is Launching a Live QVC-Type Show as Part of Push Into Fashion:\\xa0By some estimates, Amazon could be the No. 1 apparel seller in the U.S. by next year. Now, it’s unveiling a live daily show on Amazon.com to help push that initiative. Called “Style Code Live,” the free 30-minute video show will stream live on Amazon.com each weekday at 9 pm ET. The show will feature fashion and beauty tips and a live chat that the company says will allow viewers to communicate with the hosts. The most Amazon-y piece of the experience, though, will be a product carousel showing viewers the stuff related to the show that they can purchase on Amazon.com. And you have to believe this feature is as much about awareness for Amazon’s clothing-selling business as it is about making direct sales of stuff from the show. It follows last week’s Amazon announcement that it would begin airing a free reality show called “The Fashion Fund,” which documents a competition among up-and-coming fashion designers.\\n\\n\\nSubleases spike in number as SF startups downsize:\\xa0In January, office rents in San Francisco eclipsed those of New York to become the most expensive in the country. Two months later, there are signs the San Francisco may not maintain its dubious position for long. The biggest indicator: There’s suddenly 1.7 million square feet of sublease space available in San Francisco, up more than 50 percent from 1.1 million square feet in November, according to CBRE Group, a commercial real estate services and investment firm.\\xa0That kind of jump in four months’ time suggests ripple effects from a funding slowdown that stretch beyond a small but growing number of layoffs. If the trend isn’t giving local landlords flashbacks of the late 1990s, it may soon. The Bay Area’s real estate market enjoyed a historically active 2015, with San Francisco accounting for the world’s highest rent growth at 14 percent, according to brokerage Cushman & Wakefield. The last time San Francisco surpassed New York in price per square footage, says CBRE, was 2000, the same year the tech market famously peaked, then abruptly imploded.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSnapchat Thinks It Will Generate at Least $300 Million in Revenue This Year: Investors are buying into Snapchat’s massive $16 billion valuation because its business is growing significantly. Or at least expected to grow significantly in 2016. Snapchat is targeting between $300 million and $350 million in revenue in 2016, according to multiple sources familiar with the company’s plans. That’s six or seven times the $50 million in revenue Snapchat projected last year. Snapchat’s business is still new and evolving, and advertiser interest is still very experimental. Essentially that means it can be tough to predict incoming revenue with much accuracy, as most advertisers don’t have Snapchat as a staple of their advertising plans. The company hit a $100 million revenue run rate in Q4, according to one source. Advertising is cyclical, and Q4 is usually a strong advertising quarter, but it’s worth noting because the run rate metric gives us a glimpse at how the business is growing. Still, boosting projected revenue like that must mean the businesses is growing at a nice clip. We don’t know if the $16 billion valuation is pegged to this year’s expected revenue, but if it were, that would amount to more than 50 times this year’s sales. Facebook, by comparison, trades at a value of about 17 times its annual revenue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba\\'s Ant Financial could be valued at nearly $60 billion: source Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba arm, Ant Financial Services Group, is seeking a valuation of nearly $60 billion in its current round of funding, a person familiar with the matter said. Ant Financial, which operates the \"Alipay\" online payment platform, is in talks to raise funds from existing and new investors, which could include CCB International, the person said on Monday. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Monday that Ant Financial planned to raise up to 20 billion yuan ($3.07 billion), pegging its valuation at nearly $50 billion. Ant Financial declined comment on the Journal\\'s story. The latest round of funding is expected to be completed by mid-April, the Journal reported.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTech Companies, New and Old, Clamor to Entice Cloud Computing Experts: The hunt for the hard-to-find talent that can build and run the massive data centers behind cloud computing is pitting three generations of companies against one another. Old-guard companies like Oracle, tech’s current giants like Amazon and its peers, as well as Bay Area start-ups are offering big salaries and big perks for cloud computing experts. On the social media site LinkedIn, for example, there are over 130 engineering positions available at Oracle Seattle. Many of them are the kind of jobs that now pay $300,000 to $1 million a year, according to Shannon Anderson, who has been recruiting engineers in Seattle and the Bay Area for 25 years. Seattle and its surrounding towns are a hot spot for this kind of tech talent because they are home to A.W.S., which runs the biggest cloud computing service, and Microsoft, which has a large cloud business called Azure.Google also has a cloud computing office in the area. So does Facebook.“Someone working deep inside Amazon is getting five to 20 recruiting offers a day,” Ms. Anderson said. “Compensation has doubled in five years.” For a recruiter, who is typically paid a percentage of a star engineer’s compensation, “this is a very good time,” she said. Cloud computing, which powers an increasing number of our devices and services, allows a vast collection of computers — often spread around the world — to operate like one giant machine. As other tech sectors show signs of slowing, cloud services have created unprecedented demand for highly educated engineers and mathematicians who can build and operate these flywheels of data. Instead of asking about the latest computer coding languages or how to make a web page load faster, the most important question in tech hiring has become: Can you handle petabytes? That is the data in about 13 billion images, or roughly the amount of printed information that would fit in 20 million file cabinets. In the Bay Area, $125,000 a year is not an uncommon salary for someone newly out of graduate school with the expertise to do cloud computing work. With five years of experience, $300,000 along with a range of stock or job opportunities that greatly inflate the value of those paychecks have become the norm. “It’s an aggressive market,” said Corey Sanders, director of program management at Microsoft Azure. “We are all data engineers now, and we can convince people that this is the best place to learn that.”\\n\\n\\nPrompt debuts “a command line for the real world”: In a world suffering from app overload, the Y Combinator-backed startup Prompt introduces a different way to interact with services, make purchases or even control “Internet of Things” devices — all by way of text-based interface.

In an effort to discourage stealing, Amazon has put up flatscreen TVs that display examples of alleged on-the-job theft, say 11 of the company’s current and former warehouse workers and antitheft staff. The alleged offenders aren’t identified by name. Each is represented by a black silhouette stamped with the word “terminated” and accompanied by details such as when they stole, what they stole, how much it was worth, and how they got caught—changing an outbound package’s address, for example, or stuffing merchandise in their socks. Some of the silhouettes are marked “arrested.” Theft is a persistent concern for Amazon, with warehouses full of small but valuable items and a workforce with high turnover and low pay. Workers interviewed for this story say the range of thefts posted on the screens is as varied as the company’s sprawling catalog: DVDs, an iPad, jewelry, a lighter, makeup, a microwave, phone cases, Pop Rocks, video games. Several recall a post about an employee fired for stealing a co-worker’s lunch. The digital bulletin boards also occasionally display information about firings related to workplace violence. There are cheerier announcements, too, such as updates on incentive bonuses or a message about Black History Month. In some warehouses that don’t have flatscreens, workers say, tales of firings are posted on sheets of paper tacked to bulletin boards or taped to the wall. Many of the workers say the screens aren’t a top concern compared with wages or workload. “Only people that would have something to say about it is people that’s doing wrong,” says Maurice Jones, a warehouse worker who left Amazon in February. “It’s just letting people know that you’re being watched.” \\xa0\\n\\n\\nApple users targeted in first known Mac ransomware campaign: Apple customers were targeted by hackers over the weekend in the first campaign against Macintosh computers using a pernicious type of software known as ransomware, researchers with Palo Alto Networks told Reuters on Sunday. Ransomware, one of the fastest-growing types of cyber threats, encrypts data on infected machines, then typically asks users to pay ransoms in hard-to-trace digital currencies to get an electronic key so they can retrieve their data. Palo Alto Threat Intelligence Director Ryan Olson said the \"KeRanger\" malware, which appeared on Friday, was the first functioning ransomware attacking Apple\\'s Mac computers. \"This is the first one in the wild that is definitely functional, encrypts your files and seeks a ransom,\" Olson said in a telephone interview. Hackers infected Macs through a tainted copy of a popular program known as Transmission, which is used to transfer data through the BitTorrent peer-to-peer file sharing network, Palo Alto said on a blog posted on Sunday afternoon.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nFCC cracks down on Verizon Wireless for using ‘supercookies’: The Federal Communications Commission is cracking down on Verizon Wireless for using a powerful type of code to track its customers around the Internet, as the agency pushes to increase its role in protecting online privacy. The code, dubbed a \"supercookie\" by privacy advocates, is almost impossible to disable and could allow almost anyone to follow users around the Web. Under the terms of a settlement agreement announced Monday, Verizon must pay a $1.35 million fine and will only be able to use the tracking mechanism when users connect to Verizon\\'s corporate family of services unless the company gets customers\\' opt-in consent. Broader use could leave customers\\' Web habits visible to outsiders. Verizon began putting a unique string of characters into customers\\' web browsing in 2012 to help target its advertising program. The practice came to the public\\'s attention in late 2014, when it received criticism from privacy advocates who called the code a \"supercookie\" because the it was almost impossible for users to avoid. The privacy advocates warned then that other companies, or even intelligence agencies, could leverage the super cookies to track wherever people went online. Verizon downplayed that concern at the time, with a spokesperson saying that the code \"wouldn’t be able to be used for that.\" But last January, researcher Jonathan Mayer revealed evidence that others could hijack the supercookie for their own purposes: An online advertising company called Turn was using the codes to help follow people around online, he said. Turn used the supercookie to \"respawn\" its traditional cookies -- even if users took steps to protect their privacy by removing the cookies. Turn said it would stop and Verizon started offering a way for customers to opt-out of having the supercookie attached to their web traffic. But the FCC had already launched an investigation of Verizon\\'s use of supercookies in December of 2014 \\xa0-- and later brought Mayer on board as the chief technologist for the agency\\'s enforcement arm. While the Federal Trade Commission is often thought of as the government\\'s primary privacy watch dog, the FCC\\'s power to police online privacy got a major boost last year. As a quirk of how the agency moved to enforce network neutrality rules, broadband providers will be subject to new privacy scrutiny. The FCC is in the process of coming up with a version of its privacy rules that apply to broadband Internet providers, which are expected soon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon Introduces 2 Alexa Voice-Controlled Devices:\\xa0Amazon’s Alexa is gaining new powers, and a couple of new looks, too.\\xa0Amazon, the Internet retailer, on Thursday announced two new siblings for the Echo, the voice-controlled household assistant that people address as “Alexa” and that became a surprise hit for the company last year.\\xa0One new product, Amazon Tap, is a slimmer, shorter, portable version of the Echo. Rather than requiring an electrical wall connection, the Tap runs off a rechargeable battery. It connects with phones and the Internet through Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.\\xa0The Tap acts as an ordinary wireless speaker for a phone, but it also provides Alexa on the go. People can ask about weather and traffic, ask for the news, tell it to play a song from a streaming service, or do any one of dozens of other tasks. The device, which will begin shipping at the end of the month, will sell for about $130. Amazon also announced the Echo Dot, essentially an Echo without that device’s powerful speaker. The Dot, which will sell for about $90, looks like a hockey puck, and is meant to provide Alexa’s voice functions for existing speaker systems. The Dot connects to those speakers either through a wire or over Bluetooth; after that, it functions as another Echo.\\xa0Dot shipments also willbegin at the end of March. Sales will initially be limited to people who already own an Echo or one of Amazon’s Fire TV devices — a Dot buyer will have to ask Alexa to order one.\\xa0The new devices suggest that Amazon has an expansive vision for the Echo, which looked like an experiment for the company when it was introduced in late 2014. The company has not provided sales data for the device, but it has said that sales exceeded its expectations and that customer reviews are rhapsodic.\\xa0Amazon appears to have increased investment in the device — it keeps adding new features and capabilities to Alexa, and this year it ran Super Bowl ads about the gadget.\\n\\n\\nEBay Banks on Bar Codes for a Comeback:\\xa0Hoping to outgrow its image as a glorified garage sale and move up in Google searches, EBay is turning to technology developed 70 years ago: the bar code. The machine-readable symbol that keeps supermarket lines moving is helping EBay manage vast amounts of data associated with the 6 billion products—from smartphones to video games, handbags to tires—listed at the online marketplace each year.\\xa0Merchants will be able to enter a full description of a sales item by using a smartphone camera to scan its Universal Product Code. EBay reads the scan and automatically lists the item’s specifications. Before, every detail, including brand, model, and dimensions, was entered manually.\\xa0UPCs are a central part of what EBay calls its “structured data initiative,” started in June, to organize items into a catalog that shoppers can easily search using filters such as price, features, and condition. The switch started with auto parts and accessories, one of EBay’s fastest-growing categories. The UPC is also used to call up consumer reviews and product images, which create a degree of permanence on EBay that search engines will reward with better placement.\\xa0EBay says the code provides a sufficient baseline of information because 80 percent of all products sold there are new. A key goal is to standardize the amount and type of information that merchants list. The initiative will eventually expand to most items on the site.So far, some merchants like the change. Quick Ship Electronics, which sells consumer devices on EBay, had some desktop computers and laptops languishing in its inventory. Once the company entered the UPCs on EBay’s catalog, the items sold within days, CEO Jordan Insley says.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHP Enterprise\\'s revenue, profit beat estimates:\\xa0Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co, which houses former Hewlett-Packard Co\\'s corporate hardware and services division, reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit, helped by strength in its hardware business.\\xa0Hewlett Packard Enterprise\\'s (HPE) shares were up 6.4 percent at $14.47 in extended trading on Thursday.\\xa0Revenue in HPE\\'s enterprise group business, from which it derives more than half of its total revenue, rose about 1 percent to $7.1 billion in the first quarter ended Jan. 31, from a year earlier. The company\\'s revenue fell to $12.72 billion from $13.05 billion.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nApple supplier Broadcom to slash 1,900 jobs globally:\\xa0Chipmaker Broadcom Ltd, the company created following the merger of Avago and Broadcom, said it would cut about 1,900 jobs globally across its businesses.\\xa0Shares of Broadcom, which also supplies to Apple Inc, were up 8 percent at $148.20 in extended trading on Thursday.\\xa0The company said it expects to take charges of about $650 million related to the job cuts through 2018. \\xa0Avago completed its $37 billion deal for Broadcom last month.\\xa0Revenue for the legacy Avago business fell 4 percent to $1.77 billion in the three months ended January 31.\\n\\n\\nSnapchat Raises $175 Million From Fidelity at Flat $16 Billion Valuation:\\xa0Snapchat has raised $175 million in new venture funding from Fidelity at the same $16 billion valuation it raised at back in May, according to a source familiar with the deal.\\xa0That means Snapchat has now raised around $1.4 billion in total. The Wall Street Journalfirst reported the new funding. A flat valuation isn’t usually a great sign, but the raise comes at a time when lots of tech companies — including Jawbone and Foursquare — are raising down rounds, or taking money at a lower valuation than their last fundraising.\\xa0In that vein, this investment doesn’t look bad.\\n\\n\\nFacebook Messenger adds music, starting with Spotify song sharing:\\xa0First came the Transportation hub with Uber, and now Facebook Messenger is launching “its very first music integration” with Spotify.\\xa0Inside the Messenger “More” section in chat threads, all iOS and Android users will now find a Spotify option. Tap it and they’ll be shuttled into Spotify’s app where they can “Search for something to share.” Once they select a song, artist or playlist, they’ll be popped back to Messenger with the option to share the photo of the cover artwork. When a friend taps that photo, they’ll be bounced over to Spotify to listen.If Messenger can become a richer social layer connecting Spotify users, it could inspire deep conversations about music, boosting its engagement. That generates platform lock-in and potential monetization opportunities for Facebook. And for Spotify, Messenger will provide virality that could help it fend off Apple Music and convince more non-streamers of its value.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith Bet on Japan, Sharp Stumbles:\\xa0When flat-screen televisions began replacing boxy analog sets in the world’s living rooms more than a decade ago, few companies bet bigger on the new technology than Sharp of Japan.\\xa0The century-old manufacturer, which got its start making belt buckles andmechanical pencils before World War I, defied corporate orthodoxy by building an advanced new display factory in its homeland, while rivals outsourced to cheaper countries.\\xa0The gamble paid off — for a while. Made-in-Japan Kameyama model TVs, named for the factory, became a hit, and Sharp reaped big profits.\\xa0“We were winners then,” said Yukihiko Nakata, an engineer who worked for 33 years at Sharp.\\xa0Those days are over. Sharp is now mired in losses and its future is in doubt. Sharp’s plight is a story of missteps by executives who failed to anticipate major shifts in the global electronics industry. China, long the home of cheap manufacturing, has become increasingly sophisticated, making gadgets that can rival Japan’s in quality. Rivals elsewhere are challenging Japanese companies on innovation. The industry’s center of power has moved away from Japan to places like China, South Korea and Silicon Valley in the United States.\\xa0Sharp’s leaders were slow to adapt, employees and industry experts say. Unwilling to change strategy when business conditions turned against them, they doubled down on investments in increasingly unprofitable businesses, deepening the company’s financial distress.\\xa0As prices of liquid-crystal displays, or LCDs, began falling quickly in the mid-2000s, because of advances in manufacturing and a supply glut in China, Sharp scrambled to keep ahead of cheaper competitors. It developed ever-bigger TV displays and expanded into touch screens for smartphones and tablet computers. But rivals matched it more quickly than executives had anticipated, said Mr. Nakata, who left Sharp a decade ago and is now a professor at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University in Japan.\\xa0Sharp had found a rescuer in a Taiwanese company called Foxconn, which makes gadgets for Apple and others and was offering a $5.5 billion lifeline. But Sharp unexpectedly told its would-be rescuer last week that it could be liable for close to $3 billion in potential costs, according to a person with knowledge of the talks. Foxconn is still examining the sudden disclosure, and it isn’t clear whether the Taiwanese company will complete the deal.\\n\\n\\nMessaging Startup Slack Seeks Up to $4 Billion Valuation in an \\'Up\\' Funding Round:\\xa0The company is said to be in talks to raise $150 million to $300 million in financing. Slack Technologies Inc., which runs a messaging service for businesses, is seeking an investment that would value the company at $3.5 billion to $4 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. Slack is looking to raise $150 million to $300 million as part of the round, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the terms aren\\'t finalized. The talks are ongoing, and a lead investor has not been selected, the people said. If successful, Slack\\'s fundraising round would stand out. Venture investment in startups dropped about 30 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the previous one, according to research firm CB Insights. Also during the last three months of the year, 26 percent of mature startups raised money at lower valuations than in earlier rounds, according to a study by law firm Fenwick & West LLP. Even as startup fundraising shows signs of slowing and valuations begin to tumble, a few companies are pushing ahead. Slack said it raised $160 million less than a year ago, valuing the company at $2.8 billion. It\\'s raised more than $300 million in total and has also used its fundraising clout to create an $80 million venture fund with several of its investors to back Slack-related apps. Slack, which launched its current business about two years ago, said it has 2.3 million daily active users, up from 520,000 a year ago. The company also said it had more than $64 million in annual recurring revenue. The metric projects the value of current customers over the course of a year, and the number can differ substantially from actual revenue for fast-growing startups.\\n\\n\\nTech start-ups the new gold for China\\'s wealthy as economy slows:\\xa0More wealthy Chinese are ploughing money into technology start-ups which are increasingly seen as a safe haven as the slowing economy eases hopes of extracting returns from traditional investment such as stocks, property or gold.\\xa0While Chinese shares are being pummelled and the yuan is under pressure, these private investors are turning to businesses such as taxi-hailing company Didi Kuaidi, which saw its valuation rise 25 percent to about $20 billion in a $1 billion funding round launched last week.\\xa0This gain sharply contrasts with the 43 percent plunge in the CSI 300 index of top-listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen since June last year, underscoring the appetite for tech firms. China\\'s stock markets are the worst performing in the region, according to Thomson Reuters data.\\xa0Even some mid-sized banks, including China Merchants Bank are investing into tech ventures.\\xa0What is unique about China\\'s venture capital and private equity industry is that a good chunk of yuan fund raising comes from wealthy individual investors. This contrasts with Western markets, where institutional investors take the lion\\'s share of such placements.\\xa0A lawyer told Reuters she had recently structured several investment deals into tech companies for wealthy clients. She declined to be named, or give details of the deals due to the confidentiality of the matter.\\n\\n\\nIs Verizon Buying Yahoo? A Resounding …\\xa0Maybe. Verizon is still considering a purchase of Yahoo, but said it needs to better understand the Internet company’s assets before deciding whether to make a formal bid.\\xa0“I don’t think anybody knows what’s under the hood,” CFO Fran Shammo said at a Morgan Stanley investment conference on Tuesday.\\xa0Shammo said the company is considering all kinds of merger and acquisition options, including both purchases and divestments. He confirmed that the company is still weighing, for example, whether to hold on to or sell its data centers.\\xa0“Is it better off outside of our portfolio?” he said. “We’re looking at that.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFidelity Writes Down Value of Corporate Software Startups:\\xa0Fidelity Investments slashed the value of its holdings in several corporate software startups in January, while taking a more optimistic view of private consumer-technology companies such as Snapchat and Uber.\\xa0The value of Dropbox Inc. shares were marked down 10 percent in January from the price in December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from public filings. Fidelity also wrote down its stake in the cloud storage company last year. The fund manager periodically readjusts the value of its private stock holdings, based on a variety of factors, and is required to disclose the new values publicly.\\xa0CloudFlare Inc., maker of Web performance and cybersecurity software for businesses, took a much bigger hit. Fidelity marked down its holdings in that company by 31 percent. CloudFlare Chief Executive Officer Matthew Prince blamed the writedown on market conditions and said Fidelity had marked up the company\\'s value twice before. \"When the market recovers, we\\'ll recover with it,\" he said. Although Prince wasn\\'t happy about the decrease, he saw it as a \"baby step\" toward becoming a public company, when a company\\'s stock price fluctuates constantly.\\xa0DocuSign Inc., which makes electronic signature technology for contracts and other documents, and Nutanix Inc., a maker of software and hardware for data centers that filed to go public in December, were each written down by 17 percent. Fidelity also marked down Twilio Inc., which makes tools for app developers, by 13 percent.\\xa0Consumer apps fared better in January. Fidelity did not change its valuations for Airbnb Inc., Pinterest Inc., Snapchat, and Uber, despite a rough month in the public markets and signs of a slowdown in private investments. About a quarter of mature startups raised money at lower valuations in the fourth quarter than in previous rounds, according to a study by Silicon Valley law firm Fenwick & West LLP. More than half of those later-stage deals included terms that guarantee new investors get their money back before other shareholders.\\xa0Fidelity\\'s markdowns of corporate software startups came after a brutal month for their publicly traded peers. IBM and VMware Inc. reported disappointing earnings forecasts in January. Many technology companies said they expected a tough IT climate for 2016 and often cited a deteriorating macroeconomic environment as a factor.\\xa0The Standard and Poor\\'s 500 Index was down 5.1 percent in January, but several enterprise software companies were well below that. Box Inc., a Dropbox rival, plunged 23 percent. Workday Inc. fell 21 percent. Salesforce.com Inc. dropped 13 percent.\\xa0Despite the dismal climate, Fidelity didn\\'t write down every enterprise startup. For example, the fund manager kept the value of its shares in Cloudera Inc., a Silicon Valley Big Data company, unchanged in January.\\n\\n\\nFacebook executive jailed in Brazil as court seeks WhatsApp data:\\xa0Brazilian police arrested a senior Facebook Inc executive on Tuesday as a dispute escalated over a court\\'s demand that the company provide data from its WhatsApp messaging service to help in a secretive drug-trafficking investigation.\\xa0Court officials in Sergipe state confirmed that a judge had ordered the jailing of Facebook Vice President for Latin America Diego Dzodan. Federal police in Sao Paulo state said he was being held there for questioning.\\xa0Law enforcement officials withheld further information about the nature of their request to the messaging service that Facebook Inc acquired in 2014, saying that doing so could compromise an ongoing criminal investigation.\\xa0The arrest, which Facebook called an \"extreme and disproportionate measure,\" came as social media and Internet companies face mounting pressure from governments around the world to help them eavesdrop on users and filter content.\\xa0Arrests of officials from social media companies are extremely rare, though not unprecedented, because the companies typically comply with local court orders, especially from countries where they have branch offices.\\n\\n\\nSurveyMonkey to Lay Off 100 and Retool Business Product:\\xa0Cloud-based polling service SurveyMonkey informed employees today that it is letting go of about 100 people in a plan to retool its product aimed at businesses, which is not living up to expectations. The layoffs were to be disclosed at an internal meeting this afternoon. The cuts amount to about 13 percent of SurveyMonkey’s workforce of about 750. The cuts were made primarily among the sales team devoted to SurveyMonkey for Business. \\xa0The move comes six weeks into the tenure of SurveyMonkey’s new CEO Zander Lurie, the former GoPro exec who joined in January. In an interview, Lurie told Re/code that SurveyMonkey, which is privately held, is on track to post $200 million in 2016 with an Ebitda profit margin of north of 30 percent.\\n\\n\\nLinkedIn Is Now Allowing Marketers to Target Ads at Specific Companies:\\xa0On Tuesday, the company announced that marketers running native ads through Sponsored Updates or Sponsored InMail campaigns can target user profiles based on a list of companies they want to target specific products or other sales to.\\xa0The feature, which is appropriately named LinkedIn Account Targeting, allows marketers to provide a list of as many as 30,000 companies they want to target in a campaign. LinkedIn then checks to see which of those are among the 8 million companies on the platform before targeting those pages—and profiles of people at those companies based on criteria such as job duties and seniority.\\xa0According to Lindsey Edwards, senior product manager for LinkedIn Marketing Solutions, LinkedIn has traditionally focused on bringing profile data—job titles, seniority level, skills and groups—to advertisers and marketers for targeting purposes. But this is the first time LinkedIn is letting companies bring their own data to the platform. Previously, marketers could only target up to 100 companies, mostly only by manual selection. In some ways, LinkedIn is bucking the trend by opening its \"walled garden\" (a commonly used metaphor for how companies like Google and Facebook withhold data from marketers using their closed ad buying systems). Edwards said marketers can start \"digging in\" by bringing their own data.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSouq, Online Retailer in Middle East, Gets a $275 Million Boost:\\xa0\\xa0Souq.com, an online retailer based in the United Arab Emirates, said on Monday that it had raised $275 million from international investors. It was a vote of confidence for digital commerce in the Middle East, which has made little headway compared with elsewhere. Souq, the largest e-commerce company in the Middle East, was founded in 2005 on an eBay-like online auction model, but it subsequently evolved into more of an Amazon-style set-price retailer. It has been a rare success story in a region where online businesses face logistical problems, political challenges, stifling bureaucracy and regulations that vary greatly from country to country. Souq’s latest round of funding included money from the New York-based investment firm Tiger Global Management, as well as from Standard Chartered Private Equity and the International Finance Corporation, which is an arm of the World Bank. Souq, which means market in Arabic, did not provide details on what the funding round meant for its overall valuation, and it has not released details on its annual sales or profit. The $275 million funding round was, however, the largest ever disclosed by a technology start-up in the Middle East and North Africa, according to Wamda, a research firm based in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates. Even after multiple fund-raising rounds, the Jabbar Internet Group — which sold Maktoob, a news site, to Yahoo for more than $150 million in 2009 — still holds a majority stake. Souq, now the largest online retailer in the Arab world, ships hundreds of thousands of products across the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It also has operations in Egypt.\\n\\n\\nFor the first time, Google’s self-driving car takes some blame for a crash:\\xa0A Google self-driving car sideswiped a bus this month, the first blemish on the otherwise spotless driving record of the company’s vehicles. Google’s 53 vehicles have driven more than 1.4 million miles autonomously and been in 17 crashes, but never been at fault before. The crash took place at 3:20 p.m. Feb. 14, about three miles from Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. Google’s car was attempting to make a right-hand turn on red, and moved to the right side of a wide lane on El Camino Real to pass traffic stopped at the light. But as Google’s car neared the intersection of Castro Street, its path was blocked by sandbags around a storm drain, according to a report Google filed with the California DMV. Google’s car tried to go around the sandbags by cutting into the line of vehicles on the left side of the lane. Instead, it struck a metal piece connecting the two halves of an accordion-style bus, according to a Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority spokeswoman. Google said its car was going less than 2 mph and the bus was moving at 15 mph. Both parties said there were no injuries and described the crash as minor. The 15 passengers on the bus were transferred to another bus following the accident. Google characterized the crash as a misunderstanding and a learning experience, saying its cars will learn that large vehicles are less likely to yield than other types of vehicles.\\n\\n\\nThis Water Pitcher Orders New Filters From Amazon Using Wi-Fi. It Could Be the Future of Shopping.\\xa0The future often seems silly in the present. Case in point: Brita’s new “smart” water pitcher. The “device” is indeed primarily a water pitcher, designed — you know — to clean and hold water. But the pitcher, which goes on sale today on Amazon, does something else that helps explain why Brita is charging $45 for it, compared to $20 to $32 for other Brita pitchers that hold the same amount of water. It connects to the Internet and senses when a given filter has purified all the water it was meant to, after about 40 gallons. It then pings Amazon.com and automatically orders a new $5.99 filter for delivery. Call it programmatic commerce, and expect it to be around for a long time. The partnership between Brita and Amazon is part of a bigger initiative at Amazon dubbed the Dash Replenishment System. The goal is to allow products like water pitchers, computer printers and pet food dispensers automatically to order related, necessary items from Amazon without a human lifting a finger (after a one-time setup). At a higher level, it fits perfectly into Amazon’s ongoing mission to shrink the time between wanting and buying. What started with one-click purchasing has escalated to Wi-Fi connected physical buttons to order mac and cheese, reordering items by talking to the Amazon Echo speaker and now filter-summoning pitchers.\\n\\n\\nRaspberry Pi 3 Launches — 50% Faster, With Wi-Fi, Bluetooth And An Eye On IoT:\\xa0A major new Raspberry Pi microprocessor has been announced today: the Pi 3 Model B board becomes the new top-of-the-line Pi, with a 64bit 1.2GHz quad-core chipset and 1GB RAM it’s being slated to offer a 50 per cent power bump over the Pi 2. But is still priced at just $35 — the original Model B Pi price-tag, four years on from its debut. Round about this time last year the Pi Foundation launched the 900Mhz quad-core Pi 2 — which was 6x faster than the then top-of-the-Pi-line Model B+ board, and dubbed an affordable “entry-level PC”. Also priced at $35. The Foundation is touting the Pi 3 as opening up “even more possibilities for IoT and embedded projects”. Speaking to the BBC, Pi founder Eben Upton said: “This is the first Pi you can stick behind your TV and completely forget about.” “The two main things that people do with their Pi are use it as a PC replacement or use it as an embedded computer,” he added. “The Pi 3 is doubling down on both those things rather than going looking for new things to do.” The really big deal here is the inclusion of built in wireless LAN and Bluetooth. The Pi 2 had Ethernet but makers wanting the board to support wireless connectivity had to add a wi-fi or Bluetooth dongle. The Pi 3 removes the need to buy wireless add-ons, so it’s being positioned for out-of-the-box IoT development and as a powerful IoT hub that can link together multiple in-home connected devices. Back in November, the Pi Foundation launched another new board: the single core 1GHz Pi Zero delivers a lot less on the processing performance front and lacks on-board connectivity options (a wi-fi dongle can be plugged into its micro-USB port) but it costs just $5 — a price-point that’s clearly targeting makers wanting to build individual IoT/connected devices. The more powerful and well connected Pi 3 doubles down on the growth in IoT devices the Pi Zero was seeking to encourage — following on from the Pi 2, which was capable of running a version of Microsoft Windows that’s designed to support IoT apps (aka Windows 10 IoT; formerly called Windows Embedded). At a launch event today the Foundation said it has worked closely with Microsoft to ensure full compatibility between the new Pi 3 board and Windows 10 IoT.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMorgan Stanley fund marks down Flipkart stake value by 27%:\\xa0A mutual fund investor in Flipkart Ltd, India’s largest e-commerce firm, has slashed the value of its holdings by as much as 27%, the latest indication that the investor rush of the past two years into Indian startups has led to unsustainable valuations.Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Trust valued its stake in Flipkart at $58.9 million as of 31 December, down from $80.6 million in June 2015. The company reported the number late Friday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US stock markets regulator. Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Trust also cut the value of its stake in other high flying startups including file storage company Dropbox Inc. and data analytics company Palantir.Flipkart was valued at $15 billion when it received $700 million from Tiger Global Management, Qatar Investment Authority and other investors in June. That was its fourth round of fund raising in a year. Its valuation shot up roughly 5 times from $2.5-3 billion in May 2014. Morgan Stanley’s latest estimate implies that the mutual fund currently values Flipkart at $11 billion. Mint reported on 4 February that China’s Alibaba Group is in early talks to buy a stake in Flipkart and increase its holding in Flipkart rival, Snapdeal. The talks are at a very initial stage and the likelihood of a deal is a function of Flipkart’s willingness to offer a discount on its current valuation of $15 billion, Mint had reported then. There are not too many takers for India’s top e-commerce firms at their current valuations, prompting both Flipkart and Snapdeal \\xa0to approach Alibaba Group for cash. Early last year, Flipkart set a target of generating annualized gross merchandise value (GMV) of $8 billion by December. However, the company’s current average monthly annualized GMV is roughly $5 billion, Mint reported on 17 February. This number, which includes sales at Flipkart’s unit Myntra, indicates Flipkart missed its internal sales target.\\n\\n\\nIn ‘Strategic Refocus,’ Troubled Zenefits Lets 250 Employees Go:\\xa0Zenefits, the troubled benefits software company that three weeks ago fired its founding CEO, said today that it has laid off 250 employees, mostly in its sales recruiting organization.\\xa0In a memo to employees, CEO David Sacks said the move signals an intention to “rebuild in line with our new company values.” Zenefits, which sells employee health insurance plans alongside free software to administer those plans, was been rocked by disclosures that many of its employees are not properly licensed to sell insurance.\\xa0The job cuts amount to about 17 percent of the Zenefits workforce. The company has until recently been considered a Silicon Valley high-flyer, having raised $500 million from investors at a valuation of $4.5 billion. From an email from new CEO David Sacks: \"We are reducing our headcount by roughly 250 employees, or about 17 percent of total employees. These changes are almost entirely in the Sales organization, with about a dozen employees in Recruiting. Within the Sales organization, we are eliminating the Enterprise team (although some members will be offered other roles). We are also making a large reduction in Sales Development Representatives (SDR), the organization that prospected for the largest accounts.I want to make clear that this is a reduction in force (RIF), meaning that we are not cutting these jobs for performance reasons. We are letting go of many great people today, and it is not their fault. It is no secret that Zenefits grew too fast, stretching both our culture and our controls. This reduction enables us to refocus our strategy, rebuild in line with our new company values, and grow in a controlled way that will be strategic for our business and beneficial for our customers.\"\\n\\n\\nIHOP Is Releasing Special Snapchat Geolocation Filters, but You Have to Visit the Restaurant to Use Them - The\\xa0Geo-fencing feature is all about engagement:\\xa0IHOP today announced a Snapchat campaign that targets patrons inside its restaurants.\\xa0To push its Double-Dipped French Toast, the all-day breakfast brand is essentially using the same custom geo-filters Snapchat introduced to the masses on Monday. But it\\'s working directly with the Los Angeles social app to serve the ad just to IHOP customers.\\xa0IHOP and Snapchat developed what they are calling \"chain geo-filters,\" location-based dynamic art that can be added to photo and video snaps.

      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\nBaidu Shares Rise 14% On Revenue Beat:\\xa0Baidu Inc. posted revenue that topped analysts’ estimates as the Chinese Internet search provider’s investments in mobile begin to bear fruit and attract advertising. Sales rose 33 percent to 18.7 billion yuan ($2.9 billion) in the December quarter from a year earlier, the Beijing-based company said in a statement. That beat the average analyst estimate of 18.5 billion yuan, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Mobile revenue made up 56 percent of total sales in the quarter, up from 42 percent a year earlier, Baidu said.\\xa0The company’s dominance in search as more users shift to using mobile devices is helping offset the impact of a Chinese economy growing at its slowest pace in 25 years. Chairman Robin Li is also investing in services such as home delivery and online video to drive growth beyond advertising and help Baidu compete with Alibaba and Tencent. Baidu’s American depositary receipts rose as much as 14 percent to $179.90 in extended U.S. trading after the results were released. The stock has lost 16 percent this year. Investors are keeping a close eye on Baidu’s margins. Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu are now vying for supremacy in an on-demand services industry primed for growth as more people turn to their smartphones or the Web to order food, schedule beauty treatments or hire helpers. Users of such services could rise 29 percent to 400 million by next year, according to Shanghai-based IResearch.\\xa0The rising cost of competing in online services is spurring consolidation, including the combinations last year of fashion sites Meilishuo and Mogujie, travel-site operators Ctrip and Qunar, and group-buying startups Meituan.com and Dianping.com.\\xa0Baidu has had to keep spending on its video-streaming service IQiyi and main online commerce site Nuomi to keep pace with Alibaba’s and Tencent’s expanding rival platforms. Chairman Li and another executive this month offered to buy Baidu’s entire 80.5 percent stake in the IQiyi business, a deal that will shore up the search giant’s margins while setting up a potential initial public offering for the unit.\\xa0“These bold steps help to reveal its core operating margins and the earning power of its monopoly-like search engine business,” HSBC Securities analysts led by Chi Tsang wrote in a report. Selling IQiyi could expand Baidu’s operating margins to 26 percent this year from 20 percent, even while unabated spending on on-demand services erases about 30 percentage points of profitability, they estimated.\\n\\n\\nAnonmyous Flyers Posted At Palantir\\'s Campus Warn Employees That Stock Is Worthless - Flyers Are False:\\xa0Employees of data-analysis company Palantir \\xa0may have seen flyers posted on lampposts around their Silicon Valley offices this week featuring a disemboweled unicorn with rainbow blood streaming from its midsection. The posting, dated Feb. 23, warned: \"Palantir workers: your common shares are worth $0.00.\"\\xa0Palantir staff can relax a bit. The terms of recent fundraising rounds don\\'t contain many of the provisions that can crush the value of common shares held by employees.Fundraising talks last year valued Palantir at $20 billion, people with knowledge of the matter said in June.\\xa0While Palantir shares are trading lower on secondary markets than they were last year, the same can be said for many stocks, private and public, thanks to a global economic slowdown. Palantir common stock fetches $8.50 to $10 a share on secondary markets before fees, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing private share sales. That\\'s a long way from zero. Palantir declined to comment. Several flyers have already been removed, according to Quartz. Someone posting on an online community forum under the pseudonym Palantir_Watcher claimed responsibility for creating the handouts. The person didn\\'t respond to a request for comment. However, the guerilla campaign tapped into an undercurrent of uncertainty and fear about what private companies in Silicon Valley are worth after a wave ofwritedowns and cost-cutting at startups.\\xa0Venture capitalists and other institutional investors typically hold preferred shares. They are worth more on secondary markets than common stock, which is what is given to employees, often representing a significant portion of their compensation. However, Palantir hasn\\'t given newer investors the sort of preferential treatment awarded to shareholders of companies such as DocuSign Inc., Honest Co., and Stripe Inc., according to an analysis by the technology website the Information.\\xa0The proportion of funding rounds that gave senior liquidation preferences to new investors was on the rise last year among companies with valuations of at least $1 billion, according to a study by law firm Fenwick & West. That allows those new investors to cash out before common shareholders, as well as earlier investors with preferred shares. During the fourth quarter of 2015, 42 percent of deals had such provisions, compared with 15 percent in the previous two quarters. Investors were also given the right to block an initial public offering that didn\\'t meet their valuation threshold in 33 percent of deals in the fourth quarter, compared with 20 percent in the second quarter, the study said. Palantir had neither provision.\\n\\n\\nFoxConn Agrees To Buy Sharp, Then Pulls Back On Discovering New Liabilities:\\xa0Taiwan\\'s Foxconn has put its takeover of Sharp Corp on hold after discovering previously undisclosed liabilities, sources said, throwing the acquisition in doubt and sending shares of the Japanese electronics maker tumbling.\\xa0Loss-making Sharp announced on Thursday that it had agreed to be bought by Foxconn, a contract manufacturing firm formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co and major Apple Inc supplier. Just hours later, Foxconn said it would not sign the deal until it had clarified some \"new material information\" from Sharp. It did not elaborate.\\xa0Shares slid 14 percent on Friday morning, adding to a drop of 14 percent a day earlier as the planned share dilution looked larger than expected.\\xa0\"That puts the entire deal in jeopardy,\" Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal said in a note to clients. \"This is especially so given the dramatic back and forth that happened between Sharp and Foxconn in 2012, when Foxconn agreed to acquire a stake in Sharp but then later walked away.\"\\xa0Two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said the Japanese group had contingent liabilities that amounted to \"hundreds of billions of yen.\"\\xa0The sources did not elaborate on the nature of the liabilities or the exact amount. Reuters has not seen any documents regarding the new information.\\xa0The 11th hour delay jeopardizes a deal that would have marked the conclusion to five years of courting by Foxconn founder and billionaire Terry Gou and the opening up of Japan\\'s insular tech sector to foreign investment.\\xa0The loss-making display maker said on Thursday that it would issue around $4.4 billion worth of new shares to give Foxconn a two-thirds stake. Foxconn\\'s investment is set to total more than 650 billion yen ($5.8 billion), a separate source familiar with the matter said.\\xa0If a deal does go through, it would boost Foxconn\\'s position as Apple\\'s main contract manufacturer and enable Sharp to start mass-producing organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens by 2018, around the time Apple is expected to adopt the next-generation displays for its iPhones.\\xa0But efforts to patch up the deal could be impeded by lingering distrust over the collapse of the 2012 deal to form capital ties. That distrust was one reason Sharp officials, until recently, preferred a lower offer by the state-backed Innovation Network Corp of Japan.\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft will pay about $400 million for software developer tools startup Xamarin, according to people with knowledge of the agreement.The deal was announced Wednesday by both companies without terms. Xamarin had sales of about $30 million for 2015 and expects to approximately double that in the current year, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the details of the purchase aren’t public. Microsoft Is Buying a Company That Is Key to Its Cross-Platform Future: Microsoft today says it\\'s acquiring mobile app development startup Xamarin for an undisclosed sum, giving the company a tool for building mobile apps that can work across iOS, Android, and Windows phones. Xamarin, which has 15,000 customers including large brand names like Coca-Cola and JetBlue, allows developers to code in a single programming language while designing an app to look native to each platform. Xamarin also offers a way for developers to test those apps using thousands of cloud-hosted devices. One of the four-year-old startup\\'s main products relies on Microsoft\\'s Visual Studio software, so this acquisition is a natural pairing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAirbnb Admits It Removed 1,500 Listings in New York Before Releasing Data to Regulators:\\xa0Before Airbnb Inc. shared data on its business in New York City, the home-rental website removed about 1,500 listings controlled by full-time landlords. The company disclosed the removals in a letter to New York state legislators on Wednesday as it faces criticism over becoming a platform for unregulated hotels. \\xa0Airbnb said it kicked off 622 hosts as part of the effort in November. The cuts helped portray a rosier picture of its New York City operations in the data released in December. The company had not outlined the extent of its removals when it initially presented the data publicly. The deleted listings accounted for about 4 percent of those offered in the city. Josh Meltzer, the company\\'s head of public policy in New York, wrote in the letter to legislators that the listings \"did not reflect Airbnb\\'s vision for our community.\" Airbnb has faced questions from city officials who have said real-estate developers are using Airbnb to rent out homes instead of selling them to permanent residents. The practice risks driving up housing prices. Airbnb defeated a proposal in San Francisco last year that would have restricted the company\\'s business in its hometown. Airbnb spent $8 million to fight the effort. \"In New York City, where housing prices and availability are a critical issue, we want to work with our community and policymakers to help prevent short-term rentals from impacting the availability and cost of permanent housing for city residents,\" Meltzer wrote in the letter. \"While home sharing has been around for centuries, our people-to-people home sharing platform is new. And Airbnb is a young company. We have learned that a one-size fits all approach to cities will not work.\" Along with the letter to New York lawmakers, Airbnb released updated data on its operations in the city. Of hosts renting their entire homes in New York City, 38 percent of revenue came from those listing two or more homes on the website. Hosts with six or more homes on Airbnb generated 6 percent of revenue.\\n\\n\\nSalesforce quarterly revenue beats Wall St expectations:\\xa0Salesforce.com Inc reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue and raised its full-year revenue forecast, saying customers were stepping up purchases of its web-based sales and marketing software despite economic uncertainty.Shares of the world\\'s largest maker of online sales software rose 7.2 percent to $67 in after-hours trading.The company raised its full-year revenue forecast to $8.08 billion-$8.12 billion, from $8.0 billon-$8.1 billion, and said forecast adjusted profit of 99 cents to $1.01 per share.\\xa0Revenue rose 25.3 percent to $1.81 billion, above analysts\\' estimate of $1.79 billion.\\xa0In the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31, revenue from sales cloud - a suite of software that allows companies to track leads, forecast and collaborate around sales opportunities - rose 12.3 percent to $708.9 million.\\xa0The net loss narrowed to $25.5 million, or 4 cents per share, from $65.8 million, or 10 cents per share, a year earlier.\\n\\n\\nHP Inc says to accelerate job cuts by 2016:\\xa0HP Inc said it was accelerating its restructuring program and now expects about 3,000 people will exit by the end of fiscal 2016 instead of over three years as it announced in September.\\xa0Then, Hewlett-Packard Co had said it expected to cut about 33,300 jobs over three years, of which up to 3,300 were to be cut in HP Inc. It said then that 1,200 people would leave the company by the end of 2016.\\xa0The restructuring will result in charges and associated cash payments of about $300 million in the current year, the company said.\\xa0\"This move is basically HP Inc embracing the tough pricing environment and shifting their focus to building their portfolio,\" says Shannon Cross, an analyst for Cross Research.\\xa0HP Inc (HPQ.N), which houses former Hewlett-Packard Co\\'s legacy hardware business, reported a near 12 percent drop in quarterly revenue, as it struggles with weak demand for PCs and printers.\\xa0Revenue in the company\\'s personal systems business fell 13 percent in the first quarter ended Jan. 31, while it declined 17 percent in its printing division from a year earlier.\\xa0PC sales have been falling sharply worldwide, and the launch of Windows 10 has so far failed to rekindle demand.\\xa0Printer demand has been hurt as corporate customers cut printing costs and consumers shift to mobile devices.\\n\\n\\nGoogle Fiber Is Finally Coming to San Francisco:\\xa0Google Fiber is coming to its own backyard. Well, in moderation. On Wednesday, the high-speed broadband and cable business, announced that it will start servicing “some” apartments, condos and affordable housing units in San Francisco, the urban hub north of its Silicon Valley headquarters. It’s not saying how many connections, when they’ll come or how much they’ll cost.But it is definitely coming, unlike other cities where Fiber has said that it is “exploring” an arrival. That makes San Francisco among the largest metropolitan areas for Fiber, which has, so far, kept to smaller cities clamoring for its service (and where it can more quickly gain broadband market share).It’s a symbolic entry — landing near Silicon Valley — as well as a commercial one: The city is full of tech companies and techies that have also clamored for super fast Internet.Comcast* and AT&T, two of Fiber’s chief competitors, have both announced intentions to bring gigabit Internet to the city. While Fiber has primarily focused on residential lines, it could expand into enterprise services, something Comcast has made a push for.Google is accelerating its enterprise business, which includes a team dedicated to getting startups on Google services. It’s not clear if that includes Fiber, which is housed under the Access subsidiary of Google’s Alphabet.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWow! Facebook’s New Reactions Are Here, but Still No Dislike Button.\\xa0Facebook has been testing alternatives to the company’s now-famous “Like” button for a few months, and it’s ready to bring those alternatives to the masses. The company is rolling out new reactions like “wow,” “sad” and “haha” to U.S. users beginning Wednesday and the rest of the world shortly after, according to Tom Alison, engineering director for News Feed. It started testing these responses in countries like Spain and Ireland last fall, and while the company said at the time that it was open to adding more emotions it looks like it stuck with the same six it started with. Getting to those six was actually a lengthy process, said Alison. The company has been working on reactions for a year, and crafted the new options based on data about which stickers and user comments were most popular on Facebook. You’ll quickly notice what’s not included in the new list of reactions: A dislike button. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg initially said Facebook was building one, but it turns out that wasn’t actually the case. (Angry!) “I think … ‘anger’ and ‘sad’ actually covered a lot of what we saw people trying to convey,” Alison explained. Why change the “Like” feature at all? Engagement. You may not feel comfortable “Liking” a sad update in your feed, so Facebook wants to give you other options. Alison said it’s “a little early” to tell if engagement increased in countries where Facebook has been testing the new reactions, which probably means it hasn’t. (Facebook would likely broadcast it if engagement were up.) The new feature will be available on iOS and Android phones beginning Wednesday as part of a free app update.\\n\\n\\nUber China Rival Didi Kuaidi Raising $1 Billion at Valuation of More Than $20 Billion:\\xa0Didi Kuaidi, the biggest ride-hailing company in China, has received at least $1 billion in commitments for a new fundraising round, according to a person familiar with the matter. Once the financing closes, it would value the Uber rival at more than $20 billion, said the person, who asked not to be named because the terms aren\\'t final. The round is oversubscribed, and the company is still negotiating terms with investors, the person said. Didi Kuaidi declined to comment. Didi Kuaidi is spending heavily on adding new drivers and offering competitive fare prices as it aims to stay ahead of Uber Technologies Inc. in China. Uber spent more than $1 billion in the country last year and plans to spend a comparable amount in 2016. In the first three quarters of 2015, Uber lost $1.7 billion, much of that going toward expansion in Asia, Bloomberg Businessweek reported in January. Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick said last week that the company is profitable in the U.S., according to Canadian technology blog BetaKit. It\\'s unclear how the metric was calculated. Didi Kuaidi raised $3 billion last year at a $16.5 billion valuation. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the Chinese company\\'s latest fundraising round. To take on Uber, Didi Kuaidi has formed an international coalition with the likes of Lyft Inc. in the U.S. and Ola in India. Uber was last valued by investors at $62.5 billion, and the company has raised more than $10 billion in the five years since it started picking up passengers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEuropean Tech Scene Begins to Feel Silicon Valley’s Woes:\\xa0At the offices of Deliveroo, a food delivery start-up with headquarters in an upmarket neighborhood here, signs of activity are everywhere. The communal kitchen hums with 20-something developers. A gold-painted scooter, which the co-founder William Shu once used to make deliveries, stands in the center of the office as people bustle about.\\xa0The frenetic pace belies a more cautious approach that Mr. Shu, 36, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker, has recently started taking at the start-up.Over the last year, Mr. Shu has urged colleagues to be more circumspect with growth plans, forgoing rapid expansion in competitive markets like the United States to focus on places where Deliveroo already has a loyal following. And while the start-up has raised almost $200 million, employs roughly 400 people worldwide and operates in 12 countries, Mr. Shu says profitability — and not just aggressive growth to beat rivals to new markets — is increasingly important as the company moves beyond its British roots. The focus at Deliveroo is symptomatic of a change across many European start-ups. Just as in Silicon Valley, where a number of privately held tech companies have been stung by lower valuations and investor questions about their sustainability, that same unease has now reached Europe’s tech community, in a sign that a move away from soaring boom times in start-ups is going global.\\xa0Driving the pullback are some of the same forces that have caused a change in Silicon Valley’s start-up scene. Tech stocks are gyrating because of fears of a global economic slowdown — exacerbated in Europe by the region’s migrant crisis and persistent financial problems. Valuations of some start-ups worldwide got ahead of themselves. As a result, venture capitalists in Europe and farther afield are becoming more cautious about funding local start-ups that do not have proven business ideas.\\xa0“When Silicon Valley sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold,” said Fred Destin, a partner at the London office of Accel Partners, a venture capital firm. “It’s only a matter of time before Europe faces the same issues that we’re seeing on the West Coast.”\\xa0In Europe, that is leading to situations like that of Powa Technologies. Last week , Powa, an e-commerce company based in London, entered into administration, a form of bankruptcy. The start-up had raised $175 million since 2013 but had failed to win enough customers for its mobile shopping technology. Deloitte, which is overseeing the sale of the company’s assets, says it is now working to find buyers for the business.\\xa0Truecaller, a Swedish start-up that had raised around $80 million for its caller ID smartphone application, recently laid off about 20 percent of its staff. A company spokesman declined to comment on the layoffs and said Truecaller remained committed to its business. And SwiftKey, a popular predictive typing smartphone application used by more than 300 million people worldwide, was bought by Microsoft this month for a reported $250 million, which was significantly less than what many of SwiftKey’s investors had expected.\\xa0“You can already see more hesitance and lower valuations,” Christian Reber, founder of 6Wunderkinder, a German start-up bought by Microsoft last year, said in an email. “The market correction will continue, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing.”\\n\\n\\nMasterCard will let you to take a selfie to complete purchases:\\xa0MasterCard wants to use your face to help fend off fraudsters. Using a new system called MasterCard Identity Check -- or, colloquially, \"selfie pay\" -- the credit card company will use biometric methods like face recognition and fingerprint scans to better secure online shopping.\\xa0Right now, Mastercard offers a feature that financial institutions can enable that lets customers set up a password for online payments to help prevent fraud. The new system will use the same principle, but instead of relying on a password that could be forgotten or stolen, it uses your face or fingerprint.\\xa0Consumers will go through all the normal steps of filling out credit card information when making an online purchase, but this feature adds another step: The website will send a notification through an app on customers\\' smartphones that asks them to verify their identity. This can be done either through a fingerprint scan or by using the phone\\'s camera to take a brief, selfie-like, video. When taking the \"selfie,\" the user will have to blink to prove that it\\'s a live person and not just an old photo being used to spoof the system.\\n\\n\\n\\nLenovo aims at mature markets with new \\'augmented reality\\' phone:\\xa0China\\'s Lenovo Group is ready to break into mature markets this summer with the launch of its new smartphone which sports \\'augmented reality\\' features developed under Google\\'s Tango project, its chief executive said on Tuesday.\\xa0The device, which was announced at the 2016 CES consumer electronics show in Las Vegas in January, will launch in July, Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing said in an interview at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.\\xa0Declining to give additional information he said that the phone will include Google\\'s Project Tango technology and more.\\xa0Project Tango combines 3D motion tracking with depth sensors to give a mobile device the ability to know where it is and how it moves through an area, creating the potential to use augmented reality features on the phone.\\xa0Augmented reality software then overlays text or graphics on the real-life image. It differs from virtual reality, which seeks to simulate real-world views.\\n\\n\\nTech IPO Freeze Is Sign of Investor Reality Check:\\xa0The tech IPO market is frozen. Storage vendor Nutanix is further proof. It\\'s been over three months since Square and Match Group debuted, and not a single software or Internet company has followed. Seven of the past 10 technology companies to go public are trading below their offer price, and four are down by at least 20 percent, according to FactSet.\\xa0Nutanix, which filed its IPO prospectus in December, is holding off on selling shares until the stock market volatility wanes, said sources familiar with the matter. The developer of data center technology that wraps together storage, servers and virtualization was set to go public in late January, but has been advised by its bankers to wait for the market to calm, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. No other high-profile tech companies are publicly on file. Last month, online lender Elevate Credit delayed its IPO due to market conditions, as January marked the worst month for the Nasdaq since 2010. The index is still down 8.5 percent to start the year even after rallying over the past week. For Silicon Valley\\'s financiers, this is all troubling. Big IPOs are their lifeblood. That\\'s how venture investors make outsized profits and justify the billions of dollars they pour annually into start-ups that ultimately go bust or fail to generate returns.\\xa0Last year should have been a banner year for IPOs. The Nasdaq topped 5,000 for the first time since 2000, and rose for the fourth consecutive year. Investors expressed appetite for risk, bidding up Amazon.comand Netflix, the year\\'s two best large-cap performers.\\xa0Yet, tech companies went public at the slowest pace since 2009. Instead of IPOs, the highest growth companies were raising mega-rounds of cash in the private market at valuations and revenue multiples that exceeded what public investors were paying. Hedge funds and private equity firms distorted the IPO cycle, putting piles of cash into companies but without rewarding early investors and employees the way public offerings do.\\xa0Late-stage private financing almost doubled from $8.9 billion in 2013 to $16 billion last year, according to the National Venture Capital Association, with companies including Uber, Airbnb, SpaceX and SoFi each reeling in at least $1 billion. That could mean a painfully dilutive private investment round, selling the business at a loss to some investors or going public at a price below what earlier investors paid.\\xa0\"People just have to get real,\" said Golden, a managing partner at Revolution Ventures in San Francisco and former director of JPMorgan\\'s technology investment banking practice. \"When markets are speaking, we may not like what they\\'re saying but we have to listen.\"\\n\\n\\nEtsy Shares Spike 13% As It Reports Strong Revenue In Fourth Quarter:\\xa0Etsy didn’t have a good 2015, but it was still able to finish on the stronger side. Today the company reported its fourth-quarter results, coming in at $87.9 million in revenue and a loss of 4 cents per share. Analysts were expecting a loss of 1 cent per share on revenue of $86.5 million. Another important number to track here was the company’s gross merchandise sales (GMS), which rose 21.3% to $741.5 million from $611.5 million in the fourth quarter last year. Shares of Etsy were up as much as 13% in extended trading following the report. Still, it’s partially a recovery from the day where shares ended down around 7% before the company reported earnings. t’s also a strong finish amid the fresh 2015 IPOs, which was one of the weakest years for the IPO market since 2009. Even with the strong showing, Etsy is still trading well below its IPO price — but it is certainly not alone. The fourth quarter was an important one for Etsy — it had to show investors that it could post a strong holiday quarter and bring in new people who would buy gifts and other products on Etsy. It looks like investors were pleased by its ability to beat on revenue and bring in some new buyers and sellers. It also had to show that it could continue to bring those buyers and sellers in through despite its brand as an artisanal marketplace that is quite different from others like eBay. Etsy is also continuing to navigate a shift to more mobile sales, with mobile visits accounting for 61% of the company’s overall visits, and 44% of gross merchandise sales coming from mobile devices. This is all pretty good news for the company. In general, Etsy has not had a good year. Shortly after its IPO the stock hit around $30, but has since cratered to under $8. Today, obviously, didn’t help. To be sure, a lot of companies haven’t been having a good year due to a few things outside their control — like global economic issues and foreign exchange problems — but Etsy in particular is getting hit hard by investors.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA New Breed of Trader on Wall Street: Coders With a Ph.D.:\\xa0While traders at large investment banks watched their screens in horror, at Jane Street, a bunch of Harvard Ph.D.s wearing flip-flops, shorts and hoodies, swung into action with a wave of buy orders. By the end of the day, the E.T.F. shares had retraced their sharp falls. “It’s remarkable what they can do,” said Blair Hull, a founder of an electronic trading firm who relies on Jane Street to make a market for his recently started E.T.F. “If you look at who provides this kind of liquidity these days, it’s fewer and fewer firms.” It is not only Jane Street, of course. Cantor Fitzgerald, the Knight Capital Group and the Susquehanna International Group have all capitalized on the E.T.F. explosion. And as these firms have grown, so has the demand for a new breed of Wall Street trader — one who can build financial models and write computer code but who also has the guts to spot a market anomaly and bet big with the firm’s capital. In a word, these are not your suit-and-tie bond and stock traders of yore, riding the commuter train into Manhattan. They are, instead, the pick of the global brain crop. Here is a small sample of Jane Street’s main traders: Tao Wang (doctorate in philosophy and finance from the National University of Singapore), Min Zhu (master’s in chemistry, Columbia), Brett Harrison (master’s in computer science with a focus in artificial intelligence, Harvard) and Srihari Seshadri (bachelor’s in computer science, Carnegie Mellon). Jane Street was founded at the beginning of the previous decade, when a couple of option traders and a computer expert left Susquehanna to start their own business. Harnessing Ph.D.-toting mathematicians to the most powerful computers money can buy has become the accepted way for hedge funds and banks to get a trading edge these days, but Jane Street takes this marriage of high tech and high intellect to a new level. Writing computer code, or at the least being conversant in the firm’s program of choice, OCaml, is a requisite for all traders. Indeed, new traders must complete a monthlong OCaml boot camp before they start trading. And to the degree that the super-shy Jane Street does has have a public face, it belongs to its chief technology officer, Yaron Minsky, who givesfrequent lectures at Harvard, M.I.T. and Carnegie Mellon, promoting the firm’s ability to manage risk by developing the best software around.\\n\\nA Do-It-Yourself Revolution in Diabetes Care:\\xa0John Costik got the call at the office in 2012. It was his wife, Laura, with terrible news: Their 4-year-old son, Evan, was headed into the emergency room. His blood sugar reading was sky high, about 535 mg/dl, and doctors had discovered he had Type 1 diabetes. The first three days in the hospital were a blur during which the Costiks, engineers in Rochester, received a crash course in managing the basics of diabetes care.For starters, they were told to log their son’s numbers on paper forms. It was their first hint that diabetes management did not occupy a place on technology’s bleeding edge. The methods for guesstimating carbohydrate intake also seemed imprecise, Mr. Costik found, and the process generated a lot of wasted data.“The last thing you want to do is find some form and fill it out,” he said. “You’re really just emotionally trying to cope with it, and that data in that book isn’t necessarily useful to the people with diabetes.” Several months later, Mr. Costik fitted his son with a Dexcom G4 continuous glucose monitor. A hair-thin sensor under Evan’s skin recorded an exact blood sugar reading at five-minute intervals, 24 hours a day.But all that data left with Evan every morning when he headed off to day care. Mr. Costik wanted something better: continuous access to his son’s glucose readings.So he examined the device’s software code and wrote a simple program that transmitted the monitoring data to an online spreadsheet he could view on a Web browser, Android mobile phone or, eventually, his Pebble smartwatch. Now, as consumer gadgets weave themselves ever more tightly into everyday life, patients and their families are finding homespun solutions to problems medical-device manufacturers originally did not address. Industry executives say the pace of user-driven innovation was one reason the Food and Drug Administration recently reclassified remote glucose-monitoring devices, hastening approval for new models by big companies like Dexcom and Medtronics. James Wedding, a civil engineer who lives outside Dallas, saw Mr. Costik’s Twitter post and used his code to set up a remote monitor system for his daughter, Carson, who is now 12. Lane Desborough, an engineer in California, got in touch with Mr. Costik after seeing his tweet, ultimately creating an open-source system based in part on Mr. Costik’s code. It allows anyone to hack existing glucose monitors so they transmit readings to the cloud, where they can be read by patients and caregivers.Mr. Desborough called the project Nightscout. The Nightscout group onFacebook, known as CGM in the Cloud, provides free tech support for users trying to improve on monitoring devices.About two dozen users have even started a project called Open APS, in which they are pairing insulin pumps with glucose monitors in an effort to create an open-source artificial pancreas system. These wearable devices, which automate insulin delivery, are being tested in academic settings, but these early adopters are not waiting for the results of those continuing clinical trials.Mr. Costik now works at the Center for Clinical Innovation at the University of Rochester, where he works to improve management options for all patients; Mr. Desborough is now the chief engineer at Bigfoot Biomedical, a start-up in Palo Alto, Calif., that plans to create an artificial pancreas.\\n\\n\\nFitbit Forecasts Miss Estimates on Global Rollout of New Devices:\\xa0Fitbit\\'s current-quarter profit forecast missed Wall Street estimates by a wide margin, as the wearable fitness device maker aggressively invests in new products, sending its shares down more than 16 percent in after-hours trading. The lackluster guidance overshadowed the company\\'s comfortable quarterly revenue and profit beat in the holiday shopping season. Fitbit has been diversifying its portfolio of colorful wristbands and clippable devices that track calories, sleeping patterns and heart rate, to better compete with rivals as well as to tap new markets and demographies.The company last month unveiled its $200 smartwatch, Blaze, to mixed reviews. Earlier this month, Fitbit announced a new wristband, Alta, to appeal to the more fashion-conscious customer. \\xa0Fitbit\\'s net income attributable to common stockholders rose to $64.2 million, or 26 cents per share, in the quarter, from $11.9 million, or 19 cents per share, a year earlier.On an adjusted basis, the company earned 35 cents per share. Revenue nearly doubled to $711.6 million from $370.2 million.Analysts on average had expected a profit of 25 cents and revenue of $647.8 million. Fitbit\\'s revenue forecast of $2.4 billion-$2.5 billion and adjusted profit of $1.08-$1.20 per share for 2016 was largely in line with expectations.Shares of the San Francisco-based company were down 15 percent at $14.04 in after-hours trading on Monday after closing up 5.9 percent.The stock, which has lost nearly 70 percent of its value since hitting a high in August, has been trading below the June IPO price of $20 all this month.\\n\\n\\nAmazon Raises Minimum Order Size as It Seeks More Prime Buyers:\\xa0Amazon.com Inc. is increasing the minimum order size for free shipping to $49 from $35, a step that could encourage more consumers to sign up for Prime, the online retailer’s annual service that includes two-day deliveries. The benefit of getting more people to sign up for Prime services -- for $99 a year -- is that they tend to shop more frequently and spend more money, while access to other perks such as online movies, music and other content helps to keep customers within Amazon’s shopping ecosystem. By encouraging non-Prime customers to spend more on a single order, Seattle-based Amazon is also aiming to reduce costs while boosting profits on each sale. The new threshold follows a 33 percent jump in fulfillment costs -- warehousing, packaging and shipping -- in the fourth quarter, which outpaced a 15 percent increase in product sales. Monday’s price increase is the first since 2013, when Amazon raised the threshold to $35 from $25. Amazon’s new minimum order size for free shipping brings it in line with Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s online store, which has a threshold of $50, or free pickup in stores. Target Corp. has a $25 minimum, while it’s $35 at startup Jet.com Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNew Chinese Rules on Foreign Firms’ Online Content:\\xa0China is taking another step to restrict what can be posted on the Internet in its country by issuing new rules barring foreign companies or their affiliates from engaging in publishing online content there without government approval. The rules, which were jointly released this week by the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said that beginning March 10, foreign companies or foreign joint ventures will be restricted from disseminating a wide range of content online, including text, maps, games, animation, audio and video. The rules also apply to digitized books, art, literature and science. The new regulations would allow foreign-owned companies to cooperate with a Chinese partner to publish content on the Web in China, but they must get government approval. China already has some of the world’s most restrictive policies on the dissemination of information. Chinese TV and the news media are censored; the government has censors monitoring popular social media platforms, like WeChat; and American Internet giants, like Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, have been blocked in China for years. One key question is the impact such regulations would have on companies like Apple and Microsoft, which run online platforms in China that provide services and sometimes content. For example, Apple’s Chinese App Store offers games and other apps in the country while Microsoft has a joint venture through which it provides a cloud version of Windows and Office software. Internet companies, like Akamai and Cloud Flare, have operations that work to speed traffic to foreign websites or host them through servers in China.\\n\\n\\nApple Still Holds the Keys to Its Cloud Service, but Reluctantly:\\xa0In Silicon Valley — if not Washington — Apple is being hailed for digging in its heels on a court order requiring it to aid the Federal Bureau of Investigation in gaining access to an an iPhone used by one of the attackers in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, emphasized on Tuesday in a letter to customers that helping the F.B.I. essentially hack into one of the company’s own phones would be a dangerous precedent. What’s more, Apple said it would have to create new software to do this. But while company executives have embraced the notion that Apple is no longer able to intervene for law enforcement when investigators want access to an iPhone, it has repeatedly cooperated with court orders for access to online services like its iCloud. That may sound like hypocrisy, but to people familiar with how Apple’s products and services work, it is simply a matter of technology. ICloud is an Internet service Apple customers can use to back up information that is stored on their devices. It is helpful if your phone, tablet or computer is lost or badly damaged. And it, like other online services, is a gold mine for law enforcement — as the government spying revelations by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden showed. Every few months for the last few years, tech giants like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter have published transparency reports, which are lists of instances in which a company turned over data on users at the behest of a court order in the United States or other countries.In its most recent report, covering the first six months of 2015, Apple received nearly 11,000 requests from government agencies around the world regarding information on roughly 60,000 devices. Apple provided some data in roughly 7,100 of those requests, the report said.Apple has stated repeatedly that it would hand over data to comply with a court order when it is technically able to do so. And as that report indicates, it has. Often.But the operative phrase to understand the difference between Apple’s cooperation and its resistance is “technically able.”In the fall of 2014, with an update to its iOS software, Apple switched off its ability to retrieve data from its phones and tablets. By doing this, Apple tried to take itself out of the equation when law enforcement is looking for access to a phone. In essence, the company could no longer fulfill a request if it was technically unable to do so.ICloud is a different story. Apple encrypts that data on its servers and holds on to the key, which it uses to gain access to the data when it is required to do so by a court order.There are practical reasons for managing security in the cloud differently from on an iPhone. ICloud exists, in part, to save backups in the event that, say, you drop your phone in a swimming pool. Apple needs to have that key to get your data back for you.It is not so easy for a company to take away its ability to gain access to your information when that company’s ability to retrieve your information is the reason you are using its service.\\n\\n\\nFacebook Brings 360 Dynamic Streaming To Samsung Gear VR, Forms Social VR Team:\\xa0Zuck shocked everyone by appearing on stage for the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event for MWC 2016. He wasn’t there to push Samsung’s new phones or talk about Messenger, his time onstage was all about virtual reality. Zuckerberg revealed that Facebook (which, in case if you’ve forgotten, is the parent company of Oculus) will be bringing its dynamic streaming technology for 360 video to Gear VR (which, in case if you’ve forgotten, is powered by Oculus). This technology allows significant performance upgrades to streaming content by only playing back what’s in view of the headset at any given time rather than processing the entire 360 sphere of video at once. All of this is done by seamlessly switching between dozens of variants of each 360 video taken from multiple angles. Facebook revealed more about the technology at its Video @Scale event last month. The results speak for themselves, Facebook says their efforts have “quadrupled the resolution quality of 360 streaming video in VR by reducing the amount of required network bandwidth by 4x.” Another interesting tidbit comes from a Facebook blog post today—they’re building a social VR team to focus “entirely on exploring the future of social interaction in VR.”\\n\\n\\nUber Driver Held in Killing Spree as Police Probe Tie to Routes:\\xa0A driver for Uber may have picked up passengers in between incidents as he drove around and shot at least six people dead over the span of several hours, according to police in Kalamazoo, Michigan. While there have been other incidents of misconduct by Uber drivers, the Michigan shooting would be the first to involve a mass shooting. In order to become an Uber driver, Dalton would have undergone, and passed, a background check. Uber said it’s referring inquiries regarding the routes to police given that there is an active investigation. “We are horrified and heartbroken at the senseless violence,” Joe Sullivan, Uber’s chief security officer, said in a statement. “We have reached out to the police to help with their investigation in any way that we can.”\\xa0\\n\\n\\nYahoo launches auction process as Starboard gears up for fight:\\xa0Yahoo Inc officially launched the sale of its core business on Friday, a move seen as a positive step for frustrated investors but not enough to keep an activist hedge fund from pursuing a proxy fight against the struggling Internet company.Yahoo shares jumped after the company announced its board has formed a committee of independent directors to explore strategic alternatives, and that it has hired investment banks and a law firm to run the process. The launch of the auction process, a move activist hedge fund Starboard Value and other shareholders have pushed since late last year, showed the company was moving another step closer to selling its core business, which includes search, mail and news sites, rather than spin it off as previously planned. The move follows more than three years of effort by CEO Marissa Mayer to turn around Yahoo by focusing on mobile apps and trying to boost advertising revenue. \\xa0Yahoo had acknowledged during its earnings last month that it was open to exploring options for its core business. Despite the launch, Starboard\\'s founder Jeffrey Smith is not backing down, and will continue his pursuit of nominating a group of directors for the Yahoo board, people familiar with the matter said.\\n\\n\\nThis glove could make eating easier for those with Parkinson’s disease:\\xa0Eating can be difficult and embarrassing for those with tremors, but GyroGear thinks it has a solution for patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease or essential tremor. The start-up has created a glove that steadies a person’s hand, making it easier to complete everyday tasks such as eating. The glove’s power lies in a bronze disc on the back of the hand, which weighs about as much as a roll of nickels. It spins at up to 20,000 rotations per minute, providing a steadying force. The force of the battery-powered disc is akin to putting one’s hand in molasses. While moving is not as easy, the benefit is that much of the shaking is naturally filtered out. GyroGear is aiming to reduce tremors by 70 percent. In one lab test, the London-based researchers say, it reduced a tremor by 90 percent. GyroGear founder Faii Ong was inspired by a 103-year-old hospital patient who couldn’t eat without spilling food. While cleaning her up, the medical student at Imperial College started to brainstorm solutions. \\xa0Ong cautions that there’s still work to be done. The glove hasn’t been tested by outside parties, but they plan to publish their findings in a peer-reviewed journal by the end of the year. They also hope to begin selling the product by year’s end and are raising funds from investors. “The idea of simple, wearable devices to treat tremor and to avoid the side effects from medications or alternatively the dangers of surgery is very appealing to patients and health care providers,” said Michael S. Okun, medical director of the National Parkinson Foundation. “The GyroGlove is an interesting idea, however many of these types of devices fall short of the expectations — especially when faced with very severe and disabling tremor.” There are other efforts to use mechanical solutions to aid those with Parkinson’s disease. Lift Labs, a start-up that Google acquired in 2014, has devised a vibrating spoon and fork to counteract tremors and make eating easier. While having shown promise for mild tremors, Okun said it hasn’t proven the most effective solution for more severe cases. In the long term GyroGear is interested in adapting its glove to other uses, such as for surgeons, physical therapists, photographers or anyone seeking to keep a steady hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber is profitable in the US, but is losing $1 billion a year to compete in China:\\xa0Uber is burning through more than a billion dollars a year in China as it wages a fierce price war against local rival Didi Kuaidi, its chief executive said.\\xa0The company\\'s Chinese business boosted its valuation last month to more than $8 billion after raising more than $1 billion in its latest funding round, but the U.S. ride-hailing app is not yet profitable in mainland China because of the intense competition.\\xa0\"We\\'re profitable in the USA, but we\\'re losing over $1 billion a year in China,\" Uber CEO Travis Kalanick told Canadian technology platform Betakit. \\xa0\"We have a fierce competitor that\\'s unprofitable in every city they exist in, but they\\'re buying up market share. I wish the world wasn\\'t that way.\" \\xa0The $1 billion figure was confirmed by Uber officials in China in an email to Reuters on Thursday.\\xa0Uber and China\\'s Didi Kuaidi, backed by Chinese technology giants Tencent Holdings and Alibaba Group Holding, have both spent heavily to subsidise fares to gain market share, betting on China\\'s Internet-linked transport market becoming the world\\'s biggest.\\n\\n\\nFacebook Plans To Put Ads In Messenger:\\xa0A leaked document Facebook sent to some of its biggest advertisers reveals that Facebook will launch ads within Messenger in Q2 2016. The document, obtained by TechCrunch but kept private to protect its verified source, says businesses will be able to send ads as messages to people who previously initiated a chat thread with that company. To prepare, the document recommends that businesses get consumers to start message threads with them now so they’ll be able to send them ads when the feature launches. The document also notes that Facebook has quietly launched a URL short link fb.com/msg/ that instantly opens a chat thread with a business. Facebook confirmed the existence of the URL short link. That seems to back up the validity of the leaked document. Messenger is one of Facebook’s most popular and fastest-growing products, with 800 million monthly active users. Yet the social network has never monetized it directly before. Thankfully for users, Facebook isn’t going to let brands send ad messages to just anyone or even people who’ve liked their Pages. Only those who have voluntarily chatted with a business can be sent ads. This should somewhat limit the spam potential and annoyance. Right now, almost all messages come from one’s friends, so Facebook will likely try to preserve this high signal-to-noise ratio with limits on advertising.\\n\\n\\nSecondary Shops Flooded With Unicorn Sellers:\\xa0Until recently, shares of some of the highest-flying unicorn companies have been so hard to come by that secondary buyers have battled each other, not to mention other investors, to acquire some of the startups’ common shares. As the fortunes of billion-dollar companies like Evernote have fizzled, however, so has their shareholders’ enthusiasm. Says the cofounder of one secondary shop who asked not to be named, “We aren’t seeing huge discounts yet in the top 10 names, but people are trying to dump them. It’s not just one person calling you about a particular company. It’s four.” Says another secondary investor, who also asked not to be identified for this story, “We’re seeing an enormous uptick in inbound selling interest.” The situation is changing so quickly that several people with whom we spoke say a number of new characters are now peddling shares of so-called “A List” companies whose shares would have been beyond nearly anyone’s reach six months ago. “We’re seeing a lot of sketchy people advertising these deals,” says one insider. It didn’t used to be like this. Just a year ago, demand for unicorn stock was at an unprecedented level, as were the number of companies establishing billion-dollar valuations for themselves. Unicorn coverage became a cottage industry unto itself, with tech outlets and even data analysis firms poring over which unicorns were the best employers, which companies were positioned to become unicorns, and which venture firms were the best at spotting unicorns early on, among other angles. Alas, by late August, China’s market was in a nose-drive, and both late-and early-stage investors began applying the brakes. It wasn’t long before non-traditional venture investors like Fidelity and Blackrock were slashing the valuations of some of the startups in the portfolio. A parade of well-reported WSJ pieces about what isn’t quite right at high-flying Theranos seemed to cement what many had started to think: That many unicorns really weren’t worth what their ambitious investors had settled on. (It didn’t help when, last week, the human resources startup Zenefits asked its CEO to resign over sloppy and possibly damning business practices. Ten months ago, the company was valued at $4.5 billion by investors.) Partly, such nervousness owes to employees, some of whom are getting laid off as companies cut back on costs in order to lengthen their runway. These former staffers have to exercise their options within 90 days or else lose them, and they’re calling secondary firms for help in figuring out what to do. Some sellers are venture capital firms that thought they could exit some of their investments in 2016 and are now concluding that they can’t. (As some readers will know, the clock is always ticking on a venture fund. Most have 10 or 11 years, tops, to invest in startups and get some cash back to investors before losing the confidence of those backers.)\\n\\n\\nWhy Carriers Want to Delete WhatsApp:\\xa0Two years ago, Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at the Mobile World Congress, an annual industry gathering held in Barcelona, to reassure phone companies that Facebook is their natural ally. He’d just announced the $22 billion purchase of the WhatsApp messaging service and was touting an initiative called Internet.org, a low-bandwidth suite of basic services carriers would offer in conjunction with Facebook to get hundreds of millions of people online for the first time. He pledged to “build what is going to be a more profitable model with more subscribers for carriers.” By sticking together, the Facebook founder said, both sides could benefit handsomely.As Zuckerberg prepares to return to Barcelona for this year’s MWC on Feb. 22, phone executives say his company looks more like a competitor than a partner. Last year, WhatsApp introduced free voice calls—something Facebook already offered—and both brands have messaging apps. These so-called over-the-top services cut into mobile carriers’ voice and texting revenue because they’re offered over the Internet. Some phone companies say Facebook and its ilk are freeloaders that rely on carriers’ network infrastructure without spending any money to support it. “WhatsApp is competing with us, not only with messaging but with voice, too,” Telefónica Chief Operating Officer José María Álvarez-Pallete said in August at a telecommunications industry event in the Spanish coastal city of Santander. “The premise should be, same services, same rules.” Not all carriers are lining up against Facebook. The company has more than a dozen partnerships with phone companies from Paraguay to the Philippines. Many of them say teaming up with Facebook is beneficial, because it boosts data usage and has the potential to increase revenue. Millicom International Cellular, a carrier with more than 63 million subscribers in Africa and Latin America, has run promotions in certain markets where it offers free access to Facebook and Internet.org for a couple of months. The company reported last year that 33 percent of subscribers who take part end up upgrading to fee-paying data plans. Similarly, South Africa’s No. 3 mobile company, Cell C, offers Facebook and WhatsApp for free in certain subscription packages, because they draw new users. “If we don’t innovate around these services and drive value to our customers, we run a higher risk of being left out of the future entirely,” said Cell C Chief Executive Officer José Dos Santos in an e-mail. In the long run, say some industry analysts, WhatsApp and other alternatives shouldn’t be seen as a threat to the voice service of phone companies. The typically superior sound quality of the voice calls in the apps uses lots of data. “If carriers price their data offerings correctly, it could drive up revenues,” says John Delaney, an analyst at researcher IDC. And when people graduate to video apps like Skype, data consumption grows exponentially. Says Delaney, “What carriers resent is investing heavily and having others piggyback on their investments.”\\n\\n\\nScientists created a three-armed cyborg to play the drums like no human can:\\xa0Georgia Tech researchers have built a robotic arm that attaches to a drummer’s shoulder and plays along. This allows drummers — now equipped with three arms — to play sequences that two-armed humans can’t even attempt. “It’s a richer and more sophisticated rhythm because you can hit one more thing,” said Gil Weinberg, director of the Center for Music Technology at Georgia Tech. The robotic arm is capable of hitting a drum up to 20 times per second, a rate that’s impossible for humans. And it never needs a break. The computerized arm listens to the sound of the human playing and improvises to accompany the beat. Currently it can’t be programmed to play specific songs. The robotic arm will generally mirror the volume and speed that the human is playing. Weinberg stopped short of saying the three-armed solution is presently better than what a drummer can do with two hands. The arm, finalized last week, hasn’t been tested yet to see how it complements professional drummers. Weinberg’s next step is having drummers wear a brain-scanning headband, and see whether the robotic arm can interpret their intentions and play exactly what they desire. Since 2006, he has worked to create memorable music through artificial intelligence. In one project, Weinberg built a robotic prosthesis for a drummer who lost an arm in an accident.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZenefits Scandal Highlights Perils of Hypergrowth at Start-Ups:\\xa0Zenefits may be among the first of several cautionary tales to highlight a sobering lesson: For a start-up, growing too quickly can produce just as spectacular a failure as growing too slowly. Zenefits is a three-year-old company that makes software for small businesses. In its short life span, it has been called both the most unsexy company in tech, and one of the most promising.Its investors have argued that Zenefits, which makes money by acting as a health-insurance brokerage firm for its customers, has the potential to cut the red tape that small businesses have to battle to provide benefits for their employees.These grand promises were bolstered by Zenefits’ early growth. Its annual recurring revenue — an accounting measure preferred by subscription-based software companies — reached $1 million by the end of 2013, the year Zenefits was founded. Recurring revenue hit $20 million by late 2014, and was projected to reach $100 million by late 2015. The exponential growth was catnip to investors. The start-up raised $500 million last year at a $4 billion valuation, one of the largest financing rounds in a year of mega-fundings. At one point, Andreessen Horowitz, Silicon Valley’s pre-eminent venture firm, had invested more in Zenefits than in any other company. In total, Zenefits has raised about $581 million. Then, last week, poof. Zenefits announced that Parker Conrad, its co-founder and chief executive, had resigned. In emails to employees, David O. Sacks, the former chief operating officer and new chief executive, explained that Mr. Conrad had overseen a company that had become derelict in its culture and ethics. Zenefits has sought to paint the executive changes as a new beginning. One person close to the company said when Mr. Sacks briefed employees on Mr. Conrad’s exit last week, there were celebrations and tears of relief at the San Francisco headquarters of Zenefits. \\xa0Yet the story is more complicated than the single instance of a founder’s misdeeds. Zenefits’ recklessness seems to have been merely the worst symptom of a larger sickness that infected the company, according to investors, former employees and others who worked with the management team (and who all requested anonymity because no one in Silicon Valley wants to be seen as kicking a start-up when it’s down). \\xa0That sickness: Zenefits was a company consumed by impossible expectations. In return for fund-raising at a stratospheric value, Mr. Conrad promised the moon to investors.\\xa0Then, to reach the moon, he began to transform a tiny start-up into a mighty rocket ship — only to watch it careen out of control as it stretched to accomplish the impossible. Though many noticed trouble, neither Mr. Conrad, nor the board of directors, nor anyone else in management could afford to stop, take a breath and fix the problems. Growth was the only imperative.\\n\\n\\nCybersecurity concerns - Why US Naval Academy students are learning to sail by the stars for the first time in a decade:\\xa0batteries run out, systems get hacked, and even advanced technology can be balky. In a pinch — or in a war — sailors need something to fall back on. And stars and sextants have been working pretty well for hundreds of years. So the Naval Academy started teaching its sailors how to navigate ships by looking to the heavens again this academic year. The training was dropped altogether in 2006. “I thought that we had computers and all that for navigation,” Hogan, 20, a Charleston, S.C., native said this week during a class on the subject. But amid concerns about cyberattacks and new weapons that can shut off the electricity of a ship or a plane, the Naval Academy made celestial navigation a requirement for third-year students. “Redundancy is the best policy,” said Lt. Alex Reardon, who taught three sections of the class. Especially because, when it comes to a Navy ship on the open seas, “we’re typically alone in what we do.” That could be a major problem in the event of a cyberattack, said Salvatore Mercogliano, an assistant professor focused on naval history at Campbell University and a former merchant mariner. During World War II, the U.S. began using land-based radio beacons known as the LORAN system to help guide ships. And the space race helped further celestial navigation’s decline: The Navy sponsored the development of the first operational satellite navigation system, dubbed TRANSIT, which went into active service in 1964 — providing navigation assistance for naval submarines and surface vessels. But TRANSIT was retired in the mid-’90s after the Air Force completed the modern GPS system, which uses dozens of satellites circling the globe.\\n\\n\\nAmazon expanding deliveries by its \\'on-demand\\' drivers:\\xa0Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) is quietly inviting drivers for its new \"on-demand\" delivery service to handle its standard packages, as the online retailer known for low prices and razor-thin profit margins looks to speed up delivery times and tamp down its growing multi-billion dollar logistics bill.The move, which has not been announced publicly, is the latest sign that the world\\'s biggest e-commerce company wants to control more of its own deliveries. Media reports have said the company plans to lease its own fleet of jets, and CEO Jeff Bezos eventually wants to use drones to get packages to customers.\\xa0Amazon outlined details of its latest plan over the last few weeks in an email to contract drivers who deliver parcels for Amazon Flex, a program launched last year to handle speedy deliveries of common household goods to customers using Prime Now, a mobile app that comes with Amazon\\'s popular $99-a-year Prime membership. They are not Amazon employees.\\xa0If the gambit works, industry analysts said it could help Amazon contain its shipping costs, which grew more than 18 percent to $11.5 billion last year.\\xa0It might also create a logistics network to compete with UPS and FedEx.\\n\\n\\n\\nBlippar’s New Augmented Reality App Is Supposed to Recognize Any Object You Point It At.\\xa0Augmented reality app Blippar has been around since 2011, but until recently it focusedmostly on advertising and content for brands: Point your Blippar smartphone app at a bold “B” embossed on the pages of a magazine or a bottle of ketchup and more information would pop out on your phone’s display. But it’s safe to say that augmented reality is coming into a new phase: The contextual information being supplied is getting smarter, and people are gradually becoming more aware of the capabilities of AR and virtual reality (some are even excited to wear headsets, if you can believe it). So Blippar, in an effort to evolve along with the rest of the AR world, has just launched a new version of its smartphone app that is supposed to recognize literally any object you point at it — whether it has been “tagged” with an AR code or not.\\xa0Blippar co-founder and CEO Ambarish Mitra showed off the new version of the mobile app today at the Code/Media conference at The Ritz-Carlton, Laguna Niguel in Dana Point, Calif. He pointed the app at a variety of random objects — a magazine, a salad and an apple — to demonstrate how the app’s image recognition capabilities work.\\xa0“This is a really big change in our business model,” Mitra had said in an interview before the conference kicked off. “Initially, AR was about very static image recognition. You store images of Starbucks or Coca-Cola or General Mills in our database, and the images match. But now you’re able to analyze any environment in the world in real time, over a 3G connection.”\\xa0Mitra said over the past year and a half he has moved his technology team from the U.K. to Mountain View, Calif., to focus on machine learning, which is all the rage in Silicon Valley right now, with everyone from small upstarts to behemoths like Google trying to crack the code on how to make accurate predictions from large sets of data. (Google, actually, has an app that works similarly called Google Goggles, but it works when you point the app at a QR code or a famous landmark or something else recognizable — not necessarily everyday objects.)\\xa0In short, this is not an easy thing to do. In fact, ahead of the event, one of our staffers tried it out by pointing the app at his dog, and it thought the pup was a goat.\\xa0Mitra has said that, right now, the technology has elementary capabilities, like the brain of a six-year-old; it can recognize “car,” but not “Prius,” or it can recognize an item of clothing, but not the label. However, with machine learning, the app should be able to get to the level of an 18-year-old pretty quickly, Mitra said, in terms of its recognition abilities. And during the onstage demo, it did properly identify a pug named Milton as a dog.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

Yet they are still figuring out how to make virtual reality the kind of technology that people cannot live without. So for inspiration, they are turning to science fiction. At Oculus, a leading virtual reality company, a copy of the popular sci-fi novel “Ready Player One” is handed out to new hires. Magic Leap, a secretive augmented reality start-up, has hired science fiction and fantasy writers. The name of Microsoft’s HoloLens headset is a salute to the holodeck, a simulation room from “Star Trek.” “Like many other people working in the tech space, I’m not a creative person,” said Palmer Luckey, 23, a co-founder of Oculus, which was bought by Facebook for $2 billion in 2014. “It’s nice that science fiction exists because these are really creative people figuring out what the ultimate use of any technology might be. They come up with a lot of incredible ideas.” Those ideas are especially relevant now, as some of the biggest technology companies are nearing a major push of a new generation of virtual reality products. In the next few months, virtual reality headsets from Oculus, Sony and HTC go on sale. Venture capital money is pouring into the industry. But how people will interact with the imaginary worlds remains largely unknown territory. And that is where science fiction comes in. Science fiction is shaping the language companies are using to market the technology, influencing the types of experiences made for the headsets and even defining long-term goals for developers. “Science fiction, in simplest terms, sets you free,” said Ralph Osterhout, chief executive of the Osterhout Design Group, which builds augmented reality glasses. Techies do not need any encouragement from their employers to read or watch science fiction, long a pillar of geek culture. The genre has influenced many corners of technology, from smartphones to robotics to space exploration. But there is something unique about the interplay between science fiction and virtual reality, a technology that is essentially an instrument for fooling people into believing they are someplace — and often someone — they are not. Virtual reality is a medium, like television or video games, that can borrow liberally from the virtual worlds experienced by fictional characters. Magic Leap, based in Dania Beach, Fla., and which counts Google as one of its big investors, has gone even further than most companies by hiring three science fiction and fantasy writers on staff. Its most famous sci-fi recruit is Neal Stephenson, who depicted the virtual world of the Metaverse in his seminal 1992 novel “Snow Crash.” In an interview, Mr. Stephenson — whose title is chief futurist — declined to say what he was working on at Magic Leap, describing it as one of several “content projects” underway at the company.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow to write emails if you want people to actually respond:\\xa0\\xa0Having trouble getting replies to your emails? Apparently, one of the best ways to get a reply is to write as if you\\'re 9 years old. That\\'s according to the makers of the Boomerang mail plug-in, who found that writing at a third-grade reading level seems to be the right level of complexity for the average message, after mining their user data for information on what kind of writing actually gets replies. Here\\'s a full list of the tips from the makers of Boomerang: Use shorter sentences with simpler words. A 3rd grade reading level works best. Include 1-3 questions in your email. Make sure you include a subject line! Aim for 3-4 words. Use a slightly positive or slightly negative tone. Both outperform a completely neutral tone. Take a stand! Opinionated messages see higher response rates than objective ones. Write enough, but not too much. Try to keep messages between 50-125 words.\\n\\n\\nTwitter not reliable predictor of election outcomes: study:\\xa0In politics, it is said that all press is good press. But that does not necessarily apply to tweets, according to a study released this week. In fact, it is difficult to predict the outcome of an election based on the amount of Twitter buzz a candidate gets, according to the study from the Social Science Computer Review. The study, whose relevance to this year\\'s U.S. election was sharply disputed by Twitter, focused on the 2013 German federal election and found that Twitter data was a more accurate measure of the level of interest in candidates rather than the level of support they will receive. The daily volume of Twitter messages referring to candidates or parties fluctuates heavily depending on the events of the day - such as televised leaders’ debates, high-profile interviews with candidates - or the coverage of political controversies and scandals,\" the study said. The data also showed that Twitter users did not necessarily reflect the demographics of the population as a whole. In the United States, social media platforms like Twitter and Yik Yak are often more popular among millennial voters. A Twitter spokesman argued the study was not relevant to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. \"I\\'d advise passing the next time someone sends along German Twitter data from three years ago in the context of the 2016 U.S. election,\" said Nick Pacilio, a spokesman for the social media site\\'s government and news department. Pacilio cited a Time magazine website report that showed Twitter chatter favored the winning candidates, Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, in the Iowa caucuses this month.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter Zenefits, Will VCs Rein in Their Unicorns? The $4.5 billion benefits startup moved fast and broke things—maybe even the law:\\xa0In a Feb. 1 meeting at its blandly luxurious Sand Hill Road offices, venture firm Andreessen Horowitz urged the chief executive officer of one of its most prized and promising companies to resign. Zenefits makes software designed to simplify and automate such HR tasks as health insurance signups. At three years old, it’s valued at $4.5 billion and is one of the fastest-growing business software companies ever. Under founding CEO Parker Conrad, it also made software that allowed its employees to skirt state regulatory requirements, the company now admits. Days after Chief Operating Officer David Sacks gave that information to Lars Dalgaard, an Andreessen partner who sits on Zenefits’ board, Conrad was out, say three people familiar with the matter. At Conrad’s suggestion, they replaced him with Sacks, a Silicon Valley fixture who’s worked at Microsoft and co-founded Yammer, the business chat company. In Zenefits’ early days, the people say, Conrad created a deceptive program called “the Macro,” which made it look like employees were watching legally mandated online training when they weren’t. Workers who claimed to have completed the training may have been well short of the required 52 hours. Conrad used it himself, the people say. California regulators are investigating Zenefits’ use of the Macro, as well as whether its employees had licenses when they started selling insurance. On Feb. 8, Sacks announced Conrad’s resignation in an internal e-mail. “For us, compliance is like oxygen. Without it, we die,” Sacks wrote. “Many of our internal processes, controls, and actions around compliance have been inadequate, and some decisions have just been plain wrong. As a result, Parker has resigned.” Conrad declined to comment. Zenefits’ financial issues were discussed during the Feb. 1 board meeting. Andreessen co-founder Ben Horowitz, who isn’t a Zenefits director, attended. But two people close to the post-Conrad Zenefits say the Macro, not sales misses, was responsible for the CEO’s resignation. At the meeting, Conrad tentatively agreed to resign, relinquish his board seat, and make Sacks CEO, say three people close to the company. People close to Conrad now say he’s agitated by how Sacks’s very public letters to employees have characterized his departure and blamed him for Zenefits’ compliance problems. The accusations that unlicensed Zenefits brokers were selling insurance became public on Nov. 25 when BuzzFeed reporter Will Alden began publishing articles on the matter. California and Washington state are investigating Zenefits’ sales. The company says it’s cooperating with those probes and conducting its own, and it’s hired PricewaterhouseCoopers for a third-party assessment. Sacks declined to comment. Two people close to Sacks say he first began to worry about the Macro’s possible criminal implications in late January, after receiving new information from the internal investigation. To verify that an insurance sales applicant has completed the 52 hours of training, California requires a signature that carries a perjury charge if violated.\\n\\n\\nAfter Nearly Going Pop, Google’s Project Loon Heads Into Carrier Testing This Year:\\xa0\\xa0Google’s “moonshot” to deliver Internet to remote parts of the world using high-flying balloons has survived a brutal development phase, and will enter testing with carriers in Indonesia and elsewhere this year. But Project Loon almost didn’t make it. Google struggled to find a balloon design that could be inexpensive and durable enough to not only float but navigate to predictably travel through the stratosphere. “We busted a lot of balloons,” said Astro Teller, head of Alphabet’s X unit (formerly Google X), showing off some of the designs to the crowd at the annual TED conference, which kicked off Monday in Vancouver. There were shiny balloons and round balloons and balloons that looked like giant pillows. But eventually the company found a design that could be made cheaply and still navigate precisely. That balloon, Teller said, last year travelled around the world 19 times over 187 days. “So we are going to keep going,” Teller said, noting that what was once a slow connection has advanced enough to deliver about 15 megabits-per-second Internet access, which he pointed out is enough to deliver video — such as a live broadcast of his TED talk. The next step will be seeing how it works delivering real Internet service to consumers. In addition to Indonesia, Alphabet has reached a deal with the Sri Lankan government to exchange access to needed radio frequency spectrum for a stake in the project. Alphabet is in talks with carriers around the world, Teller said, adding that the prospect is very real and that a further five billion people will have Internet access within five to 10 years. On the TED stage, Teller also talked about two moonshots that Google abandoned. The first, he said, was vertical farming, which would have used one-tenth the water and one one-hundreth of the land demanded by traditional agriculture. But although Google grew some lettuce, it never managed to grow staple crops like grain or rice. Another effort would have allowed landlocked countries to ship goods far more cheaply using a rocket-like air cargo ship that could land without a runway. The idea itself might have worked, Teller said, but just building the first unit would have cost $200 million. Even for a company with Google’s riches, that proved too much to gamble. “If there is an Achilles’ heel in one of our projects, we want to know it right now,” Teller said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMattel Unveils ThingMaker, A $300 3D Printer That Lets Kids Make Their Own Toys:\\xa0Autodesk was tasked with building this app which early testers, including those at Toyland, have already described as “fast,” “easy to navigate” and “ridiculously intuitive.”Called ThingMaker Design, the app includes a variety of built-in character templates and easy-to-use tutorials that help novices get started. But it also allows for designing characters from scratch, once kids get the hang of things. The toys can be customized with different colors and textures, and will bend and twist in the app so you can get a feel for how they’ll work after they’ve been printed. The creations can be saved as images to the mobile device’s Camera Roll, or uploaded to Google Drive or Dropbox. When a design is complete, the app lets you export the STL print files wirelessly to your at-home printer, whether Mattel’s or otherwise. The idea isn’t just to print an object and be done, however – instead, kids will print parts that can be assembled to form larger creations, like dolls, robots, dinosaurs, scorpions, skeletons, bracelets or necklaces, for example. What’s interesting here is the potential for Mattel to tie into other children’s’ brands it already owns or licenses and bring them to life through 3D printing. That’s something the company says is on the roadmap, saying it will launch “additional design content, including branded options” at a later date. No actual brand names were announced, however, but there were hints that brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels were already being planned. The physical parts are printed in batches then assembled through ball-and-socket joints that snap together. This process can take anywhere from 30 minutes for a small item, up to overnight (e.g. 6 6 to 8 hours) for a larger toy.Mattel says its ThingMaker 3D will use a hard PLA filament, but also hasn’t yet announced the colors that will be available. According to reports from the Toy Fair, though, there were some two dozen colors on display. A spokesperson said the company may release other materials in the future.\\n\\n\\nIndia\\'s Snapdeal raises $200 million led by Ontario Teachers\\' Pension Plan:Indian online marketplace Snapdeal has raised $200 million in a fresh funding round led by Canada\\'s Ontario Teachers\\' Pension Plan, the company said.\\xa0The latest fund-raising follows $500 million raised last August in a round led by Alibaba, SoftBank and Foxconn.\\n\\n\\nSoftBank Rises the Most in Seven Years on Record Share Buyback:\\xa0SoftBank climbed the most in more than seven years after the company said it will spend a record 500 billion yen ($4.4 billion) buying back stock.\\xa0The stock rose as much as 15 percent to 5,040 yen as of 9:26 a.m. in Tokyo on Tuesday. SoftBank will purchase as many as 167 million shares, or 14.2 percent of its stock, using cash holdings and the proceeds of asset sales, the Tokyo-based company said in a statement Monday.\\xa0The Japanese wireless carrier saw its shares drop to their lowest since buying Sprint Corp. in 2013 as Chairman Masayoshi Son struggled to persuade investors he can turn around the U.S. company. The shares were down 28 percent this year before the buyback announcement, putting SoftBank’s market value well below that of its own investments in companies including Sprint and Alibaba.\\xa0“This is a good buyback, considering how low their valuation has fallen,” said Atul Goyal, an analyst at Jefferies Group LLC. “Nothing so bad happened with Sprint and Alibaba to justify the drop in SoftBank shares.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCreating a Computer Voice That People Like:\\xa0The challenge of creating a computer “personality” is now one that a growing number of software designers are grappling with as computers become portable and users with busy hands and eyes increasingly use voice interaction.Machines are listening, understanding and speaking, and not just computers and smartphones. Voices have been added to a wide range of everyday objects like cars and toys, as well as household information “appliances” like the home-companion robots Pepper and Jibo, and Alexa, the voice of the Amazon Echo speaker device. A new design science is emerging in the pursuit of building what are called “conversational agents,” software programs that understand natural language and speech and can respond to human voice commands. However, the creation of such systems, led by researchers in a field known as human-computer interaction design, is still as much an art as it is a science. It is not yet possible to create a computerized voice that is indistinguishable from a human one for anything longer than short phrases that might be used for weather forecasts or communicating driving directions.Most software designers acknowledge that they are still faced with crossing the “uncanny valley,” in which voices that are almost human-sounding are actually disturbing or jarring. The phrase was coined by the Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori in 1970. He observed that as graphical animations became more humanlike, there was a point at which they would become creepy and weird before improving to become indistinguishable from videos of humans. Beyond correct pronunciation, there is the even larger challenge of correctly placing human qualities like inflection and emotion into speech. Linguists call this “prosody,” the ability to add correct stress, intonation or sentiment to spoken language. Today, even with all the progress, it is not possible to completely represent rich emotions in human speech via artificial intelligence. The first experimental-research results — gained from employing machine-learning algorithms and huge databases of human emotions embedded in speech — are just becoming available to speech scientists.\\n\\n\\nWhy robots and smart thermostats keep America’s spy chief up at night:\\xa0Some people are already used to having their personal information exposed in massive data breaches. But the rise of artificial intelligence and connected computers in everything from toasters to implanted medical device could dramatically raise the stakes of digital security. In fact, they topped a long list of \"global threats\" that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper unveiled Tuesday before the Senate Armed Services committee. \"The Internet of Things will connect tens of billions of new physical devices that could be exploited,\" Clapper wrote in his Senate testimony. \"Artificial intelligence will enable computers to make autonomous decisions\" that hackers could disrupt to cause chaos. For the nation\\'s spy chief to place those threats so high on his list is a big deal, and it reflects how deeply concerned the intelligence community is about the potential pitfalls of these technologies. But Clapper also found a silver lining, writing in his assessment that the technology can \"also create new opportunities for our own intelligence collectors.\" In other words, you can expect America\\'s intelligence community to use driverless cars, smart thermostats and automated networks for spying purposes, too. And indeed, in the written assessment Clapper notes that \"intelligence services might use the IoT for identification, surveillance, monitoring, location tracking, and targeting for recruitment, or to gain access to networks or user credentials,\" in the future. Back in 2013, for example, the Federal Trade Commission cracked down on a company that sold web-connected cameras. The privacy watchdog alleged that faulty software packaged with the devices, which were marketed as secure, left private video feeds exposed online, eventually allowing hackers to share links to live streams from 700 customers\\' homes online. More alarming is the potential for people to be able exploit devices to cause lethal results, from medical equipment to cars. Last year, the Food and Drug Administration warned hospitals not to use one kind of drug pump after researchers uncovered a flaw that \"could allow an unauthorized user to control the device and change the dosage the pump delivers, which could lead to over- or under-infusion of critical patient therapies.\"\\n\\n\\nApple May Ditch Samsung For Next iPhone Chip:\\xa0Apple and Samsung have been asymmetric competitors for years, fighting to grab smartphone market share and partnering when it comes to chips. According to a recent report from The Electronic Times, TSMC (the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) will be the only company manufacturing the A10 for the next iPhone. Samsung won’t be working with Apple for the next iPhone. This isn’t an overnight change as Apple has already been working with TSMC in the past. The A9 chips in the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are currently manufactured by both TSMC and Samsung. Before that, TSMC was the sole supplier of the A8 for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Using multiple manufacturing partners provide different advantages. First, it’s a good way to make sure that you won’t have any supply shortage. Given that Apple sells tens of millions of iPhones per quarter, it’s unclear whether Samsung alone or TSMC alone can manufacture enough chips for all these phones. Samsung and TSMC also manufacture chips for other phones as well. Second, negotiating with multiple companies lets you get better prices. It’s unclear whether Samsung is more expensive than TSMC, but Apple can drive the prices down as the A10 represents a huge contract. Finally, Apple can pick the most efficient design. TSMC’s A9 was slightly better when it comes to battery life. So Apple might favor TSMC for this reason as well. According to The Electronic Times, TSMC should start production of the A10 in June ahead of the iPhone 7 release this Fall. It could feature a 10nm design. We’ll have to wait for an iPhone 7 teardown to learn more about the A10. For the end customer, it doesn’t change much if your iPhone chip is manufactured by TSMC or Samsung. Both companies implement Apple’s own CPU design. But Samsung’s chip business could take a hit from this failed contract.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPandora Is Said to Have Held Talks About Selling Itself:\\xa0\\xa0Pandora Media, the largest Internet radio service, has held discussions about selling the company, according to people briefed on the talks. Pandora is working with Morgan Stanley to meet with potential buyers, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The talks are preliminary and may not lead to a deal, the people said. For Pandora, it would be a curious time to sell. Its shares are yielding a market value of $1.8 billion, down from more than $7 billion two years ago. The stock has fallen more than 60 percent since October. Pandora has the largest number of users for music streaming, but the competition is encroaching. Spotify is said to be arming itself with another $500 million in capital, and Apple Music recently surpassed 10 million paying users. Pandora’s users peaked at 81.5 million at the end of 2014, and, after falling to about 78 million in the third quarter of 2015, ended the year with 81.1 million. The company is spending heavily to attract users, and its ability to make money from those users may be waning. In the third quarter, Pandora lowered its full-year financial guidance, expecting its adjusted earnings to be $51 million to $56 million, down from the $75 million to $85 million it projected in the quarter before. “It has lots of users but can’t grow revenue quickly enough,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. “It is another stumbling pioneer.”\\n\\n\\nFor Analysts, Loving LinkedIn Was Wrong:\\xa0It’s not often Wall Street says “I’m sorry.” But after LinkedIn reported its earnings on Feb. 4, about a dozen financial analysts with varying strategies and sensibilities issued mea culpas. Some had rated LinkedIn a buy a few hours before its downgraded forecast. They watched in horror as its stock fell more than 40 percent, bottoming out below $104 on Feb. 5. Some put it more simply than others. “We were wrong,” SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Bob Peck wrote in a Feb. 5 note downgrading the stock to “neutral.” (He’d praised LinkedIn’s odds of continued progress two weeks earlier.) Mizuho Securities lamented the company’s “significantly slower” growth prospects, while James Cakmak at Monness Crespi Hardt said he was no longer sure even LinkedIn’s slower growth would be sustainable. LinkedIn took a beating even though its earnings report was consistent with recent performance. As usual, it beat earnings expectations, then issued a lower-than-expected sales forecast for the year. It delivered a similarly disappointing projection in last year’s second quarter, at which point its stock dipped 19 percent. But now Wall Street is more skeptical of the tech stocks it once assumed would grow forever. Until Feb. 5, LinkedIn looked like an ideal tech stock to own, almost like a combination of Facebook and Salesforce.com. A free network for professionals, it has the ingredients to grow virally, like a social media company. It sells services to recruiters, salespeople, and marketers, giving it several ways to snag recurring revenue. “This was considered one of the preeminent names, like Facebook and Google,” says Peck. Now reality is setting in, and to expand, LinkedIn has to do more difficult and expensive things, like developing and selling more product lines. “When companies hit these growth walls, people just react really strongly,” says Lemkin. Walls are springing up all over. On its earnings call, LinkedIn announced it had shut down Sales Accelerator, a software tool designed to connect businesses with potential customers, because of a lack of interest. Analysts had said the feature would be worth millions. LinkedIn’s overall user growth slowed, it got tougher to hold on to paid users, and the company had to lean harder on its sales staff. Small factors added up, and analysts were “blindsided,” says Monness Crespi’s Cakmak.\\n\\n\\nDelivery Start-Ups Face Road Bumps in Quest to Capture Untapped Market:\\xa0DoorDash, one of a multitude of start-ups with a mobile app that lets people order and get food sent to their doorsteps, relies on contract drivers like Brian Navarro to make the deliveries. The problem is that workers like Mr. Navarro don’t always stick around. Mr. Navarro began driving for DoorDash and another delivery start-up, Postmates, in Los Angeles about four months ago. Mr. Navarro, 40, who previously drove for the ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft, said he had seen plenty of contractors quit DoorDash and other delivery companies during the time he has worked with them. The issue is just one headache now troubling delivery start-ups, which have been among the hottest sectors of start-up activity in recent years. Based on a belief that the companies would succeed once they grew to enormous scale, investors poured more than $730 million into delivery firms like DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates from early 2014 through the first half of 2015, up more than 1,100 percent from the same period a year and a half ago, according to data from CB Insights, a venture capital analytics firm. But entrepreneurs and investors are beginning to find that the economics of making a delivery service work are far from easy. Good Eggs, an organic grocery delivery service, laid off more than 100 employees and shuttered its offices outside its San Francisco headquarters in August. Instacart, the grocery delivery service, recently laid off 12 recruiters, which the company said was “part of an overall plan to slow down hiring” after a growth spree last year. And DoorDash has been turned down by some venture capitalists as it has tried to raise new financing, according to three people familiar with the company’s plans. The problems are rooted in the high operating costs of the start-ups, which typically act as middlemen between consumers and restaurants or grocery stores. The companies not only have to pay for large fleets of drivers, they also have big groups of employees who receive customer orders from the apps and who then manually make calls to the restaurants to order food. At the same time, to attract customers, many of the start-ups offer introductory prices and discounts, often making delivery free for first-time users. As DoorDash’s experience with drivers shows, the start-ups’ costs don’t necessarily decline over time. For some drivers, who are paid a fee per delivery, it can be difficult to make enough deliveries in an hour to make it financially worthwhile for them. And when drivers move on, the companies must spend again to recruit replacements.\\n\\n\\nGroupon Soars 23% On Favorable Earnings:\\xa0Not dead yet, deal site Groupon soared 23% in initial after-hours trading, following a better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings release. The company beat revenue forecasts, bringing in $917 million, instead of the anticipated $846 million, and a 9% year-over-year increase. \\xa0Adjusted earnings per share was a four cents, whereas Wall Street was expecting zero. This is quite the bright spot for the company — until today, the stock had been down 71% in the past year. Shares closed Thursday at $2.24, a far cry from the $20 per share the company saw when it went public in November 2011. Groupon has expanded beyond its core local deal business, acquiring services like Ideel, for fashion discounts and OrderUp, for food delivery. But perhaps until now, nothing has been able to change investor perception that the Groupon brand is tarnished. At one point, the company held acquisition conversations with Google, around a $6 billion price tag. \\xa0Today, Groupon closed the day with a market cap of $1.4 billion.\\n\\n\\nThe Difference Between Facebook and Twitter:\\xa0Twitter Is Lonely for New Users: The simplest reason Facebook has built a massive gap between the two companies over the past three years is that you don’t feel alone on Facebook. It’s easy to find connections because everyone you’ve ever met and their mother is already on the social network. (Seriously, all my friend’s moms have Facebook accounts.) Posting isn’t intimidating because you know who’s going to see it (your approved friends), and you’re almost always guaranteed some kind of feedback on what you share. It may be a “pity Like” from your cousin or your college roommate, but I can’t recall ever seeing a Facebook post that didn’t have at least one like or comment. I don’t care who you are, social validation feels good. Twitter, on the other hand, is lonely, especially for new users. Unless you’re a politician or a celebrity, signing up for Twitter probably means spending your first few days on the service (if not weeks or months) with close to zero followers. Tweeting into a black hole is not fun. Finding relevant conversations is not easy, and venturing into strangers’ conversations takes courage. It’s still too hard to find people to follow when you first sign up on Twitter. The company has made it easier to follow celebrities and media organizations you might want to hear from, but finding people you might actually interact with is a massive challenge the company still hasn’t figured out. I see engagement-less tweets all the time. These things hurt Twitter’s growth because they push people away before they ever see benefit from the platform. That’s why, as of two years ago, nearly a billion people had signed up for Twitter, most of whom never stuck around. (The numbers of deserters is probably much higher today.) The easiest way to fix this problem is to fix Twitter’s feed, which does a great job funneling in a constant stream of live updates and a horrible job helping your tweets get seen. I have 11,000 followers, people I assume follow me because they want to see what I’m tweeting. I tweeted 22 times last week, and my tweets were seen, on average, 3,500 times apiece. (This includes one super-popular tweet that got lots of views thanks to a retweet from an NFL player with a big following.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter User Growth Comes to a Halt - Stock Down After Quarterly Earnings:\\xa0On Wednesday, after many quarters of slowing user growth, Twitter said its monthly visitors in the fourth quarter totaled 320 million — exactly the same as the company reported in the previous quarter. While the number was up 9 percent from a year ago, when monthly active users stood at 288 million, the figures showed that Mr. Dorsey’s recent moves have made little impact in attracting users. The user figures overshadowed otherwise positive fourth-quarter earnings results. Twitter reported revenue of $710 million, up 48 percent from $479 million a year ago. Net loss narrowed to $90.2 million, or 13 cents a share, from a loss of $125 million, or 20 cents a share, in the same quarter last year. But Twitter’s outlook was lower than projected by Wall Street. The company estimated revenue of $595 million to $610 million in the current quarter, compared with Wall Street expectations of $628 million. Shares of Twitter have been pummeled in the last year, dropping around 67 percent. The stock declined in after-hours trading on Wednesday.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook Disavows Marc Andreessen Comments on India, and He Apologizes:\\xa0\\xa0Marc Andreessen, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist and board member of the social network Facebook, has long been one of its vocal supporters. On Wednesday, Facebook did not welcome that support. Hundreds of users, many of whom said they were of Indian descent, reacted negatively to Mr. Andreessen’s comment and what appeared to be his pro-colonialist sentiment. The tweet has since been deleted. Facebook swiftly swatted down Mr. Andreessen’s comments on Wednesday. “We strongly reject the sentiments expressed by Marc Andreessen last night regarding India,” Facebook said in a statement. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, also posted on the social network that he found Mr. Andreessen’s comments “deeply upsetting, and they do not represent the way Facebook or I think at all.” He added that through his travels to India, he has “gained a deeper appreciation for the need to understand India’s history and culture.” A spokeswoman for Mr. Andreessen did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Andreessen posted new tweets in which he apologized for his previous comments, an apology he later repeated. “I now withdraw from all future discussions of Indian economics and politics, and leave them to people with more knowledge and experience!” he wrote.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTesla expects to become profitable in 2016, shares surge:\\xa0Tesla Motors Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk on Wednesday promised investors that the electric luxury car maker will start making money this year, sending the company\\'s shares up sharply despite a wider fourth-quarter loss.Tesla shares rose more than 10 percent in after-hours trading after the company forecast a 60 to 80 percent increase in vehicle sales this year and promised it would turn a profit on an adjusted basis. It will start generating positive cash flow in March. Tesla shares are still down more than 30 percent since the beginning of the year, reflecting investor concerns about continued losses. Tesla’s cash reserves dropped to $1.2 billion as of Dec. 31 from $1.9 billion a year earlier, despite a sale of shares last summer. The company’s cash burn has become a concern for some analysts, given the heavy capital spending it has mapped out. The slower-than-planned launch of the company\\'s Model X sport utility vehicle during the last quarter added $67 million in unplanned costs, Tesla said. Tesla shares rose despite a wider fourth-quarter net loss of $2.44 a share, compared with a loss of 86 cents a share a year earlier. Tesla reported an adjusted loss of 87 cents per share in the fourth quarter, while analysts expected a profit of 10 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Deliveries of Model S sedans and Model X SUVs were 17,478 vehicles in the quarter, at the low end of prior forecasts. Revenue rose nearly 27 percent to a $1.21 billion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCisco beats profit estimates, adds $15 billion to buyback:\\xa0Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by higher demand for its routers and security products, and added $15 billion to its share buyback program. The company\\'s shares rose 5.1 percent in after-market trading on Wednesday. The results were a bright sign for investors after several tech stocks with lofty valuations plunged in the past few days due to disappointing sales outlooks from LinkedIn Corp and Tableau Software. Cisco is shifting to high-end switches and routers and investing in new products such as data analytics software and cloud-based tools for data centers. Revenue in the company\\'s routers business rose 5 percent to $1.85 billion in the second quarter ended Jan. 23, Cisco said. Revenue in the switches business, the company\\'s biggest, fell 4 percent to $3.48 billion. Its security business, which offers firewall protection as well as intrusion detection and prevention systems, recorded an 11 percent rise in revenue to $462 million. Cisco boosted its current share buyback plan of $97 billion, of which $16.9 billion was remaining, by $15 billion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon to buy back $5 billion of shares:\\xa0Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), the world\\'s largest e-commerce company, said on Wednesday its board authorized a $5 billion share buyback program. The buyback replaces the $2 billion repurchase program approved in 2010. The company had $763 million remaining under the previous plan. The company\\'s shares rose 1.5 percent to $498 in after-hours trading.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore Top-level churn at Flipkart:\\xa0Mukesh Bansal, head of marketplace and a board member at Flipkart, and chief business officer Ankit Nagori have decided to leave the e-commerce firm barely a month after a top-level reshuffle that led to a change in the roles of the company’s two founders. Separately, Flipkart announced that Nagori was also quitting the company. He had joined Flipkart about six years ago and quickly rose through the ranks. Mukesh Bansal didn’t specify a date by when he would leave the company but said he would continue to be available from outside as a mentor to the team. Mukesh had joined Flipkart nearly two years ago after the e-commerce firm acquired the online apparel retailer that he had founded, Myntra. Nagori, on the other hand, plans to start his own sports venture. Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal will back his new venture, said a post on Flipkart’s website.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon Building Global Delivery Business to Take On Alibaba:\\xa0In recent weeks, speculation has mounted that Amazon.com Inc. plans to launch a global shipping and logistics operation that will compete with United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp.Asked about reports that the company was leasing planes and had registered an ocean freight booking business, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky downplayed Amazon’s ambitions last month in an earnings call. He said the company was simply looking to supplement its delivery partners -- not replace them -- during peak periods like the Christmas shopping season. Amazon documents reviewed by Bloomberg News reveal a far bolder plan.A 2013 report to Amazon’s senior management team proposed an aggressive global expansion of the company’s Fulfillment By Amazon service, which provides storage, packing and shipping for independent merchants selling products on the company’s website. The report envisioned a global delivery network that controls the flow of goods from factories in China and India to customer doorsteps in Atlanta, New York and London. The project, called Dragon Boat, is proceeding, according to a person familiar with the initiative, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. The ambitious strategy promises to turn FedEx and UPS into Amazon rivals, but also will pit the Seattle giant against Chinese counterpart Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Both companies are vying for dominance of the rapidly growing cross-border e-commerce market, which by 2020 is expected to swell into a $1 trillion industry serving 900 million shoppers, according to a June report from Accenture and AliResearch, Alibaba’s research arm. Amazon’s plan would culminate with the launch of a new venture called “Global Supply Chain by Amazon,” as soon as this year, the documents said. The new business will locate Amazon at the center of a logistics industry that involves not just shippers like FedEx and UPS but also legions of middlemen who handle cargo and paperwork associated with transnational trade. Amazon wants to bypass these brokers, amassing inventory from thousands of merchants around the world and then buying space on trucks, planes and ships at reduced rates. Merchants will be able to book cargo space online or via mobile devices, creating what Amazon described as a “one click-ship for seamless international trade and shipping.”\\n\\n\\nFederal Government Will Treat Google’s Driverless Car System as a Legal Driver:\\xa0Google’s robot just got its driver’s license. On Tuesday, the federal agency that sets road rules — the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) — released a letter to the Internet giant that supports its interpretation of a driverless system as legally adequate for roadways, a key victory for the critical initiative within Alphabet, Google’s parent company. Previously, the NHTSA only considered humans as drivers under law, because that’s how cars worked until Google came along. Now the agency has said it will consider Google’s self-driving system a driver, too. The letter came in response to a November petition from Chris Urmson, the director of Google’s self-driving car project. Urmson argued that regulators should treat Google’s homemade cars, built without a steering wheel and brakes, on par with human drivers. It’s been a persistent sticking point for the Google unit, particularly after California issued draft autonomous vehicle rules expressly prohibiting driverless cars. Ensuring that its driverless fleet has regulatory approval to get on the roads is critical to Google’s car strategy.\\n\\n\\nPublic Markets Are Sending Some Ominous Signals to Private Tech Companies:\\xa0After years of rapidly growing valuations and additions to the \"Unicorn\" club, a number of private companies have seen their valuations take dramatic cuts. From Foursquare Labs Inc. raising funds at a roughly $250 million valuation versus a former round in 2013 at $600 million, to Fidelity writing down its Snapchat Inc. holding, there\\'s a lot of interest in where private tech companies might be valued right now. One way to think about private tech valuations is to look at publicly-traded entities that might reasonably seen as proxies. Here\\'s a few examples: The Bloomberg IPO index tracks the performance of companies during their first year of trading, and it has certainly taken a tumble. Cracks began to show late in 2015 as many of them fell below their IPO price. Charlie Bilello, Director of Research at Pension Partners, pointed out just how rare the positive performance of Facebook Inc. actually is, with firms like Groupon Inc., Etsy Inc., Twitter Inc., GoPro Inc., and LendingClub Corp. all down more than 40 percent from their offering price. The index is down 30 percent over the past year and 36 percent from recent highs. One company to keep an eye on is SVB Financial Group, which is the holding company for Silicon Valley Bank. This commercial bank serves emerging and middle-market growth companies in the fields of technology and life sciences.You could see it as a gauge of red-hot tech since it has done business with Pinterest, BuzzFeed, and others. Shares are down 43 percent from recent highs and 31 percent over the past year.\\n\\n\\nSolarCity Beats Q4 Estimates, But Stock Plunges 30 Percent On Soft Outlook:\\xa0SolarCity, which is down more than 50 percent over the past year, just released its Q4 2015 earnings. The market has reacted negatively, with the stock trading down about 30 percent after-hours at a price of around $17.50 per-share.\\xa0While Q4 revenue of $115M and loss of $2.37 per share beat estimates of $111M in revenue and a loss of $2.59 per share, the company’s Q1 2016 forecast was lower than expected. Additionally, the company missed its quarterly installation estimates for Q4, installing 272 MW, below the guidance of 280 MW – 300 MW.\\xa0In its shareholder letter, SolarCity said they expect to install 180 MW of solar panels in Q1 2016, which represents 18 percent year-over-year growth, but a 34 percent decline compared to the previous quarter.\\xa0While some seasonal slowdown for Q1 is normal, the company said that this estimate reflects a “higher-than-usual” seasonal slowdown.\\n\\n\\nGitHub Updates Its Enterprise Product With Clustering Support, Updated Design:\\xa0GitHub Enterprise, the company’s on-premises solution for managing code, is getting a major update today. It comes at a time when there seems to be some upheaval in the company around the importance management has been putting on this product.\\xa0The marquee feature of GitHub Enterprise 2.5 is support for clustering. With this, businesses can now set up a cluster of GitHub Enterprise servers that act as a single installation, enabling it to support significantly larger teams.\\xa0“With GitHub Enterprise 2.5 more users can be enabled on one system as teams grow,” Kakul Srivastava, GitHub’s VP of Product, tells me. “We have customers with tens of thousands of developers who need to be able to work together, and this is really important functionality to enable them to do this in a scalable way.”\\xa0She also noted that clustering doesn’t currently come at an additional cost to GitHub’s enterprise users.\\xa0This new version also includes interface improvements with updated designs for everything from log-in screens to the look and feel of the GitHub repositories. This brings GitHub’s enterprise product in line with its hosted version.\\xa0Also new in this version is improved Subversion support — for those who aren’t using git as their version control system — as well as an API for managing protected branches (that is, branches developers can neither delete nor force-push their code to). This new API is currently in preview.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook Loses a Battle in India Over Its Free Basics Program:\\xa0For years, Mark Zuckerberg has had a grander vision than just connecting the more than one billion people who already use Facebook: He wants to connect the entire world. That effort hit a major roadblock on Monday, when Indian regulators banned free mobile data programs that favor some Internet services over others. The regulations, issued after months of intense public debate over how to extend the Internet to India’s poorest citizens, effectively block Facebook’s controversial Free Basics program in the country. Free Basics offers people no-fee access to a text-only mobile version of the Facebook social network, as well as to certain news, health, job and other services. Facebook describes the program as a way to introduce the poor and the technologically unskilled to the potential of the Internet. Free Basics came out of Mr. Zuckerberg’s program for universal Internet access, which was started in 2013 under an initiative called Internet.org. The idea was to simplify phone applications to run more efficiently and to offer these apps to users in developing countries. Half a dozen of the world’s tech giants, including Samsung, Nokia, Qualcomm and Ericsson, agreed to work with Facebook as partners on the initiative. Free Basics is now in 38 countries, from Indonesia to Panama. Facebook is investing heavily in other parts of the project, including experiments to deliver cheap Wi-Fi to remote villages and to beam Internet service from high-flying drones. In India, where Facebook already has at least 132 million users, the company began offering Free Basics last year through Reliance Communications, a local mobile phone carrier. A Reliance spokesman could not be reached for comment. The program quickly became the target of critics, who said that it was an attempt to steer unsophisticated new Internet users to Facebook and other services that were working with the company. They argued that Free Basics and other so-called zero rating programs, which are a set of apps or sites that a mobile operator or I.S.P. does not charge customers to use, violated the concept of net neutrality. Facebook embarked on a blitz of paid lobbying and advertising to promote Free Basics, spending millions of dollars in media campaigns to convince locals its offering would be positive for the population. The company ran special banners in the Facebook news feeds of Indian users urging them to petition the government to allow Free Basics. Mr. Zuckerberg personally lobbied against the new rules, including writing an opinion column in The Times of India. Experts said that campaign may have had an adverse effect on Indian thinking. Locals were wary of the company’s unknown long-term plans for advertising or other parts of Facebook’s business.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJob Site Hired Raises $40 Million and Forecasts Profit by 2017:\\xa0When Mehul Patel, Hired Inc.\\'s chief executive officer, began talking to venture capitalists last year for the company\\'s latest fundraising round, they were no longer interested in hearing about market potential or user growth. Investors wanted to know when the job recruitment website would become profitable. Patel tailored his pitch to highlight the ways he\\'d made his startup run more efficiently while showing that Hired would roughly triple annual revenue in 2016. He forecast a profit by early 2017. \"The conversation had really changed from a year ago,\" he said. Hired faces many larger and more established competitors. CareerBuilder.com, Indeed Inc., LinkedIn Corp., and Monster Worldwide Inc. each control segments of the online jobs market. Monster generated revenue of $770 million in 2014. Although LinkedIn had a rough time last week, the site generated $862 million in just its last quarter. Hired said it has a 2016 revenue \"run rate\" of $100 million. (The number is generally calculated by using the performance during one period as the basis to project a full year.) Hired is cost-free for job seekers, who create profiles listing their skills and backgrounds. About 4 percent of applicants are accepted. Recruiters from companies such as American Express Co., Comcast Corp., and Facebook Inc., pay to target those high-skill candidates and send them offers via e-mail. Since it began in 2012, Hired has expanded from tech workers in San Francisco to sales, marketing, and other professionals in 15 cities. The company has acquired two small startups in Paris and Melbourne to help it continue expanding internationally. Patel said he\\'s constantly looking for ways to cut costs. The startup has moved three times in as many years because it was unwilling to commit to a long-term lease. The chairs at the company\\'s San Francisco office are mostly from Ikea. Patel said he bought a Herman Miller model for his home office from a startup that shut down during the first dot-com crash. \"That\\'s still my office chair,\" he said. \"It reminds me not to let things get too crazy.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSacked! Twitter and Facebook Experience a Super Bowl Down Round:\\xa0Sunday’s Super Bowl was, to put it bluntly, pretty boring. That was reflected on the Internet as well: Despite it being the 50th Super Bowl and most likely the last game for future Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning, both Facebook and Twitter saw significantly less Super Bowl chatter than they did last year. Facebook reported that 60 million people created some 200 million posts, comments and “likes” throughout the game. Those numbers are down from last year, when 65 million people generated 265 million posts, comments and likes. That’s about 25 percent less activity for those keeping score. Twitter had it even worse. Much worse, in fact. Roughly 3.8 million people created 16.9 million tweets during the game, according to Nielsen. That’s down from 25.1 million tweets sent during last year’s game, a drop of roughly 33 percent*. In fact, Twitter didn’t even share its total tweet metrics this year like it did in 2015. The company also didn’t immediately reply to our request for comment on Nielsen’s numbers. Yes, a lousy game doesn’t help. But a dip like this is not a great sign for either platform, both of which offered new features this year intended to increase engagement for a game just like this. On Twitter, that feature is Moments, a curated stream of tweets around a particular event. On Facebook, it’s Sports Stadium, a new area of the app dedicated to following live sporting events and talking with your friends about them. (The new feature had some technical difficulties Sunday afternoon.) Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey will be hit hardest from a poor showing like this. User conversations around live events are where Twitter is supposed to dominate. This kind of regression is exactly why the company stock is at an all-time low; investors are concerned about slowing user growth and the resulting engagement. Those same investors are bracing for the company’s earnings this week, and it could have used a nice Super Bowl boost to highlight on the earnings call. Apparently it’ll need to find something else.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZenefits CEO Parker Conrad Out Amid Compliance Concerns:\\xa0\\xa0There’s a big shuffle happening at Zenefits today — with Zenefits CEO Parker Conrad exiting the company and COO David Sacks taking over. Conrad is also stepping down as a director of the company. In an email to employees, Sacks noted that compliance issues that have plagued the company contributed to Conrad’s exit. Zenefits has hit significant turbulence, including missing revenue targets according to a Wall Street Journal report, and also running into issues with regulators. Regulatory issues have plagued the company, as has been reported by BuzzFeed. Zenefits allowed unlicensed brokers to sell health insurance, leading to at least one commissioner to investigate the company in Washington State, according to a BuzzFeed report. Most recently, BuzzFeed reported 80 percent of the company’s deals in Washington State were done by unlicensed brokers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVerizon enlists AOL CEO to explore Yahoo deal:\\xa0Bloomberg: Verizon Communications has given Tim Armstrong, chief executive officer of its AOL unit, a leading role in exploring a possible bid for Yahoo\\'s assets, Bloomberg reported, citing a person with knowledge of the situation. Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless carrier, hasn\\'t hired bankers to conduct an offer and there have been no formal talks, according to the report. Yahoo said last week that it would consider \"strategic alternatives\" for its core Internet business, even as it continues with its plan to revamp the business and spin it off. Yahoo\\'s core business, which includes popular services like Yahoo Mail and its news and sports sites, could attract private equity firms, media and telecom companies or firms like Softbank, analysts had said. Verizon\\'s Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in December that the U.S. wireless carrier could look at buying Yahoo\\'s core business if it was a good fit. Earlier this year, Verizon bought AOL Inc in a $4.4 billion deal to push into targeted advertising and mobile video. Verizon\\'s shares were down 1.1 percent, while Yahoo\\'s shares were down 4 percent in afternoon trading on Monday.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYelp posts smaller-than-expected loss; CFO to step down; Shares plunge:\\xa0Consumer review website operator Yelp Inc reported a smaller-than-expected loss on Monday, but its shares slumped 11 percent, swept up in a broader selloff in the technology sector coupled with a weak adjusted EBITDA forecast. The company said results were released about 3 hours ahead of schedule during trading hours on Monday, due to an error by PR Newswire, leading to a spike in volatility in its shares. Yelp also said Chief Financial Officer Rob Krolik would step down later this year but did not elaborate. Krolik, who joined in 2011, will continue in his role until Dec. 15, 2016, or until a replacement is hired, the company said in a statement. Yelp\\'s revenue rose about 40 percent in the fourth quarter, topping analysts\\' estimates, helped by the strength in its advertising business and a rise in mobile usage. Local advertising accounts in the quarter rose 32 percent to about 111,000, in line with estimates from market research firm FactSet StreetAccount. Revenue rose to $153.7 million from $109.9 million. Yelp reported a net loss of $22.2 million, or 29 cents per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $32.7 million, or 42 cents per share, a year earlier.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",
      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Said to Be on Course for Approval to Open Stores in India:\\xa0\\xa0Apple Inc. is on course to win clearance to open its first retail stores in India, a person with knowledge of the matter said, as Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook seeks growth opportunities in a nation of 1.3 billion people. The Indian government plans to push through Apple’s application to set up outlets, the person said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public. The company is resubmitting the request as it wasn’t in the right format, the person said, without giving a time-frame for final approval. Apple should qualify as a provider of cutting-edge technology, the person said. That would exempt the maker of iPhones and iPads from a rule forcing foreign businesses that retail a single brand in India to procure 30 percent of a product’s inputs locally. The company makes most of its devices in China. Cook is hunting for fresh sources of growth after Apple last month forecast a sales decline for the first time in more than a decade. India now has the world’s fastest-growing major economy and about 220 million smartphone users. The challenge is that Indian consumers tend to prefer cheaper devices, leaving Apple with only about 2 percent of the market. Apple uses re-sellers in India for its products. Domestic distributor Redington India Ltd. has dropped about 5 percent since Apple in January confirmed it had applied to open stores in Asia’s third-largest economy.\\n\\n\\nBlackBerry Confirms 200 Job Cuts in Florida and Canada:\\xa0Phone maker BlackBerry confirmed to Re/code on Friday that it has recently cut 200 jobs in both Sunrise, Fla., and at facilities in Canada. However, the company characterized them as a “small number” in stark contrast to a Mobile Syrup report that suggested massive cuts, especially at the main office. In a statement, BlackBerry said the cuts come as it continues its turnaround effort. “This means finding new ways to enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities, while driving toward sustainable profitability across all parts of our business,” the company said. “As a result, a small number of employees have been impacted in Waterloo and Sunrise, Fla.” The company later said that it made around 200 job cuts. It also confirmed that BBM founder and longtime employee Gary Klassen has left the company. The Mobile Syrup report suggests that the BlackBerry 10 development effort has been hit particularly hard. BlackBerry recently introduced the Priv, its first Android phone, and executives suggested that if customers agree, that could represent its hardware future rather than its homegrown BlackBerry 10.\\n\\n\\nWood Shop Enters the Age of High-Tech:\\xa0These days, tinkering is high tech. The blending of technology and craft in tools like 3-D printers and laser cutters has made it possible for ordinary people to make extraordinary things. And many ordinary people, living as they do, more and more in their heads and online, are yearning to do something with their hands. So the “maker space” movement — D.I.Y. communities to get people creating, be it for fun, for art or for entrepreneurship — is booming. Maker Faires are held around the world. Commercial operations like TechShop have popped up across the country. And tinkering is being promoted on college campuses from M.I.T. to Santa Clara University, as well as in high schools and elementary schools. There’s even a massive open online course, offered by the MOOC provider Coursera and taught by three scientists from the Exploratorium in San Francisco, called “Tinkering Fundamentals: A Constructionist Approach to STEM Learning.” At Rutgers, a bustling maker space can be found in a moldering wood-frame structure on the Livingston campus in Piscataway, N.J. The building once served as the command headquarters for Camp Kilmer, a transportation hub for soldiers mobilizing for World War II; today, the building, still called Headquarters, houses computer repair offices and the division of continuing studies. And upstairs, there are wonders. There are 3-D printers, which can be programmed to create wildly inventive shapes out of plastic or resin (like a decent copy of the Iron Throne from “Game of Thrones” or a bust of Groot from “Guardians of the Galaxy”). There is a laser cutter to etch materials like fabric, marble or wood and cut through plastic. Next door is an electronics shop, with racks upon racks of parts. Close by are drill presses, a router and a key cutter, which Mr. Carter refers to as “our gateway drug,” a piece of equipment neophytes can use to produce something they really need. A common space with couches and a television gives students a place to talk, show off their projects or just hang out.\\n\\n\\nTesla won’t give this ‘super rude’ customer his preordered car:\\xa0The customer is always right, goes the saying. But if you’re rude, don’t expect that maxim to apply universally as one man found out. Earlier this week Stewart Alsop, a San Francisco venture capitalist, shared that his order of a Tesla Model X was canceled after he wrote a blog post that criticized chief executive Elon Musk for starting a company event late. Alsop titled his late September post, “Dear @ElonMusk: You should be ashamed of yourself.” “For you to stand up at 8:52 p.m. and not even acknowledge that you have wasted your own customers’ time was insensitive and poor judgement,” Alsop wrote. Alsop said that he’d placed a $5,000 preorder for the Model X and expected to test drive it at the launch event on Sept. 29 in Fremont, Calif. But then the event started later than expected. The invitation noted that doors would open at 7 p.m., and encouraged guests to arrive by 7:30 p.m. A clear start time wasn’t specified, but according to Alsop, Musk conceded in a phone conversation that the event began 30 minutes late. When Musk arrived on stage he opened with what Alsop described as “an amateur slide show.” Alsop, angry and hungry, stormed out before the event ended. In a follow-up post this week Alsop said he’d been banned from ordering his Model X, and expressed shock given critical posts he’d authored on other companies such as BMW. He will be stuck continuing to drive his “irritating BMW X1.” Musk weighed in on the episode early Friday morning. “Must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer gets this much attention,” he tweeted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLinkedIn Shares Plummet 30% After Sales Outlook Trails Estimates:\\xa0LinkedIn Corp. shares lost almost a third of their value after the professional networking site forecast a year of slower revenue growth amid signs of weakness in sales of advertising and marketing tools. Revenue will be about $820 million in the first quarter, and $3.6 billion to $3.65 billion for 2016, the company said in a statement Thursday. That missed analysts’ average estimate for $867.1 million and $3.9 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. LinkedIn had 414 million users in the fourth quarter, up from 396 million in the prior period. While Chief Executive Officer Jeff Weiner has made investments to diversify the business, like acquiring education website Lynda.com for $1.5 billion last year, it will be a while before those efforts contribute meaningfully to revenue. In the meantime, LinkedIn is facing a slowdown in its marketing-services business, which companies use to find potential customers, show them ads and relevant information and generate sales leads. Sales to recruiters, who use LinkedIn to find candidates for jobs, are also slowing. LinkedIn is narrowing its focus in some areas, which is hurting sales. For example, it’s discontinuing a tool that helps marketers find leads, incorporating the technology into its sponsored content business instead, contributing to a slowdown in its marketing solutions business. Revenue in the marketing solutions division rose 20 percent in the fourth quarter to $183 million. The professional-networking website is also facing slower economic growth in Europe and Asia, though it said China is its fastest-growing country for new members. The company has a standalone app for Chinese users and has devoted much of its efforts over the past year to push deeper into that market. For the fourth quarter, LinkedIn reported a loss attributable to common shareholders of $8.43 million, compared with the average estimate for $50.2 million. Revenue climbed 34 percent to $862 million, topping the prediction for $857.4 million.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nSpotify Links Up With Amazon’s Echo:\\xa0It took a while, but Spotify and Amazon have started playing nicely: The streaming music service is now integrated into the Echo, Amazon’s connected speaker/shopping stimulator/robot spy machine you willingly install in your own house. Previously you could get Spotify working on Echo, but only if you worked at it. Now you can ask Alexa, Amazon’s AI assistant, to play Spotify, or you can control it from the Spotify app on your phone. The only catch is that the integration only works for the 20 million to 25 million people who are paying Spotify subscribers, not the ones using the free, ad-supported version of the service. That sort of makes sense, since the Echo doesn’t have any place to show the display ads that run on the free version of Spotify; on the other hand, Echo is integrated with Pandora, which also has display ads.\\n\\n\\nSoftware maker Atlassian\\'s revenue up 45 percent:\\xa0Australian Atlassian reported a 44.7 percent increase in quarterly revenue as more customers purchased its software that help companies collaborate and manage their operations. Net income inched up to $5.1 million in the second quarter ended Dec. 31 from $5.0 million a year earlier. On a per shares basis, profit was flat at 3 cents. Atlassian, which listed on the Nasdaq in December, said revenue rose to $109.7 million from $75.8 million. The company added more than 2,600 net new customers in the quarter.\\n\\n\\nIndian IT services growth seeng slowing:\\xa0Indian IT services exports are likely to grow at a slower pace next fiscal year than in the recent past as global clients rein in technology spending, an industry lobby group said on Thursday. The cutback on routine IT services is likely to push firms including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd to sharpen their focus on high-margin digital services, analytics and artificial intelligence to cushion the impact on earnings. India\\'s IT and software services export revenue is likely to grow by 10-12 percent in the fiscal year beginning on April 1 to as much as $121 billion, the National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) said. Exports in the current fiscal year ending March are estimated to grow 12.3 percent to $108 billion, at the lower end of Nasscom\\'s projection, with digital services seen up 19 percent. IT services growth seen slowing as clients curb spending. The shift towards new services could also trigger a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the sector, after Indian IT companies spent $2.4 billion on digital deals in 2015 - three times higher than the year before, Nasscom said. \"To acquire digital skills companies will have to re-skill employees and acquire new technologies and that is likely to continue,\" it said. Including domestic sales, total revenue of the Indian IT sector, which accounts for 9.3 percent of the country\\'s economic output, likely rose 8.3 percent to $143 billion in the fiscal year ending March 31, Nasscom said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLenovo Tumbles as Sputtering PC, Phone Demand Hammers Sales:\\xa0Lenovo Group Ltd. plunged in Hong Kong trading after quarterly revenue declined for the first time in more than six years on stalling demand for phones and computers. Shares fell 10 percent in their biggest decline in two years. The world’s largest PC maker said revenue dropped 8 percent in the three months ended December, even as broadening cost cuts delivered a surprise rise in net income. Lenovo is relying on cutting $1.35 billion from annual costs and eliminating 3,200 jobs to shield its earnings from intensifying smartphone competition and a shrinking market for PCs. While it’s expanding into other businesses, the company still gets more than half of revenue from a market that Intel Corp. last month warned was off to a “soft” start in 2016 amid tepid economic growth. Focusing internationally helped Lenovo lift the proportion of smartphone shipments from outside China to 83 percent from 59 percent. Expansion into markets from India to the U.S. helped shore up margins even as its global market share slipped about 1.5 percentage points to 5.1 percent in the period. The company once hailed as a symbol of global ambitions for Chinese corporations now faces the twin challenges of a competitive global smartphone and PC environment and a home country growing at its slowest pace in a quarter-century.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoPro forecasts revenue below estimates, names new CFO:\\xa0GoPro forecast current-quarter revenue well below analysts\\' estimates on weak demand for its wearable cameras and the company named Brian McGee as its new chief financial officer. GoPro said McGee, who joined the company from Qualcomm in 2015, would succeed Jack Lazar as CFO on March 11. The camera maker\\'s shares fell 10 percent in extended trading on Wednesday. Demand for GoPro\\'s helmet- and body-mounted cameras has been declining as rivals such as China\\'s Xiaomi XTC.UL offer cheaper products and smartphone cameras turn increasingly advanced. GoPro forecast revenue of $160 million to $180 million for the first quarter ending March. The company\\'s revenue fell 31 percent to $436.6 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, missing the average analyst estimate of $496.1 million. GoPro, which had already released its quarterly numbers last month, reported an adjusted loss of 8 cents per share. Analysts had expected the company to break even on a per-share basis. The company\\'s shares were trading at $9.72 after the bell. Up to Wednesday\\'s close, the stock had fallen more than 80 percent in the past 12 months.\\n\\n\\nCisco to pay $1.4 billion for Internet of Things firm Jasper:\\xa0Cisco Systems Inc said on Wednesday it was buying Jasper Technologies Inc, a startup that connects devices like cars and medical devices to the Internet, for $1.4 billion in cash and equity awards, its largest acquisition since 2013. Legacy technology companies like Cisco have been trying to find paths for growth while new technology developments, such as the rise of cloud computing, threaten their core businesses. The so called Internet of Things, the area Jasper specializes in, offers Cisco a chance to offer cutting-edge technology to its current customers such as telecommunications companies. Jasper connects devices like cars, jet engines and pacemakers to the Internet and also makes a software platform that helps monitor these devices once they are online. Jasper had been planning an initial public offering and had banks to help it prepare. Its investors such as Singapore\\'s Temasek, Sequoia Capital and Benchmark Capital, will now get a chance to cash out without having to brave the rocky equity markets which have seen no technology IPOs this year. Jasper\\'s chief executive Jahangir Mohammed will stay on with Cisco and run a new Internet of Things Software Business Unit once the deal closes in the third quarter.\\n\\n\\nDropbox May Not Be LeBron James, but It Is Still in the Game:\\xa0There are no obvious signs of distress at the lavish San Francisco headquarters of the cloud storage company Dropbox, where on any given day, its hallways bustle with upbeat, well-compensated tech workers enjoying the customary trappings of start-up life. Dropbox is not laying off workers or shrinking; it hired nearly 500 people last year, 75 since the start of this year, and it plans to soon move into a sprawling, custom-designed office building for which it has signed a long-term lease. But that isn’t the image of Dropbox you’d encounter in the news media. Two years ago, the company raised a round of financing that valued it at $10 billion, making it one of the most highly prized start-ups of the tech boom. Now it faces a stock market that has turned unfriendly to initial public offerings of tech companies, not to mention stiff competition from publicly traded companies like Microsoft, Google and Box, the similarly named firm in a similar line of business. As a result, Dropbox’s valuation has been battered by a series of “markdowns” from large investors who appear to have turned skeptical about its future. For instance, the mutual fund manager T. Rowe Price now considers Dropbox’s shares to be worth half what they were at the time of the last fund-raising round. So what’s really going on at Dropbox? Is it thriving or dying? Neither one, yet. When you look inside the company, you find something that defies Silicon Valley’s typical straight-up or straight-down narrative: a complicated story of incremental and potentially accelerating success, but one clouded by outsize dreams of yesteryear. It’s a fate that other Silicon Valley start-ups may be facing, especially with the dip in public and private markets for funding tech ventures. Dropbox’s problems have less to do with the strength of its current business than with a delay, so far, in realizing the towering expectations that once surrounded the company. The start-up is like the college basketball star who manages to turn pro but is still regarded with doubt because everyone has now realized he might never be the next LeBron James. What happens to a company once thought to be worth $10 billion when it turns out to be worth only $5 billion, or $2 billion? According to Dropbox’s executives, nothing too terrible — it can just wait out the market freeze and perhaps grow into its $10 billion valuation. In other words, Dropbox can keep working and may yet turn into LeBron. The murkier issue is not whether Dropbox can build a good business, but whether it can ever become the $10 billion goose that investors had once seen it as. Reports of Dropbox’s demise are premature. But so are reports of its comeback.\\n\\n\\nAmit Singhal, head of Search, to retire - will be repaced by head of AI:\\xa0Amit Singhal, the company’s senior vice president for search, and one of the earliest builders of its global computer system, announced that he would retire on Feb. 26. He has been involved with many of the technologies that have made Alphabet an engineering powerhouse and one of the world’s most valuable companies. His replacement, John Giannandrea, currently works in artificial intelligence, or A.I., at Alphabet. A.I. has been increasingly important to Google and other companies like Amazon, as they seek to build products that can do things like respond to voice commands, deliver complex alerts about changes to a user’s schedule, or drive a car. In a post to the Google Plus social network, Mr. Singhal indicated that he wished to spend time with his family and intended to give away some of his fortune. “It has always been a priority for me to give back to people who are less fortunate, and make time for my family,” he wrote. Mr. Singhal, 48, joined Google in 2000 as employee No. 176. A native of India, he has a doctorate in computer science from Cornell and worked at AT&T Labs before Google. One of his earliest jobs at Google was rewriting the initial breakthrough algorithms developed by Google’s co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Google was one of many search engines, but it distinguished itself both in the quality of its results and in building features like spell check, which could offer correct answers to misspelled queries. The early engineering team also developed search-related tools for its advertising, which quickly turned into a very profitable business. Unlike some other early Google employees who scaled back their efforts or left the company altogether, Mr. Singhal appeared to remain fully engaged in advancing search. In an interview last summer, he described his job as looking at “what’s beyond the horizon,” particularly in building ways that people can easily get information from mobile devices. Mr. Giannandrea, 50, came to Google from the 2010 acquisition of another company, Metaweb Technologies. He has played an important role in incorporating machine learning into various Google products, like the image recognition in Google Photos and smart replies in Gmail’s Inbox. In addition to Mr. Singhal’s stated philanthropic and family interests, it is likely that his skills in building large computer networks and in A.I. will still be in demand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMagic Leap, an Augmented Reality Firm, Raises $793 Million:\\xa0Magic Leap, a secretive augmented reality start-up based in Dania Beach, Fla., announced on Tuesday that it had raised a $793 million round of venture financing, valuing the company at $3.7 billion, excluding the new funds. The round comes during a race to discover and create the next breakout platform for consumers, which many of the world’s largest tech companies think will be some form of virtual reality. In 2014 Facebook paid $2 billion for Oculus, a virtual reality company that plans to ship its first headsets to consumers in the coming weeks. Microsoft has been working on Hololens, and Apple is reportedly at work on its own efforts. But Magic Leap has drawn attention for the prominent investors it has attracted — Google, Fidelity Investments and Warner Brothers, among others — despite being almost completely closed off from showing the public any of its products. Only occasionally do the founders pop up to give interviews. This most recent round was led by Alibaba, the large Chinese e-commerce company, with participation from new investors including J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Morgan Stanley Investment Management and T. Rowe Price Associates. Magic Leap has raised more than $1 billion in funding to date.\\n\\n\\n\\nImage Recognition Invades Shopping As Curalate Raises $27.5M:\\xa0Pinterest. Instagram. Tumblr. The future of the web is visual, but how does anyone make money on that? By understanding what’s in the images people post and connecting them to where you can buy what you see. That’s Curalate’s job. The image recognition marketing startup just raised $27.5 million led by NEA, bringing it to $40 million in total funding. If a picture is worth a thousand words, Curalate makes brands literate. Since Curalate is a suite of visual commerce tools rather than a single product, what the company actually does can seem a bit nebulous. Here’s a quick breakdown of what Curalate offers: \\xa0Like2Buy_home_cardLike2Buy – Turns the one link in a brand’s Instagram profile into a gateway to buy products from any of their Instagram posts. Fanreel – Pulls in user-generated images to a brand’s website and applies image recognition to tag products to show so they’re easy to buy. Visual Insights – Generates analytics about which of a brand’s products are being shared in images on Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr and other networks so businesses know what’s hot Reveal – Makes images on a business’ website shoppable by tagging the products in them and linking them to detail and purchase pages. Ads – Allows brands to buy ads on Instagram and Pinterest using additional proprietary targeting options.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon Is Said to Be Planning an Expansion Into Retail Bookstores:\\xa0\\xa0Amazon signs may be headed to more physical storefronts. The Internet retailer plans to open more brick-and-mortar bookstores following the unveiling last year of one such location here in its hometown, according to a person briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential plans. But the company’s plans for physical stores are modest, this person said, especially in comparison with reports of an expansion suggested by an unusual source, the chief of a large shopping mall operator. Sandeep Mathrani, chief executive of the mall operator General Growth Properties, was answering questions from analysts on Tuesday about foot traffic in malls when he said, of Amazon’s bookstore plans, “Their goal is to open, as I understand, 300 to 400 bookstores,” according to a recording of the call. Even if Amazon is not planning to go nationwide with its stores anytime soon, any expansion of its brick-and-mortar presence is likely to send shivers down the spines of other booksellers. Amazon’s success as an online retailer of physical and electronic books has already devastated chains like Borders and seriously wounded Barnes & Noble. Independent booksellers, though, are seeing sales growth in many parts of the country, showing how reluctant some book fans have been to give up browsing store shelves. “There are all kinds of studies that show the best way to find things when you don’t know what you’re looking for is an old-fashioned bookstore,” said John Mutter, editor in chief and co-founder of Shelf Awareness, which publishes an email newsletter for booksellers and librarians. “I think that’s a major part of what Amazon is trying to do with this bookstore in Seattle.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYahoo to look at job cuts, alongside spin-off:\\xa0 After its core Internet business has continued to flounder, Yahoo says it is now exploring “strategic alternatives,” which could imply a number of things — including selling off its core business to another company, as was previously reported. Basically, this is an acknowledgment that things are not working over at Yahoo proper. The company released its full-year earnings today that showed, once again, flat earnings growth, and a series of products that still haven’t breached mainstream stardom. All this, taken together, is something that has investors very displeased. The company also said it was laying off 15% of its staff, including closing some international offices — which TechCrunch previously reported — as it continues to figure out what its core business looks like in 2016. Following the report, the stock basically went nowhere, meaning all of this was baked into expectations for the company’s earnings report. Mayer dismissed accusations of excessive spending, denying what she called an inaccurate report of a $7 million bill for its holiday party, saying the figure was exaggerated by a factor of three. Yahoo reported a 15-percent drop in adjusted quarterly revenue - after deducting fees paid to partner websites - to $1.00 billion from $1.18 billion as it struggles to keep its share of online search and display advertising in the face of tough competition.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlphabet, Google’s Parent Company, Grows Briskly to Close in on Apple:\\xa0Wall Street got its first glimpse of the financial details of a new conglomerate called Alphabet on Monday. Investors liked what they saw so much that the outfit formerly known as Google is poised to become the world’s most valuable company. Alphabet’s total revenue, barring currency fluctuations, increased 24 percent to $21.3 billion, when compared with the same period in 2014. Shares of Alphabet were up more than 5 percent in after-hours trading. Google was notorious for its indifference to Wall Street. But Alphabet has been a model student, reining in its expenses, using $5 billion of its $73 billion cash hoard to repurchase company stock and, with this latest report, giving investors more insight into how Google’s core business is performing. The new disclosures, combined with its more investor-friendly tone and, of course, continued strong growth in its advertising business, are the main reasons Alphabet stock has jumped 43 percent from a year ago, putting it neck and neck with Apple as the most valuable company in the world. The benefit of segment reporting for Alphabet and other high-growth Internet companies is that when investors are allowed to take an unvarnished look at how profitable one side of the business is, it tends to make them more forgiving of losses elsewhere. Or at least that was what happened with Amazon, which recently began separating its retail operations from the results of its highly profitable cloud computing business, and Netflix, which used segment reporting to show investors that while it might be losing money internationally, its North American streaming business is doing well. Advertising continues to account for the lion’s share of the company’s revenue, and search advertising is about three-quarters of total revenue, according to estimates by Mr. Mahaney. For now, most everything investors are excited about also has to do with advertising. This includes YouTube, whose annual revenue is now estimated at somewhere from $4 billion to $8 billion, and the Google Play store, Google’s mobile app store, which takes a cut of app revenue but recently started selling in-store advertisements.\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle’s Moonshots Cost Lots of Money, but Running Google Costs Even More:\\xa0For years, Larry Page told Wall Street he wasn’t blowing all of Google’s money on crazy bets like self-driving cars and smart contact lenses. Turns out, he was right. If the first dual-structure Alphabet earnings showed us anything, it’s that the biggest costs for the Internet giant are not from its various non-Google projects. They’re from Google itself. Case in point: In 2015, capital expenditure — servers, real estate and stuff like that — ran $8.85 billion for Google’s core business. Cap ex for the Alphabet remainder — from the self-driving cars to the Fiber broadband business to two biotech companies — was far less, at $869 million. Operating loss for those units was just north of $3 billion. That is, Google spent more than twice as much on its basic ad business than on its change-the-world projects. The reason? Running core Google is still expensive — particularly the massive data server infrastructure, which remains part of Google. So is its very large and very expensive research division, despite the fact that lots of that work, like its artificial intelligence and VR efforts, end up in other Alphabet projects, such as autonomous vehicles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle Parent To Overtake Apple as World\\'s Most Valuable Company:\\xa0Google parent Alphabet Inc. is poised to become the world’s most valuable company, taking the crown away from Silicon Valley rival Apple Inc. after reporting higher profit and sales fueled by a booming advertising business that’s supporting ambitious new projects. Alphabet’s shares jumped as much as 9.4 percent in extended trading, putting it on track to surpass Apple’s market capitalization of $534.7 billion. The Web company has been inching closer to the iPhone maker as investors lose confidence in Apple’s smartphone business and wager that Alphabet has a clearer path to growth. Apple first passed oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp. as the world’s most valuable company in 2011. By changing its name and structure last year, Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Larry Page has put the focus on the company’s main Web business while giving more insight into investments in new areas such as artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, health technology and fast Internet access. Even though Apple has also been building expertise in cars and AI, the secretive company has kept much of that under wraps. With iPhone sales slowing and China’s growth engine sputtering, Apple is on pace to post its first revenue decline in 15 years. Alphabet sales are estimated to climb 16 percent this year. The shares of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet rose to $843 in extended trading from $770.77 at the close in New York, suggesting that the Web company’s market capitalization will exceed $550 billion when trading resumes on Tuesday. While Apple generates more than triple the revenue and profit of Google, investors focus more on future prospects than past performance. It’s a market truism that’s particularly acute in the technology industry, where new breakthroughs can rapidly undercut previously reliable business models. Apple and Alphabet’s ascendance to half-trillion-dollar-plus valuations illustrates the premium investors put on U.S. technology companies. Five of the nine most valuable companies in the world are from the industry -- Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon.com.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvernote Will Shut Down Market, Its E-Commerce Effort, On Wednesday:\\xa0\\xa0Some more news from Evernote — the note-taking app and startup of the same name — that speaks to the company’s current rough patch: today it announced that as of Wednesday at 6pm Pacific, it will shutter Market, the e-commerce platform where it sold Evernote swag and Evernote-integrated office products, in an attempt to create another revenue stream around its more dedicated users. Separately, we’ve also learned that there is another senior departure at the company: Ronda Scott, the company’s longtime head of comms, is leaving at the end of this week. The moves come at what has been a pretty difficult period for the startup. Developments have included a number of senior departures, including that of the previous, longtime CEO Phil Libin; other underperforming products getting axed, and the startup — once commanding a $1 billion tag — among several whose valuations have more recently been marked down by large fund managers. In a blog post announcing the news today, head of partnerships John Hoye wrote that the move is being made as part of Evernote’s restructuring around its core business as a software — not e-commerce — company. Evernote is a startup based around keeping documents in the cloud — and eliminating the need for paper. So when the Market and its focus on notebooks and other products was introduced in 2013, it did feel a little out of left field. A year after that the company said it had sold some $12 million in goods through the store. And today it updated that with other numbers: over 800,000 Evernote Moleskine notebooks, 300,000 Jot Script styluses and nearly 20,000 ScanSnap Evernote Edition scanners. But at the end of the day, it seems those numbers did not really meet the costs of maintaining the operation. So now that Evernote is calling time on all frivolities; trying to get back to the heart of what made the startup so popular in the first place; and driving more premium users — which are up 40% on a year ago, a spokesperson tells me — the decision to shut the Market was probably an easy sell at the startup.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft Plumbs Ocean’s Depths to Test Underwater Data Center:\\xa0Microsoft has tested a prototype of a self-contained data center that can operate hundreds of feet below the surface of the ocean, eliminating one of the technology industry’s most expensive problems: the air-conditioning bill. Today’s data centers, which power everything from streaming video to social networking and email, contain thousands of computer servers generating lots of heat. When there is too much heat, the servers crash. Putting the gear under cold ocean water could fix the problem. It may also answer the exponentially growing energy demands of the computing world because Microsoft is considering pairing the system either with a turbine or a tidal energy system to generate electricity. The effort, code-named Project Natick, might lead to strands of giant steel tubes linked by fiber optic cables placed on the seafloor. Another possibility would suspend containers shaped like jelly beans beneath the surface to capture the ocean current with turbines that generate electricity. Such a radical idea could run into stumbling blocks, including environmental concerns and unforeseen technical issues. But the Microsoft researchers believe that by mass producing the capsules, they could shorten the deployment time of new data centers from the two years it now takes on land to just 90 days, offering a huge cost advantage. The underwater server containers could also help make web services work faster. Much of the world’s population now lives in urban centers close to oceans but far away from data centers usually built in out-of-the-way places with lots of room. The ability to place computing power near users lowers the delay, or latency, people experience, which is a big issue for web users. The company recently completed a 105-day trial of a steel capsule — eight feet in diameter — that was placed 30 feet underwater in the Pacific Ocean off the Central California coast near San Luis Obispo. Controlled from offices here on the Microsoft campus, the trial proved more successful than expected. The researchers had worried about hardware failures and leaks. The underwater system was outfitted with 100 different sensors to measure pressure, humidity, motion and other conditions to better understand what it is like to operate in an environment where it is impossible to send a repairman in the middle of the night. The system held up. That led the engineers to extend the time of the experiment and to even run commercial data-processing projects from Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing service.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTech Valuations In 2016: The End Of The Line For Sloppy Growth:\\xa0What’s going on in technology investing right now? Is this another 2001, when tech imploded? Another 2008, when the wider world crashed but tech powered through? Or is it like Facebook in 2012, a valuation blip and a chance to buy? High-growth companies have attracted \\xa0high valuations, which allowed them to raise capital, which was then spent to generate still more growth and raise the valuation again. The result has been a self-perpetuating cycle of high burn, higher growth, still higher valuations and a strong positive feedback loop. The slop has been showing up in the numbers. The valuations of public companies already reflect this - valuations of public tech companies crashed 18 months ago. In March 2014, these high-growth companies were being valued at 12x run-rate revenues, but by mid-2014, this had declined to around 6x revenues, which is where it has remained since. The long-expected crash has, in fact, already happened — almost 18 months ago. \\xa0Unlike the private markets, the public markets get to rethink investment decisions every day. Over time, public investors either explicitly or implicitly realized that customer economics and the quality of growth have declined and, consequently, reduced the premium paid for excess growth. Capitalism works. The private markets, where decisions only get made once a year, have been slower to react; hence, the dearth of IPOs and the price adjustments seen as high-priced private companies come to the public markets. In 2016, any private tech company where the last percentage points of growth have only been generated at the expense of profit will no longer be able to attract capital at a high valuation. Smart companies will respond by cutting marginal investment, thus raising sales efficiency — even at the expense of having a lower growth rate. We will then see the same feedback loop kick in, but in reverse. Lower valuations will result in less capital being raised, which will result in lower growth and still-lower valuations. In contrast to the rise, the decline will happen much more quickly. Bubbles build up slowly, crashes happen fast. Eventually it will bottom out as growth rates become sustainable at acceptable levels of customer economics. Sloppy growth will be out. Sustainable, smart growth will be back — at least until the next time.\\n\\n\\nTheranos is running out of time:\\xa0When Elizabeth Holmes, chief executive officer of Theranos Inc., sat down for an interview last month, she sought to address reports that sparked serious doubts about her company\\'s innovative blood-testing technology. “What we need to do now is focus on the technology and focus on the science and the data and put that out there,” Holmes said in an interview for a Bloomberg Businessweek cover story. “Because that speaks for itself.”: Since then, investors, critics, and members of the medical community have been waiting. And waiting. And the news just keeps getting worse. The most recent blow comes from an inspection report by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which found that Theranos\\'s lab facility in Newark, Calif., is in violation of regulations on five counts. As Bloomberg News reported, the company\\'s testing center inside a Walgreen\\'s pharmacy in Palo Alto, Calif., has been temporarily shuttered and turned into a ghost town with a sign taped out front saying it\\'s closed \"until further notice.\" The company\\'s response to this new crisis is the same as it has been all along: It says it is on top of it. How much longer it can keep saying this without losing its credibility is unclear, but it\\'s safe to say that time is running out.Holmes and her story of upending the blood testing market were so powerful that Theranos was granted a $9 billion valuation through recent investment rounds and attracted a VIP roster of politically connected board members from outside the medical field, such as Henry Kissinger and William Perry. Theranos did much of its fundraising from 2003 to 2015, in the midst of an inflating Silicon Valley bubble, when billions of dollars in investor money was sloshing around. The environment has become much more difficult over the past six months, and the company may be running out of time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon shares plunge as record profit still misses estimates:\\xa0Amazon.com Inc posted its most profitable quarter ever on Thursday but the world\\'s No. 1 online retailer still managed to disappoint Wall Street by badly missing estimates, sending its shares down more than 13 percent in after-hours trading. The results, as well as the company\\'s determination to invest more in new areas and its extremely low profit margins, brought back perennial questions for investors about the company\\'s ability to consistently earn money. Amazon\\'s net profit for the fourth quarter, which includes the holiday shopping season, rose to $482 million, or $1.00 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, up from $214 million, or 45 cents per share, a year earlier. Net sales rose 21.8 percent to $35.75 billion, but missed analysts\\' expectations of $35.93 billion. Net sales from its cloud services business, Amazon Web Services, rose 69.4 percent to $2.41 billion, compared with a growth of more than 78 percent in the third quarter. AWS continues to be the fastest growing division within Amazon. The company\\'s total operating expenses rose more than 20 percent to $34.64 billion in the fourth quarter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft beats Wall Street view on high demand for cloud products:\\xa0Microsoft Corp reported quarterly revenue and profit that beat analysts\\' expectations, driven by aggressive cost cutting and growing demand for its cloud products and services.Total revenue, however, fell 10.1 percent to $23.80 billion, squeezed by a strong dollar as well as a weak personal computer market that has reduced demand for Microsoft\\'s Windows operating system. On an adjusted basis, revenue fell to $25.69 billion but beat analysts\\' estimates. Microsoft generates more than half of its revenue from outside the United States. Microsoft\\'s net income fell to $5 billion, or 62 cents per share, in its second-quarter ended Dec. 31 from $5.86 billion, or 71 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue from the \"intelligent cloud\" business, which includes products such as its Azure cloud infrastructure and services business along with other non-cloud products such as traditional servers, rose 5 percent to $6.3 billion. Perhaps a better indicator of its cloud strength is what the company calls its combined cloud business, on track for $9.4 billion in annual revenue, the company said. That measure, which includes Azure plus other businesses like Office 365, is up 15 percent from the $8.2 billion revenue it estimated last quarter. \"They nailed the cloud,\" said Matt Howard, a venture capitalist at Norwest Ventures who monitors Microsoft closely.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba Falls as Sales Volume Slows, Adding to China Concern:\\xa0Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. shares fell after the Chinese online retailer reported flagging growth in sales on its marketplaces, adding to concerns about the country’s economic slowdown. The shares dropped 3.8 percent to $66.92 in New York, bringing their loss for the year to 18 percent. While gross merchandise volume on Alibaba’s Chinese retail marketplaces rose 22 percent to 964 billion yuan ($147 billion) in the three months ended December 31, that’s less than the 28 percent increase in the prior quarter.\\xa0 Revenue and earnings per share beat analysts’ estimates in the fourth quarter because Alibaba was able to sell more ads to its merchants and better capitalize on its Tmall and Taobao platforms, he said. What’s troubling is the decelerated growth in GMV, most worryingly at Tmall, where it was 37 percent this quarter, compared with 56 percent growth the previous period, Cordwell said. Plus, the boost in sales from advertising came from Alibaba catching up on monetizing its mobile platforms, a phenomenon that will end, he said. Sales of 34.5 billion yuan ($5.2 billion) rose 32%, and outpaced expectations for a 27-percent rise. The proportion of revenue Alibaba gets from outside China fell to 6 percent\\xa0\\n\\n\\nFacebook to Shut Down Parse, Its Platform for Mobile Developers:\\xa0Facebook acquired Parse, a toolkit and support system for mobile developers, in 2013. At the time, the social network’s ambitions were high: Parse would be Facebook’s way into one day harnessing developers to become a true cloud business, competing alongside the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft. Those ambitions, it seems, have fallen back to earth. On Thursday, Facebook said it plans to shut down Parse, the services platform for which it paid upwards of a reported $85 million. At one point, Facebook was willing to take those risks. When Facebook bought Parse in 2013, Facebook’s stock was below its initial public offering price of $38. The company had not grown a robust mobile advertising yet, and Facebook was eager to seek out other lines of business in hopes of future profits, according to two people with knowledge of the company’s plans at the time who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak for the company. Parse seemed like a good opportunity for expansion. At the time, Internet businesses were in the midst of a major industry change, as users were shifting away from desktop computing and increasingly relying on mobile devices. Parse, the thinking went, could provide Facebook the opportunity to be the foundation of a whole new generation of developers building mobile apps in the age of the smartphone. Things have changed. Facebook is generating record profits and its mobile advertising business is booming; 80 percent of the company’s advertising revenue now comes from mobile devices. As Facebook’s fortunes have turned, it has shown less interest in pursuing other lines of business outside of what it does best. Instead, the company appears intent on building things that somehow, someday, will feed Facebook’s core ad-based business — and those bets are going to have to get bigger and weirder Facebook also would have had to invest untold millions of dollars in capital and, more importantly, engineering talent, to get the Parse business fully off the ground to have a better chance at making a dent in competitors like Amazon, Microsoft and Google.\\n\\n\\nWalgreens Halts Use Of Theranos’ California Lab:\\xa0More bad news for blood analysis startup Theranos – Walgreens has suspended use of the company’s Newark, California lab, following news the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said that lab posed “immediate jeopardy” to patients. Walgreens partners with Theranos, allowing the startup to collect blood draws out of many of the drug store’s Arizona locations and one in Palo Alto. The blood samples are then sent to Theranos labs. Walgreens sent a statement to explain the action: \"In light of the letter dated Jan. 25 from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to Theranos, Inc., Walgreens said today that it has informed Theranos that it must immediately cease sending any clinical laboratory tests provided through Theranos Wellness Centers at Walgreens to the Theranos lab in Newark, Calif., for analysis.

Facebook shares rose almost 12 percent in after-hours trading to $105.32. The company said sales in the fourth quarter rose 52 percent from a year ago, to $5.84 billion, while profit increased to $1.56 billion, more than doubling from $701 million a year ago. For the full year, the company reported $3.69 billion in profit on $17.93 billion in revenue, an increase of 44 percent from 2014. The company has also begun monetizing some of its other units, such as photo-sharing app Instagram, which surpassed 400 million users last year and began selling ads in September. Facebook said mobile ads accounted for 80 percent of total ad revenue in the quarter, compared with about 78 percent in the third quarter and 69 percent a year earlier.The results offer a bright spot in a tumultuous climate for many American technology stocks. Shares of Twitter, Facebook’s most visible social networking competitor in the United States, have tumbled more than 55 percent during the last year. Yelp, the local-review service, is down about 60 percent. LinkedIn, the professional social networking service, is off more than 15 percent. Facebook is a much larger company than many of its peers, yet it is able to keep its growth rate high. The company has notched double-digit jumps in ad revenue and in the expansion of its user base. Facebook now has 1.59 billion monthly visitors, up 14 percent from a year ago. About 1.44 billion of those people visit the site on a mobile device; 1.04 billion visit Facebook every day.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nEBay\\'s disappointing forecast fuels stock decline:\\xa0EBay forecast weaker-than-expected revenue and profit for the current quarter and full year, as the e-commerce company struggles against a strong dollar while trying to revamp its core marketplace business. Shares of the retailer fell more than 12 percent to $23.51 in extended trading on Wednesday. The online retailer, which faces intense competition from e-commerce giant Amazon.com, has also been hit by brick-and-mortar rivals like Wal-Mart Stores that are aggressively boosting their online presence. The company said its gross merchandise value, or the total value of all goods sold on its site, rose 5 percent after accounting for foreign exchange impact. In its second quarter without PayPal, eBay\\'s revenue was $2.32 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, flat with a year earlier during the crucial holiday shopping season and in line with analysts\\' average expectations. EBay began testing a paid shipping membership program in Germany last year, responding to shoppers\\' increased demand for faster delivery. Wenig on Wednesday said there were \"no plans for now\" to expand the program. EBay derives nearly 60 percent of its revenue from overseas and faces headwinds from a strong dollar.\\n\\n\\nPayPal\\'s revenue beats Street view on higher transactions, customers:\\xa0Revenue rose about 17 percent to $2.56 billion. \\xa0Payment processor PayPal Holdings Inc on Wednesday reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue, as new customer additions and payment processing volumes surged, and it announced a buyback of $2 billion of its stock. PayPal said it expects 2016 full-year earnings of $1.09 to $1.14 per share, and revenue growth of 16-19 percent on a currency neutral basis. It expects currency fluctuations to impact net revenue by 3 percentage points during the year. The company\\'s share buyback program was a reminder of the strength of its free cash flow. PayPal ended the year with $5.7 billion in cash reserves. PayPal\\'s net income rose to $367 million, or 30 cents per share, from $286 million, or 23 cents per share. Shares of PayPal, which completed its spin-off from eBay Inc in July, rose 6.4 percent to $33.66 in extended trade.\\n\\n\\nSamsung Electronics warns of difficult 2016 as smartphone market peaks:\\xa0\\xa0Tech giant Samsung on Thursday warned of possible weaker earnings this year compared with 2015 due to softer sales of gadgets such as smartphones, a trend that is also hurting rival Apple and major chipmakers. The South Korean firm\\'s warning came a day after Apple shares fell more than 6.5 percent, the biggest percentage drop in two years, as the iPhone maker forecast its first quarterly sales drop in 13 years.\\n\\n\\nQualcomm forecasts weak profit as demand slows for mobile chips:\\xa0\\xa0Qualcomm forecast current-quarter profit below analysts\\' expectations as demand weakens for its chips used in mobile devices in a slowing market. Revenue fell 18.7 percent to $5.78 billion. The company, whose customers include Apple, said it expected its mobile chip shipments to fall by 16-25 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier. Qualcomm also expects 3G and 4G device shipments to decline by 4-14 percent, hurting its licensing revenue. The chipmaker\\'s weak outlook comes a day after Apple forecast its first quarterly revenue drop in 13 years and reported the slowest-ever rise in iPhone shipments as the critical Chinese market shows signs of weakness. Qualcomm shares fell 3 percent in extended trading on Wednesday.\\n\\n\\nGoogle ships five million Cardboard virtual reality devices:\\xa0Alphabet\\'s Google said it had shipped 5 million units of the Google Cardboard viewer, a wearable device that allows users to experience virtual reality through mobile apps. Oculus, the virtual reality company Facebook Inc (FB.O) bought in 2014, started accepting pre-orders this month for its much-awaited headset, Rift, which will ship in first quarter. Google said in November that its video-sharing site, YouTube, supported virtual reality videos. Viewers can watch virtual reality videos using a mobile device and the Google Cardboard viewer. Google said more than 350,000 hours of YouTube videos had been watched in virtual reality.\\n\\n\\nTheranos Lab Poses ‘Immediate Jeopardy to Patient Health,’ Says U.S. Agency:\\xa0\\xa0The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has decided that Theranos’ Newark, Calif., facility poses “immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety.” A letter sent to the company on January 25th says that the lab has been given 10 days to provide “acceptable evidence of correction.” Specifically, the document cites problems with the laboratory director, the technical supervisor, hematology and the lab’s analytic systems. CMS has not released the laboratory inspection report that led to this letter, so the details of these infractions remain unclear. But the level assigned to these determinations — “Condition-level deficiencies” — are among the most serious that CMS can make. They mean that Theranos’ Newark lab was found to be in violation of accepted professional standards. CMS declined to comment on the letter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple sees first sales dip in more than a decade as super-growth era falters:\\xa0Revenue increased 1.7 percent to $75.87 billion. Apple forecast its first revenue drop in 13 years and reported the slowest-ever increase in iPhone shipments as the critical Chinese market showed signs of weakening, suggesting the technology company\\'s period of exponential growth may be ending.Apple\\'s guidance for the March quarter implies iPhone sales of 50 million to 52 million units in the March quarter, which would mark the company\\'s first-ever decline in sales of the gadget In the same quarter last year Apple sold 61.2 million iPhones. The company reported revenue of $18.37 billion from Greater China, accounting for 24.2 percent of total revenue. Revenue from the region had nearly doubled in the fourth quarter. Apple forecast second-quarter revenue of $50 billion to $53 billion, below analysts\\' average forecast of $55.5 billion. In the same quarter last year Apple reported revenue of $58 billion. While revenue in Greater China rose 14 percent in the last quarter, Apple is beginning to see a shift in the economy, particularly in Hong Kong, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters in an interview. \"As we move into the March quarter it\\'s becoming more apparent that there are some signs of economic softness,\" Maestri said. \"We are starting to see something that we have not seen before.\" The slowdown comes as Wall Street analysts worry the company does not have another blockbuster product to replace the iPhone. Apple does not report Watch sales, but it does not appear to have the makings of being a hit on the same level as the iPhone a year after launch. And while the company is reportedly working on a car, what it plans to do in that area and when are still unclear. The company\\'s shares, which have fallen 5 percent this year, bounced around in after-hours trading and were down more than 2.6 percent. \\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChina May No Longer Be Apple’s Great Firewall:\\xa0The iPhone maker is feeling the effects of an economic slowdown in its most important market.\\xa0China has been one of Apple\\'s most reliable\\xa0strongholds during its historic stretch of technology dominance. Even when sales began to level out in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, China was a buffer, promising a massive market of newly middle-class customers looking for a high-end, brand-name smartphone. Sales in Greater China grew 84 percent to $58.7 billion in 2015, making it the company\\'s second-biggest market after the U.S. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook showered the region with praise at the time for its importance to the company\\'s future. Apple\\'s reliance on the country is now being put to the test. On a conference call with analysts after its Tuesday earnings report, Cook said the company is beginning to see \"economic softness\" in the region, particularly in Hong Kong. China is no longer able to offset sluggishness elsewhere or counter the broader slowdown in the global smartphone market. Even with the Chinese New Year shopping season approaching, Apple is projecting its first quarterly sales decline since 2003.\\n\\n\\nApple’s iPhone Grows Finally Flatlines: 0.4% Yearly With 75 Million Units Sold In Q1:\\xa0Apple today reported sales of 74.8 million iPhones, 16.1 million iPads, and 5.3 million Macs in its Q1 earnings report today. Apple’s first quarter includes holiday sales, as the three-month period ends December 31, 2015. As such, it was supposed to be one of Cupertino’s best qrters of the year. Plus, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus both went live on September 25, meaning that Apple’s next-gen flagship devices were available for the whole of this quarter. Last year at the same time, Apple sold nearly 75 million units of the iPhone, which represented 57 percent revenue growth from the year before. This quarter’s sales of 74.8 million iPhones puts yearly revenue growth at just one percent for the category, and device sale growth at 0.4 percent. In terms of quarterly growth, Apple sold 56 percent more iPhones from last quarter’s 48 million. Apple was expected to sell at least 75 million units of the iPhone this year, a forecast that analysts have had a very close eye on during the course of the quarter. Many fear that the iPhone may finally start declining after nearly eight solid years of growth. On the other side of the spectrum, Apple is having more difficulty cultivating the iPad line of products. The company sold 16.1 million iPads in the first quarter, down 25 percent year-over-year, but up 63 percent from last quarter. Meanwhile, the PC industry as a whole has been steadily slowing, and Apple is no exception. Apple sold 5.3 million units of the Mac, down four percent from last year.\\n\\n\\nApple TV And Apple Watch (Probably) Had A Big Quarter:\\xa0\\xa0Apple’s “other” category makes it difficult to assess how many Apple Watches and TVs were purchased. What we do know is that the $4.35 billion in the “other” category saw a big jump — not just 62 percent annually, but up 43 percent since the last quarter. This means that there was a spike in sales months after the initial Apple Watch release in April. This could be because of increased holiday sales or a popular fourth generation Apple TV. Beats headphones and iPods are also included in \\xa0“other.” Without giving specific sales numbers, CEO Tim Cook said on the earnings call that it was the “best quarter by far for Apple TV sales.” There are 3,600 apps available for the TV now, he said. \\xa0Cook added that the company “set a new quarterly record for Apple Watch sales…especially strong sales in the month of December.” Apple has never released specific Watch sales numbers. Asymco analyst Horace Dediu updated his Apple Watch projections \"My estimate on Watch sales is about 5.5 million units during Q4. 12.4 million to date\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSoftware maker VMware to cut 800 jobs, sees weak 2016:\\xa0VMware Inc forecast 2016 revenue and profit below analysts\\' expectations, suggesting the software maker\\'s strong growth in new businesses was not enough to compensate for weakness in its traditional server-virtualization software. VMWare, like many technology providers, is struggling to keep pace with its customers\\' efforts to move key computing infrastructure to the cloud, meaning remote data centers. VMware shares fell 5 percent in extended trading on Tuesday, while EMC shares declined 1.4 percent. The company, whose flagship product helps customers cut costs by running multiple operating systems on a single server, has been hurt by slowing economic growth in markets outside the United States, which account for nearly half of its revenue. In particular, it cited weak bookings for its software in China, Russia, and Brazil. But the company noted some bright spots in newer businesses, such as NSX, which makes networking more efficient. That business is on track to generate $600 million annually, VMWare said, up from $200 million a year ago. The company\\'s net income rose 14.4 percent to $373 million, or 88 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, helped by a 12.6 percent jump in its services revenue. Revenue increased 9.7 percent to $1.87 billion, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.85 billion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA Personality Profile of Larry Page: How Larry Page’s Obsessions Became Google’s Business:\\xa0Three years ago, Charles Chase, an engineer who manages Lockheed Martin’s nuclear fusion program, was sitting on a white leather couch at Google’s Solve for X conference when a man he had never met knelt down to talk to him. They spent 20 minutes discussing how much time, money and technology separated humanity from a sustainable fusion reaction — that is, how to produce clean energy by mimicking the sun’s power — before Mr. Chase thought to ask the man his name. “I’m Larry Page,” the man said. He realized he had been talking to Google’s billionaire co-founder and chief executive. “He didn’t have any sort of pretension like he shouldn’t be talking to me or ‘Don’t you know who you’re talking to?’” Mr. Chase said. “We just talked.” Larry Page is not a typical chief executive, and in many of the most visible ways, he is not a C.E.O. at all. Corporate leaders tend to spend a good deal of time talking at investor conferences or introducing new products on auditorium stages. Mr. Page, who is 42, has not been on an earnings call since 2013, and the best way to find him at Google I/O — an annual gathering where the company unveils new products — is to ignore the main stage and follow the scrum of fans and autograph seekers who mob him in the moments he steps outside closed doors. But just because he has faded from public view does not mean he is a recluse. He is a regular at robotics conferences and intellectual gatherings like TED. Scientists say he is a good bet to attend Google’s various academic gatherings, like Solve for X and Sci Foo Camp, where he can be found having casual conversations about technology or giving advice to entrepreneurs.\\n\\n\\nSoftBank\\'s Slide Leaves It Worth Less Than Stake in Alibaba:\\xa0SoftBank tumbled below the value of its stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. amid growing concerns about the Japanese company’s other assets, including struggling U.S. wireless carrier Sprint. SoftBank’s market capitalization stood at 5.89 trillion yen ($50 billion) Friday after its stock rebounded 8 percent after a four-day losing streak triggered by rising pessimism about Sprint’s ability to pay down debt. That still lags the $56 billion that its stake in Alibaba is worth, according to its own website. \\xa0Billionaire Masayoshi Son has struggled to turn around Sprint since buying a controlling stake in 2013 for SoftBank’s biggest acquisition ever. The wireless operator lost its place as the third-largest U.S. carrier to T-Mobile US Inc. and its stock this week fell to the lowest level in more than two years. Its bonds led declines among junk-rated debt Wednesday. “It’s symbolic because it tells you that investors feel SoftBank has been destroying value,” said Amir Anvarzadeh, a manager of Japanese equity sales at BGC Partners Inc. in Singapore. “Son’s pride has been another major issue, which pushed him to where he is now.” SoftBank lists the value of holdings in nine other public companies on its website, including Sprint and Yahoo Japan. The company calculated the total market value of those holdings as more than 8 trillion yen.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBig Exec Departures at Twitter:\\xa0Media Head Stanton and Product Head Weil Leaving: In a major executive upheaval, two of Twitter’s top executives — media head Katie Jacobs Stanton and product head Kevin Weil — are departing the company, according to sources close to the situation. Neither has immediate plans to go to another company, added sources, but are expected to. Right now, the jobs of both Weil and Stanton will be filled with interim replacements. There have been rumblings of the changes for weeks now inside the San Francisco social communications company. Sources said Twitter is planning to announce the shuffle tomorrow, along with the hire of a prominent CMO.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacing a Price War, Uber Bets on Volume: The U.S. operation cuts fares while promising imminent profit.\\xa0It’s becoming a bit of a holiday tradition for Uber: ringing in the new year by lowering fares. Amid a price war with rival Lyft, the ride-hailing leader reduced its rates by 10 percent to 45 percent in 100 cities across North America. In Detroit, Uber drivers’ per-mile rate is less than it takes to cover their gas and the depreciation of their cars, according to IRS figures. “It’s depressing,” says Bill Scroggins, an Uber driver in Indianapolis. “I’m not even sure I want to drive anymore. It feels like I’m doing it for free.” This is the third year in a row Uber has discounted fares in January. It calls the cuts seasonal but says they could last indefinitely. Last year rates never rose again in almost a third of cities; only in two did they return to precut prices. Uber has instituted temporary hourly wage guarantees to limit drivers’ earnings declines. It’s assured Scroggins and other outraged drivers they’ll come out ahead by making more trips an hour thanks to increased demand. That may be what Uber is telling itself, too. A few months ago, Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick told employees that North American operations would turn a profit in the second quarter of this year. The goal sounds less realistic in light of the price cuts. “Uber has to sacrifice profits for growth,” says Evan Rawley, a professor at Columbia Business School. Uber is also churning through cash a lot faster than Lyft, having said it will spend billions to push its way into China, India, and Southeast Asia. In the first quarter of 2015, Uber lost $385.1 million on $287.3 million in revenue, according to leaked figures published by the Information, a tech news site. And losses are growing: In the third quarter, Uber lost $697 million on $498 million in revenue, according to a person briefed on the numbers. Over the first three quarters of 2015, Uber lost $1.7 billion on $1.2 billion in revenue. For perspective, during Amazon.com’s worst-ever four quarters, in 2000, it lost $1.4 billion on $2.8 billion in revenue. CEO Jeff Bezos responded by firing more than 15 percent of his workforce.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle Paid Apple $1 Billion to Keep Search Bar on IPhone:\\xa0Google Inc. is paying Apple Inc. a hefty fee to keep its search bar on the iPhone. Apple received $1 billion from its rival in 2014, according to a transcript of court proceedings from Oracle Corp.’s copyright lawsuit against Google. The search engine giant has an agreement with Apple that gives the iPhone maker a percentage of the revenue Google generates through the Apple device, an attorney for Oracle said at a Jan. 14 hearing in federal court. Rumors about how much Google pays Apple to be on the iPhone have circulated for years, but the companies have never publicly disclosed it. Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Apple, and Google spokesman Aaron Stein both declined to comment on the information disclosed in court. The revenue-sharing agreement reveals the lengths Google must go to keep people using its search tool on mobile devices. It also shows how Apple benefits financially from Google’s advertising-based business model that Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has criticized as an intrusion of privacy. Oracle has been fighting Google since 2010 over claims that the search engine company used its Java software without paying for it to develop Android. The showdown has returned to U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco after a pit stop at the U.S. Supreme Court, where Google lost a bid to derail the case. The damages Oracle now seeks may exceed $1 billion since it expanded its claims to cover newer Android versions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSeeking Twitter\\'s territory,\\xa0Facebook launches real-time sports platform:\\xa0Facebook Inc is tackling the sports arena with a new platform called Facebook Sports Stadium, which the social media site said will provide real-time updates on games, popular posts from fans, statistics and commentary from experts. \"With 650 million sports fans, Facebook is the world\\'s largest stadium,\" it wrote in a post on Wednesday announcing the feature. The new service appears to be an effort to encroach on Twitter\\'s territory. The micro-blogging site has long been a popular destination for so-called \"live-tweeting\" games. MichaelAaron Flicker, president of XenoPsi, a New York City-based marketing firm, said the new product is Facebook\\'s attempt at capturing \"in the moment\" engagement. \"They don\\'t have that piece of the puzzle,\" Flicker said. \"The challenge for Facebook is there are already a lot of communities (like Facebook Sports Stadium). This is not a unique offering.\"\\n\\n\\nJack Dorsey Juggles Twitter and Square, Both Caught in Downdraft:\\xa0It is not shaping up as a happy new year for Jack Dorsey and his two companies. Even as the stock market’s volatility has dragged down many businesses, Mr. Dorsey and the public tech companies that he runs as chief executive — Twitter, the social network, and Square, the mobile payments company — have been particularly buffeted.Shares of Twitter hit a record low early Wednesday before going on a wild ride and rising 4.1 percent for the day. The gain did little to erase Twitter’s negative trajectory, with its shares off 25 percent this year. Square, which went public last November, fell below its initial public offering price of $9 for the first time on Wednesday before recovering. In total, the stock is down 28 percent this year. Square faces its own set of difficulties. Naysayers have long questioned the profit margins on the company’s payments processing business. Square takes a small cut of every credit card payment it processes, a cut that is split with banks and other financial intermediaries. The company has expanded into other areas in recent years, such as food delivery and capital extensions to small businesses. Square also is dealing with a relatively small proportion of shares available for trading, since the company sold less than 10 percent of itself in its public offering, in what is known as a “small float” offering. Also, many of Square’s executives and major shareholders are still held by the so-called lockup period after the offering, which prohibits them from selling their shares. Companies with relatively few shares outstanding tend to get whipsawed during volatile market periods because it becomes harder to adequately match the small amount of supply for the stock with the demand, or lack thereof. “Those tiny-float I.P.O.s come back to haunt you,” Mr. Wolff of Manhattan Venture Partners said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTech’s ‘Frightful 5’ Will Dominate Digital Life for Foreseeable Future:\\xa0There’s a little parlor game that people in Silicon Valley like to play. Let’s call it, Who’s Losing? There are currently four undisputed rulers of the consumer technology industry: Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, now a unit of a parent company called Alphabet. And there’s one more, Microsoft, whose influence once looked on the wane, but which is now rebounding. So which of these five is losing? A year ago, it was Google that looked to be in a tough spot as its ad business appeared more vulnerable to Facebook’s rise. Now, Google is looking up, and it’s Apple, hit by rising worries about a slowdown in iPhone sales, that may be headed for some pain. Over the next couple of weeks, as these companies issue earnings that show how they finished 2015, the state of play may shift once more. But don’t expect it to shift much. Asking “who’s losing?” misses a larger truth about how thoroughly Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft now lord over all that happens in tech. Who’s really losing? In the larger picture, none of them — not in comparison with the rest of the tech industry, the rest of the economy and certainly not in the influence each of them holds over our lives. \\xa0Indeed, the Frightful Five are so well protected against start-ups that in most situations, the rise of new companies only solidifies their lead. Consider that Netflix hosts its movies on Amazon’s cloud, and Google’s venture capital arm has a huge investment in Uber. Or consider all the in-app payments that Apple and Google get from their app stores, and all the marketing dollars that Google and Facebook reap from start-ups looking to get you to download their stuff. This gets to the core of the Frightful Five’s indomitability. They have each built several enormous technologies that are central to just about everything we do with computers. In tech jargon, they own many of the world’s most valuable “platforms” — the basic building blocks on which every other business, even would-be competitors, depend.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba Teams With Nvidia in $1 Billion Bet on Cloud Computing:\\xa0Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. will work with Nvidia Corp. on cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and plans to enlist about 1,000 developers to work on its big-data platform during the next three years. The arm of China’s biggest e-commerce operator, known as AliCloud, will boost investment in data analysis and machine learning, it said in a statement Wednesday. AliCloud is staking $1 billion on the belief that demand for processing and storage from governments and companies will boost growth during the next decade as its tries to compete with Amazon.com Inc. in computing services. The investment also reflects Alibaba’s own appetite for information processing as China’s online-retail market grows to 10 trillion yuan ($1.5 billion) by 2020, according to Bain & Co. The push into of cloud computing, where software and services are provided to customers via remote data centers the size of American football fields, prompted Alibaba to open its second data center in Silicon Valley in October and prepare its first in Europe. AliCloud is now extending its scope beyond basic cloud-computing services. It co-founded a quantum computing laboratory with the Chinese Academy of Sciences to help secure its data centers and develop machines capable of even faster calculations. The company will team up with Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia to provide customer support in the areas of deep-learning and high-performance computing, AliCloud said in a statement. AliCloud generates revenue mostly by charging clients a fee for using its computing infrastructure. For now, it contributes a mere sliver of total revenue, with computing and Internet infrastructure accounting for 3.1 percent of sales in the June quarter according to data compiled by Bloomberg. By comparison, Amazon Web Services’ revenue rose a better-than-expected 78 percent to $2.1 billion in the third quarter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNews Corp denies rumors of Twitter bid:\\xa0Rupert Murdoch\\'s News Corp said rumors about the company\\'s interest in buying microblogging site Twitter Inc or building a stake in it were untrue. Twitter\\'s shares, which rose as much as 14 percent on Wednesday, pared some gains and closed up 4.1 percent at $17.38. The stock rose from a record low after unconfirmed chatter about News Corp\\'s interest in Twitter circulated on Wednesday. The rumors intensified after a CNBC segment, tech website Re/code said. The social media site was evaluated as a takeover target because of the company\\'s shrinking stock price\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow Amazon Is Slowly Building a World in Which It Takes Very Little Effort to Shop\\xa0\\xa0\\'Replenishment\\' service nabs GE, other brands:\\xa0If you use all of Amazon\\'s technologies in the near future, you almost won\\'t have to leave your home. And you won\\'t even have to push buttons to get your household needs fulfilled. The Seattle-based retailer today revealed that General Electric, printer brand Brother and glucose-monitor player Gmate Smart are the latest brands to partner with Amazon Dash Replenishment. The 3-month-old program lets appliances and gadgets order products without any help at all. For instance, GE\\'s washers that utilize what\\'s called \"smart dispense technology\" can be programmed to automatically order detergent when the owner is running low on his or her go-to brand. You don\\'t even need to push one of those Amazon Dash buttons the e-commerce giant unveiled in April. Essentially, the Replenishment system will send the order through your Amazon Prime account via its namesake mobile app—think items you always need like dog food, coffee beans or grounds, ink cartridges (when it comes to Brother), blood-sugar testing strips (for Gmate Smart), water filters for purifying pitchers, dish-washing soap, etc. \\xa0No effort required, and if Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos gets his way with drones, very little human energy will be spent on delivering such items to your home. A new commercial world is emerging, indeed. Other brands that were already a part of Dash Replenishment include Whirlpool (for its high-tech dishwashers) and hand sanitizer Purell. The initiative builds on Amazon Echo, the 11-month-old speaker system with voice-control technology that lets folks order goods just by talking into the device.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy an Ex-Google Coder Makes Twice as Much Freelancing:\\xa0With a talent war raging, companies from Airbnb to Pfizer are paying top dollar for the services of independent programmers. James Knight recently made an unorthodox career move for a 27-year-old coder: quitting a well-paid gig writing software for Google to go freelance. No more catered lunches, gold-plated benefits or million-dollar views from the search giant’s Manhattan office. Knight is willing to sacrifice those perks because as an independent he’s pulling down about twice as much as he did at Google. Plus, he has more freedom. In March, Knight and his wife plan to travel to Spain and hopscotch across Europe—all the while writing code for a dating app and a self-portrait app, among others. \"I’d rather control my own destiny and take on the risk and forgo the benefits of nap pods and food,\" Knight says. Amid an accelerating war for tech talent, big companies and startups alike are paying top dollar—as much as $1,000 a hour, according to a person who gets coders gigs—for freelancers with the right combination of skills. While companies still recruit many of the best minds, they\\'re turning to independent software developers to get a stalled project moving or to gain a competitive edge. In some cases, the right person can be the difference between a failed and successful product. Last spring, Aaron Rubin hired a freelance coder through recruiter Toptal for about four weeks to help get ShipHero, his cloud-based logistics startup, off the ground. \\xa0\"To find someone that talented in New York in three days was never going to happen,\" Rubin says. \"Every talented engineer I know has a job.\\n\\n\\nNetflix global push grabs more customers than expected; shares jump 7%.\\xa0Netflix said revenue rose 22.8 percent to $1.82 billion in the December quarter.Netflix\\'s aggressive push into international markets won more customers than the video streaming service and its investors expected last quarter, sending its shares surging 7 percent. The dominant online video company said on Tuesday it had 74.8 million subscribers at the end of December and forecast 6.1 million more through March, fueled by its expansion this month into virtually every country except China, where it is exploring ways to launch its service. Shares of Netflix rose 7 percent to $115.42 in after-hours trading.New customers overseas are countering slowing growth for Netflix in the United States, the company\\'s biggest market.

Shares of the company, which receives more than half its revenue from markets outside the United States, fell 3 percent in extended trading on Tuesday. IBM has been shifting away from hardware by selling low-margin businesses such as low-end servers and semiconductors to focus on high-growth areas such as security software and data analytics, besides cloud-based services. Yet the new businesses have so far failed to make up for revenue lost to divestitures. IBM\\'s fourth-quarter revenue fell to $22.06 billion in the quarter ended Dec. Revenue from \"strategic imperatives\", which include cloud and mobile computing, data analytics, social and security software, rose about 10 percent in the fourth quarter. Net income fell to $4.46 billion, or $4.59 per share, from $5.48 billion, or $5.51 per share, a year earlier.

Shares of the company, which is in the process of selling some of its assets to cut costs, fell 7.7 percent to $1.80 in extended trading. AMD has been shifting to gaming consoles and low-power servers, but progress has lagged Wall Street expectations due to intense competition from Intel Corp and Nvidia Corp. China accounted for 42.2 percent of AMD\\'s revenue in 2014. Revenue fell 22.7 percent to $958 million but still came above analysts\\' expectation of $954.7 million. Up to Tuesday\\'s close, AMD\\'s shares had fallen 13 percent in the past 12 months. The company\\'s net loss narrowed to $102 million, or 13 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 26, from $364 million, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier.\\n\\n\\nTwitter Stock Hits New Low Amid Struggles to Keep Website Up:\\xa0Twitter Inc. shares slumped to a new all-time low after the company’s website suffered disruptions, shutting out millions of users and underscoring concerns about the company’s efforts to boost its audience and sales. Services including search and the news stream were unavailable for more than five hours after the company’s software engineers made changes to the service that lets people post and share 140-character status updates. The stock fell 7 percent to $16.69 at the close on Tuesday, well below the price of $26 at its November 2013 initial public offering. Users of Twitter’s mobile applications and website experienced a string of outages since Friday, as the company tweaks its features and services to improve the user experience and address a slowdown in growth. The glitches come at an inconvenient time for the company, which has to prove its value to any new users and keep existing ones from leaving in frustration. “The issue was related to an internal code change,” Twitter said on its website. “We reverted the change, which fixed the issue.” Services including search and the news stream were disrupted, according to the company’s performance status website. The top trending hashtag for about the past two hours was #twitterdown. Prior to the latest round of issues, Twitter’s last outage was about two months ago. Twitter’s stock has tumbled more than 28 percent in January, following a 35 percent decline in 2015.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSocial media ‘buy buttons’ are n\\'t off to a great start, but they might still be big:\\xa0In the past year, there’s been a flurry of experimentation with “buy buttons,” a way for social-media sites to allow users to purchase cocktail dresses, throw blankets, candle-making kits and sundry other items from retailers without leaving the social network. Pinterest launched “buyable pins” in June, the same month Instagram released its similar “shop now” feature. Those offerings joined ongoing tests by Facebook and Twitter for similar \\xadfunctionality. The rush by tech giants and retailers to join the buy-button arms race would suggest that these businesses see money-making potential. And given how much time people spend on social media — an estimated 1 of every 5 minutes spent on a mobile phone in the United States is on Facebook or Instagram, for example — it would be logical to assume that these buy buttons are bringing retailers a blast of online sales. But this holiday season, social channels accounted for 1.8 percent of overall online sales, according to data from Custora, whose software platform is used by many retailers. That’s just a tiny sliver of purchases, and it’s not even growing: In 2014, Custora found that social media led to 1.9 percent of sales during the same time period. But even if buy buttons have not had an explosive launch, experts say they could prove to be a crucial solution to some of retailers’ biggest online shopping problems. Right now, stores are seeing a massive “conversion gap” on mobile devices, meaning that there has been a surge in the number of people browsing sites from mobile devices, but only a small share of them are actually making purchases. In studies, shoppers frequently say they don’t buy on their smartphones because it is a hassle to enter payment information and go through a checkout process on the small screen. Buy buttons could also help retailers re-create the idea of the impulse buy for the online era. On the web, a shoppers’ journey so often begins with a search in Amazon or Google for a specific item. That has made it hard for retailers to do what they’ve long done in stores with elaborate window displays and sweet treats near the checkout counter: Persuade you to buy something eye-catching on a whim.\\n\\n\\nSon\\'s SoftBank Vision at Risk as Sprint Goes From Bad to Worse:\\xa0The acquisition of Sprint Corp. was supposed to help Masayoshi Son realize his vision of transforming SoftBank Group Corp. into the world’s most-valuable company. Instead, the 2013 deal has become his biggest setback so far, dragging down SoftBank shares and cutting into the billionaire’s wealth. SoftBank tumbled yesterday to its lowest level since the Sprint deal closed 2 1/2 years ago. Son’s fortune has shrunk by $3.2 billion over the past 12 months, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, as the Japanese company’s stock plunged. SoftBank paid $22 billion for a controlling stake in the No. 3 U.S. wireless operator at the time. That investment has lost $7.3 billion in value, according to SoftBank, and Sprint is now the No. 4 carrier. \\xa0At the same time, a slowdown in China brought down shares of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., SoftBank’s biggest holding, by 22 percent last year. “There will always be fans of SoftBank, it’s just at this moment in time, no one cares --it’s out of fashion,” said Andrew Clarke, director of trading at Mirabaud Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong. “They have too many concerns about Sprint and Alibaba because those shares are being crushed.”\\n\\n\\nUpstarts Are Leading the Fintech Movement, and Banks Take Heed:\\xa0Ryan Craine hates carrying cash and finds writing checks to be a headache. He doesn’t do much of either anymore — he mostly uses his smartphone to pay for things. Mr. Craine, a 28-year-old tech support worker in Washington, D.C., uses Apple Pay at the stores and restaurants that accept it. About 20 times a month, he turns to Venmo, a digital wallet for transferring money from one person to another, to pay his share of rent, meals, groceries and utility bills. To refinance his student loans last year, he went to an online lending start-up, Earnest. Mr. Craine’s money choices point to the millennial-led shift toward new digital financial services, a change in behavior that threatens to upend the consumer banking industry. The popularity of the services has left the major banks rushing to adapt, even as they have regained their footing after the financial crisis. Americans in their 20s and early 30s, analysts say, offer a glimpse of tomorrow’s banking market. “Their relationship with the financial system is very different — it’s an electronic one, on their smartphones,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “That can and will be very disruptive to the banking system.” Money is pouring into so-called fintech start-ups. And major technology companies — Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook and Samsung — are all entering consumer banking, typically starting with digital payment apps. Investment worldwide in start-ups focused on retail banking markets rose to nearly $6.8 billion in 2015, according to CB Insights, a research firm. That is more than triple the $2.2 billion in 2014. In 2010, 40 percent of Americans with bank accounts visited a physical branch once a week, while only 9 percent made a mobile transaction weekly, according to survey research by Javelin Strategy and Research. By 2014, the percentage reporting weekly visits to bank branches fell to 28 percent, while the weekly mobile banking share tripled, to 27 percent.\\n\\n\\nWhatsApp drops $1 subscription, studies making businesses pay:\\xa0The world\\'s most popular messaging service, WhatsApp, is dropping its token $1 fee still levied on some users as it experiments with making businesses pay to reach their customers, Chief Executive Jan Koum said on Monday. In addition, the Facebook-owned communications service expects in the coming months to offer complete encryption of messages, in a move to ensure the privacy of user conversations that is likely to draw further criticism from some governments. The authorities in the United States, Britain and elsewhere say the growing prevalence of encryption on services such as WhatsApp and Apple\\'s iMessage, hamstring their ability to monitor criminal suspects or thwart militant plots and have threatened to pass new laws to block these changes. WhatsApp, the service that offers free text, picture and video messages, has been slowly working to develop end-to-end encrypted communications services for more than a year. It has already introduced full encryption for users on Android phones. \"We are a couple of months away from calling it done,\" Koum said, noting that once completed, WhatsApp will represent the world\\'s largest service offering completely private messaging. \"Soon we will be able to talk more about this,\" he said. Once fully introduced, WhatsApp will be the largest encrypted communications service in the world, he noted.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

Startups will get tax breaks such as income-tax exemptions for the first three years, quicker patent applications, a credit guarantee program and easier routes to wind up if they fail, Modi said at a government conference for entrepreneurs in New Delhi. The fund will be established over four years. \"The government should not interfere in startups,\" Modi said on Saturday to an audience that included billionaire Masayoshi Son, the founder of Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp., and Uber Technologies Inc. Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick. \"India’s youth should be a job creator, not a seeker.\"\\n\\n\\nJawbone Raises $165 Million at Half Its Last Valuation:\\xa0Jawbone, the once-hot wearable technology start-up, said on Friday that it had raised $165 million in funding at a valuation of $1.5 billion, or roughly half the amount that the company was valued at as recently as 2014, continuing a burgeoning trend of start-ups raising money at lower values than before. When private companies raise money at a lower value than they had previously, the event is known as a “down round.” On Thursday, Foursquare announced it had raised a $45 million round of venture capital — which people familiar with the terms have said was also a down round, with Foursquare valued at $250 million, less than half of the $650 million it was valued at during its last round in 2013. Down rounds are increasing as Silicon Valley sobers up somewhat after a frothy period. In the last quarter of 2015, there was a major investment slowdown; funding to private companies dropped 30 percent from the previous quarter, to $27.3 billion, the research firm CB Insights said. Mutual fund investors have also recently marked down the valuations of other high-profile private companies like Zenefits, Dropbox and Snapchat. Down rounds, like the ones that Jawbone and Foursquare have raised, tend to destroy value for all of the pre-existing shareholders, including employees who own the company’s private stock. It has been a tumultuous year for Jawbone, which is based in San Francisco. The company’s Up fitness band line faces stiff competition in a crowded market for wearable technology that is dominated by Fitbit and Apple, according to the research firm IDC. Last year, Jawbone laid off employees as part of a restructuring. The company raised nearly $300 million in debt from the money management firm BlackRock last April.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Delivery Startups Cool, Food-Delivery Startup DoorDash Eats Its Words in Fundraising Talks:\\xa0The company lowered its ambitions by cutting as much as $400 million off its proposed valuation to investors. In meetings late last year, DoorDash pitched venture capitalists on an investment that would value the food-delivery company at $1 billion, people with knowledge of the matter said. The company is back on the fundraising trail for that same round, except this time it’s slashed its lofty goal to as low as $600 million, according to the people, who requested not to be named because the discussions were private. If DoorDash closes the financing at the terms proposed to some investors recently, the valuation would be around the same as the one from the last round in March 2015, which was $600 million, the people said this week. The talks are ongoing, and the terms could change again, they said. A spokesman for DoorDash declined to comment. The comedown for DoorDash shows delivery startups may be losing some of their allure. Such businesses are costly to operate and often take on huge losses in pursuit of growth. Instacart, the grocery-delivery company that was valued at $2 billion by investors, raised prices in December, a move it attributed partly to “changing market conditions.” It also cut staff, according to Re/code. Good Eggs, which works with farmers to deliver fresh produce, closed all of its operations outside San Francisco in August.\\n\\n\\nAlphabet (formerly known as Google) Shakes Up Its Robotics Division:\\xa0\\xa0Google’s robotics division has been plagued by low morale and a lack of leadership since the unit’s founder left abruptly in 2014. Now Alphabet is cleaning it up. Over the last two months, Alphabet, the new holding company that separated Google from its collection of speculative projects, has reframed the robots effort, moving it from a stand-alone division inside Google to a piece of the X research division. The company has also hired Hans Peter Brondmo, a technology industry veteran who last worked at Nokia, to help with management. A reorganization of the robots group is one of several recent moves inside the X division, which used to be called Google X but was rebranded with the Alphabet reorganization and recently unveiled a new logo. A range of companies, including tech competitors like Amazon and car manufacturers, are signaling their interest in robotics. X has several projects in varying degrees of completion, but has lately been “graduating” them as stand-alone companies or preparing them for such a move. The life sciences group, for example, is now called Verily. X also recently hired an auto industry veteran to lead its self-driving car effort — called Chauffeur internally — and noted that the project was a good candidate to be spun out. Robotics has gone in the opposite direction for reasons that are personal and practical. The division was created in 2013 by Andy Rubin, who led the development of the widely used Android operating system software, and it has been without a leader since Mr. Rubin left in 2014 to start a technology incubator that helps young start-ups turn their ideas into businesses. After starting the robotics division, Mr. Rubin quickly went on a buying spree, purchasing a number of promising companies, including Boston Dynamics, the maker of experimental military robots, and Schaft, an elite group of Japanese roboticists from the University of Tokyo. But while the companies were promising, Mr. Rubin invested in several technologies that had industry observers scratching their heads about his overall direction. Mr. Rubin originally said that the robotics division would be a 10-year moonshot, and when he was in negotiations to acquire companies he talked about the possibility of the driverless Google car rolling up to your house and the Google robot jumping off the back bumper. Google’s robotics effort stalled after his departure, going through a variety of leaders, including James Kuffner, a Carnegie Mellon roboticist who has since joined Toyota’s research and development laboratory in Palo Alto, and Jonathan Rosenberg, who is a troubleshooter for Larry Page, the Google co-founder who is Alphabet’s chief executive. Many in the industry say it is likely to be awhile before companies, Alphabet included, can get through the many technological and regulatory hurdles that stand in the way of robots becoming a huge business.\\n\\n\\nXiaomi Misses Smartphone Sales Target by 10% on China Slowdown:\\xa0Xiaomi Corp. sold more than 70 million smartphones last year, falling well short of its target and prompting founder Lei Jun to tell employees he was refocusing research efforts into “cool stuff” like robotics and virtual reality. The Chinese startup had a stated goal of selling 80 million devices. Xiaomi originally predicted selling 100 million units, but then changed that after China set its lowest growth target in 15 years and copycat vendors started taking away market share. The miss was a blow to company morale, Lei said in an e-mail to employees. “We set a target of 80 million and, before we knew it, it became an obligation,” Lei said. “We changed under this pressure, and everyone’s faces gradually lost all traces of humor.” The smartphone maker was one of China’s most exciting startup stories of past years, with a valuation of $45 billion that trailed only that of Uber Technologies Inc. Xiaomi thrived through online sales of budget-priced devices with advanced components, overtaking domestic competitors and challenging Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. for supremacy in the world’s biggest market. Xiaomi’s market share has been pinched by competitors including Huawei and Meizu, said Jeff Pu, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Co. They are among the Chinese vendors that have flooded the Internet with ultra-thin phones offering similar features and prices to Xiaomi’s Mi 4i and Redmi Note 2. Huawei said it shipped more than 100 million smartphones last year as it expanded in the U.S. and Europe, defying an industry slowdown. Pu expects Xiaomi’s sales growth to slow to 10 percent this year. “With sales growth slowing, Xiaomi’s valuation will be hurt,” Pu said. “It could even face a down round, as investors are less willing to pay.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntel’s Earnings Fall; Despite Exceeding Investor Expectations,\\xa0slowing data center revenue growth\\xa0sends shares down 5%:\\xa0Intel Corp\\'s (INTC.O) strong quarterly profit beat was overshadowed by concerns about slowing revenue growth in its highly profitable data center business, sending its shares down about 5.6 percent in after-market trading. In quarterly earnings reported by Intel on Thursday, the company’s revenue was up slightly from the same period last year, but money from data center chips was up markedly. Intel reported that its net income in the fourth quarter of 2015 fell 1 percent to $3.6 billion, or 74 cents a share, from the year-earlier quarter. The company said revenue climbed 1 percent, to $14.9 billion. The net income was above the expectations of Wall Street analysts. They had anticipated 63 cents a share on revenue of $14.8 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters. For all of 2015, Intel revenue was $55.4 billion, down 1 percent from 2014. Net income was $11.4 billion, down 2 percent. Intel’s share price was down about 4 percent in after-hours trading Thursday evening. Intel still gets 59 percent of its revenue from chip sales to PC makers like HP Inc. and Dell, just as Microsoft and other makers of PC software count on the demand for new PCs to sell their products. Now PCs are a tough business: On Tuesday, the market research firm IDC said 276 million PCs were shipped worldwide in 2015, a drop of 10.4 percent from 2014. On Thursday, Intel said data center chip sales, not just to clouds but to older kinds of computing, rose 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015. Along with Intel’s much smaller businesses in memory and sensor chips for devices, data center chips accounted for than 60 percent of the company’s operating profit margin. Keeping up with Moore’s Law is increasingly expensive. In 2001 research and development, along with marketing and sales, cost Intel about $8 billion. In 2015, Intel said Thursday, it cost $20.1 billion. Last year, Intel scared many technologists when it announced that a critical next step in delivering on Moore’s Law would happen about a year later than expected. The company has since released numerous charts showing this was a temporary blip. If it was more than a blip, developers of those self-driving cars, connected drones and other new devices will also struggle to make improvements. Relax, said Stacy Smith, the chief financial officer of Intel. “Moore’s Law is the heartbeat of our company,” he said. “It is the core of our competitive advantage.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon Can Now Ship Packages From China to the U.S. by Sea\\xa0- Enters the Ocean Freight Business: Amazon\\'s China subsidiary has registered in the U.S. to operate as an ocean freight forwarder, an entity that organizes the shipment of goods from a supplier or factory in one region — say, China — to a company or customer somewhere far away, like the U.S. The registration was unearthed by Flexport, a San Francisco-based logistics startup that published a blog post on the news today. “Amazon China now has the appropriate paperwork to provide ocean freight services for other companies,” the blog post read. “This is Amazon’s first step toward entering the $350 billion ocean freight market.” The move comes as Amazon continues to make inroads in controlling more of what happens after a customer clicks “Buy” to ultimately cut down on shipping costs and improve speed and reliability of deliveries. In the blog post, Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen suggests that Amazon’s competitive advantage over old-school freight forwarders will be the automation of some steps of the shipment process through software, thus cutting labor costs along the way.\\n\\n\\nYou Already Knew Parents Post on Facebook More Than Others. Now Find Out How Much:\\xa0\\xa0Its an old joke that moms and dads love to post photos of their kids on Facebook. But thanks to the social network\\'s research with Ipsos Media—they surveyed 8,000 people in eight countries—and Facebook\\'s internal data analysis, we now know just how true that idea is. Some of the more interesting findings came from its U.S.-based study. For instance, new American moms post 2.5 times more status updates, 3.5 times more photos and 4.2 times more videos than nonparents, per Facebook\\'s internal stats. And hey, the updates work: New parents\\' posts (those from moms or dads) about their babies get 37 percent more interactions from family members and 47 percent more interactions from friends than their general posts. And more than most people, new moms and dads worldwide seem to be uploading posts from their smartphones. The global end of the research—which included 1,000 people from the U.S., U.K., Canada, Mexico, Spain, Brazil, Germany and Australia, respectively—found that new parents use Facebook mobile 1.3 times more often than nonparents, Facebook found.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nParallels Between Netflix and Amazon:\\xa0Netflix has grown substantially over the last few years, now claiming more than 70 million subscribers who pay about $8 to $10 a month for access to a large library of movies and TV shows. Last year the streaming service’s stock was the best performing of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, rising 140 percent. And its prospects keep looking brighter: Last week, Reed Hastings, Netflix’s goateed chief executive, announced he would make his movies and TV shows instantly available to almost every country in the world (the big exception, for now, is China). The move nearly doubled Netflix’s potential market — the service is now accessible to more than 540 million households worldwide with broadband Internet access. On paper, Mr. Hastings’s plan to take on the traditional TV industry has long sounded slightly nutty, as delusional as Jeff Bezos’s strategy at Amazon to overrun retailing once seemed. Netflix’s plan is certainly high risk — it is spending billions to create and license content, it is fighting determined media incumbents across the globe, and it owns none of the pipes leading into people’s homes. (Among Netflix’s many competitors is Amazon itself, which has its own growing and well-regarded original-content division) A capacity for surprise is the first and most obvious similarity between Netflix and Amazon. There are lots of others. \\xa0Like Amazon, Netflix is amassing a cache of intelligence on what customers want, and it’s using that data to create content that appeals to a wide range of demographics globally. And finally, Netflix, like Amazon, is a flywheel that keeps spinning faster: As it gets more subscribers, it gets more data and more money to fund more content, which in turn helps it bring in more customers, and on and on, ever faster. Netflix barely ekes out a profit now, but the bulls say that as the flywheel spins, it will eventually begin earning enormous sums.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoPro Issues Weak Q4 Revenue Estimates, Plans to Cut 7 Percent of Workforce - Stock down 20%:\\xa0GoPro had a hard time selling cameras in the fourth quarter last year, and there are major layoffs planned at the camera maker and action sports media company. Wall Street did not take the news well. After a brief suspension in trading, the company’s stock is down more than 20 percent in after-hours trading. A release from the company says it anticipated $435 million in Q4 revenue and $1.6 billion in revenue for the 2015 calendar year, coming in way below what was expected. As a result, the company plans to cut 7 percent of its workforce. Additionally, the company’s top media exec, Zander Lurie, is leaving his job and moving onto the GoPro board. In email obtained by Re/code that CEO Nick Woodman sent to GoPro employees, Woodman places the blame for the layoffs on the “launch and pricing” of GoPro’s $399 Hero 4 Session camera last year: \"Today’s announcement reflects the issues we faced in 2015, largely related to our launch and pricing of HERO4 Session. While we clearly made a mistake pricing Session at $399 (more specifically I made the mistake, it was my decision), I’m proud of how we responded. We recognized the problem, price adjusted to $299 … recognized that wasn’t enough and price adjusted again to $199 which positioned Session as the best entry-level product we’ve ever made.\" GoPro’s stock has dropped precipitously over the last year as it has struggled to sell more cameras and develop its media business.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe big fund manager mistake of 2015? Being de-FANGed:\\xa0\\xa0Missing out on the hot technology stocks known as the \"FANG\" group last year came back to bite some well-known mutual funds. Funds that avoided Facebook, Amazon.com, Netflix and Google - now Alphabet – dramatically underperformed peers that loaded up with the fast-rising tech stocks, according to a review by Thomson Reuters’ Lipper unit. In fact, despite a volatile year in which active managers faced shifting trends in many sectors, it seems that simply choosing to overweight the FANG group was the path to beating the market. Without them, the S&P 500 Index would have declined 2.7 percent last year; instead it fell 0.7 percent, according to Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research. For the year, among 228 funds reviewed by Lipper, those that had less than 5 percent exposure to the FANG group fell 1.3 percent on average; funds with more than 10 percent exposure rose 6.4 percent. Shares in Amazon and Netflix more than doubled last year as both added more content and subscribers to their competing video-on-demand-services. Facebook rose 34 percent as the social media giant continued to increase mobile ad revenue, while Alphabet also increased revenue and showed more cost discipline, boosting its shares 47 percent. Of the four, all but Amazon have outperformed the S&P 500 so far in 2016 through Tuesday, although it is far too soon to say if the group will repeat its performance for investors in 2016.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber Invites Developers to Build Apps for Customized Passenger Distractions:\\xa0Uber, the huge ride-hailing service, delivers millions of rides to passengers. Now the company wants to give people something to do while they’re in the car. On Tuesday, Uber introduced a way for smartphone app developers to create “trip experiences” for riders. The idea, the company says, is to give riders tailored information and entertainment during their time in an Uber vehicle. Uber gave a few examples of how it might look. Upon entering the vehicle, riders could receive a quick news briefing or perhaps be served with a music playlist built to last the length of their ride. “What if developers could also offer users of their apps new ways to enjoy themselves — or get stuff done — while they’re on the road?” Chris Saad, head of product on Uber’s developer platform, wrote in a company blog post. “These integrations help make life simpler and easier for people to get around.” Uber has long been selective about how it works with partner apps and companies. It has struck deals with Facebook, Foursquare and OpenTable to allow users to hail rides from inside the companies’ apps. Uber is also working with a handful of retailers in some cities for its delivery service, UberRush. For Uber, the goal is to make the user experience more pleasant than a usual ride, which may in turn drum up repeat business and affinity for the company’s brand. The company has struck similar partnerships in the past, such as one with Spotify, in which users can select the songs being played during their Uber rides. This approach invites developers to work directly with Uber to submit and test their ideas, but Uber will have final say over whether a developer’s trip experience will be allowed. It is a different, more cautious approach than that taken by companies like Facebook and Twitter, both of which have had strained relationships with third-party developers in the past. The announcement coincided with Uber’s first hackathon in Bangalore, India, where the company is soliciting developers for new integration ideas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTech Funding Slowdown Hits Venture Capital Firms:\\xa0Venture capital firms raised less money and closed fewer U.S. funds last year, according to data from the National Venture Capital Association, a trade association. With less capital to invest, the decline from 2014 could signal an even tighter funding environment for technology startups this year. Venture capital decreased to $28.2 billion last year, from $31.1 billion in 2014, according to the report from the NVCA and Thomson Reuters. The 235 venture capital funds that closed in 2015 represent a 13 percent decline from 2014. While venture capitalists invested more money into private tech companies in 2015, the number of investments declined, according to research firm according to research firm CB Insights. This suggests that venture investors are chasing fewer but larger deals. Tiger Global closed a $2.5 billion venture fund in November. If the firm\\'s recent investments in Flipkart, Ola, and Airbnb are any indication, Tiger\\'s new fund will continue to make large bets in late-stage private companies. Some startups, facing a tougher fundraising environment, have decided to reduce spending, cut staff, and focus on turning a profit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPC shipments fall a record 10.6 percent in fourth quarter: IDC:\\xa0Global personal computer shipments fell 10.6 percent in the quarter ended in December compared to a year earlier, research firm IDC said on Tuesday, the largest decline since IDC started tracking PC shipments. Longer lifecycles for PCs, along with competition from mobile phones and tablets, have continued to hobble demand, IDC said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRocket Internet faces new setback with loss of senior managers:\\xa0Germany\\'s Rocket Internet is losing two senior managers, sources told Reuters, in the latest setback for a company that a year ago was considered one of Europe\\'s best hopes for competing with global tech giants. Europe\\'s largest internet firm, which has helped create a buzzing tech scene in Berlin, seeks to be a launch pad for stock market listings of start-ups ranging from online fashion to food delivery, but has seen its stock slide as plans to float its bigger investments have stalled. Rocket\\'s strategy of rapidly expanding into scores of emerging markets raised the possibility that it could outflank the likes of Amazon and Alibaba as well as powerful venture capital firms. But planned flotations of Rocket start-ups have been put on ice in the past year due to a cooling market for tech initial public offerings (IPO) with investors increasingly unwilling to meet high valuations. Now it faces further upheaval with Franziska Leonhardt, head of its legal department, and Uwe Gleitz, senior vice president of corporate finance, both departing soon, according to sources close to the company, both for personal reasons. Leonhardt and Gleitz were members of the team that steered Rocket through its own IPO in October 2014, since which its share price has fallen by almost half from the 42.50 offer price. Since it started out in 2007, Rocket has set up dozens of e-commerce firms around the world, but all of its current crop are still loss-making - meaning it needs to keep eating into its cash reserves to keep them afloat, and making corporate finance a crucial department.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFlipkart, Amazon’s India Rival, Changes CEOs:\\xa0In a move that has been rumored for some time, Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal has stepped down as CEO of the Indian e-commerce company, the company announced today. He will be replaced by his co-founder, Binny Bansal (no relation). Sachin Bansal will become executive chairman and “mentor the senior leadership of the company and look for new investment opportunities,” the company said in the announcement. Binny Bansal, formerly chief operating officer, will now run the business day to day. The move comes as competition for market share in India’s burgeoning online shopping industry has ramped up between Amazon, Flipkart and fellow Indian upstart Snapdeal. Amazon has promised to invest billions into its India business, which is run by Amit Agarwal, who spent two years earlier in his career working as Jeff Bezos’s right-hand man.\\n\\n\\nUber China Raises Financing at $7 Billion Valuation:\\xa0Uber said its China division has raised financing that values that part of the ride-hailing company\\'s operation at $7 billion. Travis Kalanick, Uber\\'s chief executive officer, discussed the new funds at a press conference in Beijing on Monday. Uber is bumping up against local competitors around the world. Nowhere is the competition more fierce than in China, where Uber faces Didi Kuaidi. The company is backed by Alibaba and Tencent, the country’s two most valuable technology companies. Uber and Didi Kuaidi are each spending aggressively to expand, partly by subsidizing the costs of rides. In a letter to investors in 2015, Kalanick committed to spending $1 billion that year in China. It may have surpassed that figure. Didi Kuaidi said on Monday that it completed 1.43 billion trips in 2015. Uber said it increased its share of the private car market in China to 30 percent or 35 percent as of the end of 2015, from 1 percent in January 2015. (The Information reported a similar figure earlier on Monday.) Didi Kuaidi said it holds 87.2 percent of China\\'s private car-hailing market, attributing the figure to a Chinese research firm. A recent round of financing gave Didi Kuaidi a valuation of $16.5 billion, a person familiar with the matter said in September. Uber, which owns a controlling stake in Uber China, was last valued at $62.5 billion, people familiar with the matter said in December. Uber China’s $7 billion valuation does not include the new cash.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDigital Display Ads to Overtake Search, Bringing a Reckoning for Google:\\xa0As advertising keeps flooding over from television to digital screens, this year will mark a first: More online ad dollars will go to ads that aren’t for search results than to those that are. That’s per eMarketer, which measures this sort of stuff. A Monday report claims that spending on display ads — banners, videos, sponsored content and in-stream mobile promotions — will outpace search ads in 2016. The research firm estimates that U.S. spending on display will hit $32.2 billion this year (a 47 percent annual growth), overtaking spending on search (estimated at $29.2 billion, a 10 percent growth). That trend does not bode well for Google, which reaps the lion’s share of search ad revenue. Of course, the search giant also reaps other ad money — from its massive banner business and YouTube, primarily. But in this category of digital ads, Facebook is a far greater foe. Figures from eMarketer show that Facebook claimed just under 30 percent of U.S. display ads in 2015, more than twice Google’s share. Plus, many in the industry see Facebook’s nascent automated ad platforms as a potential threat to Google. Google knows this — that the tremendous profitability of its search business will peter out eventually. Hence the importance of Alphabet: It is scouring for some business after search.\\n\\n\\nIsrael brings tech expertise to protecting connected cars:\\xa0Most cars today are equipped with some level of connectivity and self-driving vehicles are being developed. Given this level of sophistication, protecting cars from contamination with malicious software has become big business. Building on its expertise in technology, Israel is emerging as a leader in the race to keep cars secure and prevent the nightmare scenario of a hacker commandeering your vehicle. The threat appears real enough. Fiat Chrysler recalled 1.4 million vehicles to install new software last year after cybersecurity researchers showed they could turn off a Jeep Cherokee\\'s engine as it drove. Software manipulation, albeit intentional, was also behind Volkswagen\\'s emissions scandal. From its headquarters in Tel Aviv, Check Point, one of the world\\'s largest cyber security firms, pioneered the computer firewall two decades ago. It hopes to repeat that success with a security capsule for vehicles. Connected cars need a two-pronged defense. First, they must make sure nothing bad gets in, like a virus sneaking through a navigation system. Then they have to keep internal communications secure to allow functions like side-view mirrors which angle down when vehicles are put into reverse.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZuckerberg Plea for Free Web in India Wins Support in Review:\\xa0A majority of Indians who submitted comments to the nation’s telecommunications regulator said they support Facebook Inc.’s Free Basics plan that would allow free Web access. Telecom Regulatory Authority of India said that 1.35 million responses in support of the plan -- or 56 percent of all comments -- came from Facebook’s @supportfreebasics.in, according to a report on the agency’s review of different pricing for data services. It received another 544,000 responses from @facebookmail.com, with most backing Facebook’s plan, the regulator said, without providing a percentage. Comments either supporting or opposing differential pricing were “basically template responses\" and \"identical in nature,\" the regulator said Saturday on its website, without explaining how the views would be used in the review. The agency’s chief, R.S. Sharma, told The Hindu newspaper in an interview published Jan. 1 that such responses were \"not helpful at all\" and didn’t represent meaningful input. The regulator has appealed to respondents and Facebook to solicit more detailed opinions. Facebook Chairman Mark Zuckerberg made a personal appeal in one of India’s leading newspapers last month for the country to allow a free Internet service. Facebook’s proposed Free Basics plan allows customers to access the social network and other services such as education, health care and employment listings from their phones without a data plan. Industry groups say the program threatens the principles of net neutrality and could change pricing in India for access to different websites.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAerodrome Is The First Commercial Airport For Drones:\\xa0Aerodrome is working with the City of Boulder, Nevada, to launch the first commercial drone airport — the Eldorado Droneport. It’s one of only a handful of FAA-appointed UAS test sites in the United States. The plan is to offer training, maintenance and other support functions for the commercial drone industry, as well as for individual drone pilots. The company already operates teaching facilities in Detroit, Michigan and Henderson, Nevada.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIsrael’s Best-Performing Tech Stock Hasn’t Sold a Single Product:\\xa0Occupying a small, second-floor space in the same office park as 3D printing giant Stratasys, a tiny Israeli upstart is trying to sell investors on a future in which physical objects materialize with the press of a button. Nano Dimension is nowhere near achieving that goal, yet somehow has become Israel’s best-performing technology stock in 2015. While Stratasys lost nearly three-quarters of its value last year, the much smaller Nano Dimension rallied 261 percent. Not bad for a company with no customers or revenue. This little 3D printing shop, with 44 employees and a market cap of 193 million shekels ($49 million), has become a source of hope for Israeli entrepreneurs struggling to secure venture capital. That’s because Nano Dimension took an unorthodox route to raise about $18 million and become a public company, while managing to avoid the long, costly process of an initial public offering. \\xa0Nano Dimension found its way onto the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange using what’s known as a reverse merger. This involves a private company taking over a public one, bypassing the formalities of an IPO. “We’re selling shares like any other public company,” said Amit Dror, the chief executive officer of Nano Dimension. “It’s just that it happens to be that our case is a public company that’s pre-revenue.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChina Setting Up Fund for Its Electronics Industry:\\xa0\\xa0A Chinese technology regulator said on Friday that it would cooperate with a bank to set up a $30 billion fund to support the country’s huge electronics supply chain. The creation of the new fund underscores China’s ambitions to expand its tech capabilities and also signals how those ambitions are being threatened by slowing growth and recent market turmoil. Official accounts of the fund did not make clear precisely how the money would be spent. But given the recent weakness in Chinese manufacturing and lower-end electronics manufacturers, it may be intended as a form of stimulus to the tech industry. The terminology used in media accounts signals China’s bold technology ambitions. Reports about the new fund said it would be used to build a “strong manufacturing country” and an “Internet power.” A report in state-run media said the fund was created to address problems faced by small and medium enterprises that have come under pressure or folded recently because of a lack of funding. The report made reference to recent factory closures, specifically pointing out the closing in October of Fu Chang Electronic Technology, a supplier to the telecom equipment makers Huawei and ZTE. The fund will be created through a partnership between an industry group controlled by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and Ping An Bank. Signaling the importance of the initiative, the signing ceremony was held at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, which is often used to host visiting dignitaries, and was attended by representatives of many of China’s largest technology companies, including Lenovo and Alibaba, according to an official release. The new fund seems to resemble a separate multibillion-dollar fund, announced in 2014, to provide financing and enable acquisitions to increase the size and sophistication of the country’s semiconductor industry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFlashing Red: A day of distress in the financial markets, and of distress sales in the tech startup-world.\\n\\n\\nU.S., world stock markets slide as panic in China spreads:\\xa0A collapse in China’s ailing stock market spread like contagion across the globe again Thursday, pummeling nervous investors looking for respite from the week’s rocky trading. Chinese stocks traded for less than 30 minutes, slumping 7 percent and triggering the second emergency market closure this week. The action prompted markets in Europe to retreat and then spread to the United States, where stocks tumbled 2 percent. China’s CSI 300 had traded for only 14 minutes before the first circuit breaker kicked in, calling a 15-minute halt to trading after a 5 percent fall. But instead of calming the market, it caused only more panic. When trading reopened, prices soon fell further, triggering a halt for the rest of the day. The Dow Jones industrial average, which tracks 30 blue-chip stocks, and the Standard & Poor’s 500, a broader measure of the market, both fell about 2.3 percent. They have lost about 5 percent of their value the week so far. The tech-heavy Nasdaq suffered the deepest losses, falling 3 percent on Thursday. It is down about 6 percent this week and on pace to enter a what’s known as a correction, meaning the index will have fallen about 10 percent from its most recent high. The sell-off was widespread, even hitting tech giants Apple and Amazon, which were down 4 percent and 3.7 percent respectively. JPMorgan Chase slid 4 percent, while Nordstrom tumbled 5.5 percent. \\xa0\\n\\n\\nDistress Sale #1:\\xa0Gilt’s Unicorn Tale Comes To An End After Being Acquired For $250M:\\xa0Hudson’s Bay Company, the owner of department chain stores like Saks Fifth Avenue, said today it was acquiring Gilt Groupe for $250 million. The sale still represents a tough end to the story of Gilt. The startup was one of the original darling flash-sale sites coming out of New York. But that whole market has found itself challenged by slim operating margins, its initial popularity waning, and the difficulties of building a large-scale e-commerce operation. Prior to the acquisition, the company had been widely considered to be part of the billion-dollar startup club. But the company struggled to become profitable, and in October last year the company continued cutting jobs (at that time laying off 45 people). The company previously said a few times that it would go public in 2013 and 2014, before putting that on hold indefinitely and raising additional capital. It’s also not the greatest return for its investors. Prior to the sale the company had raised more than $270 million, which makes this look like a deal that will not return the total amount of money that it had raised.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDistress Sale #2:\\xa0One Kings Lane, Once Valued at $900 Million, Is Likely to Sell for a Fraction of That:\\xa0One Kings Lane, the online seller of furniture and home decor that has struggled for the better part of the last two years, has been running a process to sell the company for several months, four sources told Re/code. The company had aimed to seal a deal by the end of 2015, one of these people said, calling it a “fire sale.” After originally seeking a higher price, One Kings Lane notified potential buyers in the last few months that it was willing to sell for less than the $230 million it had raised in venture capital, multiple sources said. It’s not clear if a deal is done or who the potential buyer would be, but sources say a deal is unlikely to fetch more than $150 million. That would mean at least some investors will lose money and any employee stock would likely become worthless. Several of One Kings Lane’s investors have a liquidation preference, according to venture data startup PitchBook, meaning they will get paid out before holders of common stock, such as employees. The company most recently cut a quarter of its staff in December, including five members of its senior management team. Sources said the layoffs were likely a condition to get a deal done.\\n\\n\\nDistress Sale #3:\\xa0Quikr closes purchase of online real estate portal Commonfloor.com, pushed by investor Tiger Global:\\xa0Online classifieds firm Quikr India Pvt. Ltd, one of India’s most valuable start-ups, bought real estate portal CommonFloor in a distress sale orchestrated by Tiger Global Management Llc, the influential US-based hedge fund that is an investor in both. Quikr, valued at an estimated $1 billion, and CommonFloor (maxHeap Technologies Pvt. Ltd) didn’t disclose the terms of the transaction, but two people familiar with the matter said Quickr paid $120 million in an all-stock deal. The people spoke on condition of anonymity. CommonFloor was valued at more than $150 million when it last raised Rs.60 crore from Google Capital in December 2014. The company raised a total of Rs.321 crore from Tiger, Accel Partners and Google Capital since 2011. Quikr and CommonFloor have valuations that seem disproportionate to their revenue. Quikr reported sales of Rs.24.78 crore for the year ended 31 March 2015 while CommonFloor generated sales of Rs.45.76 crore for that year, according to documents with the Registrar of Companies. Despite having generated revenue that is much larger than Quikr’s, CommonFloor attracted a much lower valuation because of the valuation metrics used by e-commerce investors that may seem peculiar to shareholders in traditional businesses.\\n\\n\\nSamsung\\'s Earnings Miss Underlines Sputtering Global Demand:\\xa0Samsung Electronics’s profit miss is the latest sign the global smartphone market is running out of steam, spelling trouble for the suppliers of displays, semiconductors and other components that go into mobile devices. The world’s largest maker of displays and memory chips, which sells to Apple and many other brands, posted fourth-quarter profit that fell short of analysts’ estimates as sales remained sluggish over the holiday season. Demand is waning for smartphones as markets mature and China’s economy slows, pressuring profit margins at Samsung. Concerns that the smartphone market is fizzling out has spurred analysts to trim estimated demand, which in turn has hammered device vendors as well as suppliers of components and contract assemblers. Apple, which garners most of the industry’s profits, ended Thursday below $100 for the first time in over a year after investment brokerages from UBS \\xa0to Morgan Stanley lowered forecasts on iPhone shipments. Samsung phone shipments are headed for their second straight annual decline in the wake of tougher competition from Apple in the high-end segment to China’s Xiaomi \\xa0and Huawei. for budget consumers. Yet even Xiaomi, which rose from obscurity to become the country’s biggest phone brand, may have missed its 80-million unit sales target in 2015, people with knowledge of its production plans have said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon Is Now Selling Its Own ARM-Based Chips:\\xa0An Israeli company acquired by Amazon last year has announced a new line of semiconductors, marking Amazon’s first foray into the chipmaking market. The company, Annapurna Labs, announced its Alpine line of ARM-based processors on Wednesday, nearly a year after Amazon acquired it for a reported $350 million. The company says that its chips are designed for Wi-Fi routers, media streaming devices, connected home products and data storage gear, and that they’ve already been used in commercial products from Asus, Netgear, and Synology.\\n\\n\\nCollapse in Q4 Venture Deal-Making Could Signal End of Unicorn Era: A study released in October found that venture capital firms were raising significantly less money than in previous quarters. Around that time, a bunch of well-known investors — like Union Square Ventures’ Fred Wilson — began saying that the days of steady unicorn valuations were coming to a close. Here’s more cold water: An upcoming report from CB Insights says that VC funding levels in the fourth quarter of 2015 “fell 30 percent amid weakening mega-round activity while deal activity fell 13 percent vs. the previous quarter.” Here are the core findings from the KPMG International & CB Insights 2015 Venture Pulse Report, which will be released on January 19: In the third quarter of 2015, there were 72 $100 million equity funding rounds for VC-backed companies. In Q4, there were only 39 of those gigantic growth equity rounds. There were only nine new unicorns birthed in the fourth quarter, versus 23 in Q3. Deal-making activity in general fell to its lowest levels since the first quarter of 2013. While these numbers are by far the most concrete indicator that venture startup investing is getting less, um, frothy, there have been warning signs for the last few months. December data from Ernst & Young indicated that tech startups were avoiding IPOs, partly fearful that public markets would tank their private sector valuations. In November, a series of valuation writedowns of a number of unicorn startups shaved billions off Snapchat, Zenefits and other high-flying and fast-growing tech companies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",
      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook’s Oculus Says It Will Charge $599 for the Rift:\\xa0After months of teasing the introduction of its Oculus Rift virtual reality goggles, the company said on Wednesday that it had opened orders for the system, which includes a headset and controller devices, with a price of $599. That’s without a computer included — you’ll need a fast one that will probably cost around $1,000. The device begins shipping in March. Oculus also said that in February, it would open orders for a bundle, which includes the Rift headgear system and a computer that is certified to work with Oculus, for $1,500. Oculus is just one of many companies preparing to offer virtual reality devices this year. HTC, the Taiwanese manufacturer, worked with the software distribution company Valve to develop the virtual reality gadget Vive that will be released in April. Similar to Oculus, the Vive requires connecting to a powerful computer, meaning the pricing should be similarly high. The companies have not announced the price yet. And Samsung Electronics teamed with Oculus last year to offer an entry-level virtual reality system, the Gear VR. That device, at $100, requires inserting a Samsung Galaxy smartphone into the headgear because it relies on the smartphone’s screen for video and its computing brains for running apps and games.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple’s App Store made $1.1 billion over the holidays:\\xa0Apple said Wednesday that customers bought $1.1 billion worth of apps and in-app purchases in the two weeks between Dec. 20 and Jan. 3 alone. They also set a new single-day spending record, dropping $144 million on apps on New Year\\'s Day. In a release, Apple said that this broke a record that had been set just a week before, on Christmas Day. Overall, Apple said that customers spent $20 billion on App Store purchases in 2015. Most popular apps included games such as Minecraft: Pocket Edition, Trivia Crack and Heads Up!, as well as messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger, WeChat and Snapchat. In terms of top-grossers, Apple also noted that gaming and subscription apps did the best this year, mentioning Clash of Clans, Monster Strike, Game of War - Fire Age and Fantasy Westward Journey as well as Netflix, Hulu and Match. The firm was also quick to note that the App Store has made developers about $40 billion over the lifetime of the App Store, with roughly one-third of that figure -- about $13 billion -- coming from 2015 alone. Last year, the company said that it had generated $10 billion in revenue for developers in 2014.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNetflix Goes Live in 130 New Countries Including India - But China Skipped; Shares Advance:\\xa0Netflix Inc. began selling its streaming service in India and more than 100 other countries, closing in on its goal of becoming the first global online television service. The stock logged its biggest gain since July, surging 9.3 percent. Netflix went live in 130 new countries, including Russia, Poland and Singapore, during his presentation. Adding India, most of the rest of Asia and other countries around the world marks a major step for Netflix. But China, the world’s most populous country, remains a gap. The company faces challenges in China, where a local partnership is essential given government controls over licensing for online content, and many potential allies already have competing businesses. Alibaba recently acquired full control of Youku Tudou, one of the largest video streaming services in the country, while Baidu and Tencent own popular video services.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNetflix launches in India; basic monthly subscription at Rs 500:\\xa0\\xa0Netflix is offering three packages for Indian consumers starting with a basic plan that would cost Rs 500 a month and allow users to access all content on any one device at a time with standard definition quality. The other two higher subscription plans allows users to watch content with HD or ultra HD quality and a choice of 2-4 devices at the same time. The topmost package is priced at Rs 800 a month. In contrast, domestic and international peers in India like Hungama Play, BoxTV of Times Group, HOOQ and Singapore-based Spuul charge Rs 200-300 a month. HOOQ, which was launched globally in a three-party JV by Sony Pictures, SingTel and Warner Brothers a year ago, also offers a bundled deal with Airtel’s Wynk Movies App. A cable TV service, on the other hand, costs around Rs 250-300 a month for a bouquet of a basic set of channels in the country. Where Netflix can differentiate is its huge catalogue, especially English language entertainment content. It is currently offering a one month free look period. However, this comes with a catch. Besides bandwidth issue and cost of watching entertainment content online another hurdle to wider adoption of Netflix to begin with could be its insistence on credit card details even if one chooses to opt for a one month tasting period.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple falls on Nikkei report of ~30% iPhone production cuts:\\xa0Apple is expected to cut production of its latest iPhone models by about 30 percent in the January-March quarter, the Nikkei reported. As inventories of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus have piled up since they were launched last September, production will be scaled back to let dealers go through their current stock, the business daily reported. Apple\\'s shares were down 2.2 percent at $102.97 in afternoon trading. The stock has lost about a quarter of its value from record highs in April, reflecting worries over slowing shipments. \"This is an eye-opening production cut which speaks to the softer demand that Apple has seen with 6s out of the gates,\" FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said. \"The Street was bracing for a cut but the magnitude here is a bit more worrisome.\" Apple shares fell on the report. Tepid forecast by Apple suppliers such as Jabil Circuit, which manufactures casings for iPhones, and Dialog Semiconductor GmbH in December stoked fears that iPhone shipments could fall for the first time. Wall Street has also tempered its view on the high-flying stock in recent months. Since early December, about a third of the analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters have trimmed their estimates on Apple.\\n\\n\\nStuff from CES that you may actually want to buy:\\xa0CES, the largest consumer electronics show in the world, kicked off Monday with a sneak peek at what some companies will be exhibiting on the show floor this week. Even with a smaller sampling of exhibitors, there was a dizzying amount of tech to take in -- everything from drones to laser-powered gizmos that promise to regrow your hair. We walked the floor and picked out five items that might be worth buying if they ever get to the market. There is a catch: Like so much of the gadgetry on display at CES, all of these items aren\\'t for sale yet. They also don\\'t have some of the finer details, such as price, worked out yet either.\\xa0Parrot drones\\xa0have been a highlight of CES for many years, and this year is no different. The company is showing off a new model called the Parrot Disco, a fixed-wing drone that you can launch by hurling it into the air like a Frisbee.\\xa0Ili, the wearable translator:\\xa0This little translator is about the size of a thumb drive, has one button and is described as the world\\'s first wearable translator. The idea is that users speak into the device while holding down the button, let go, and then have the Ili translate into another language in real time. The whole thing is designed to work offline -- so no connection needed. It instead draws on a database of words and phrases stored locally in the device.\\xa0Stabilo Digipen:\\xa0Moving from the high-flying to the everyday, Stabilo\\'s Digipen promises to be the modern notetaking instrument of my dreams. Made by an established German pen company, this souped-up ballpoint reads and learns the way you write and converts it into digital text for you. Unlike other smart pens, the Digipen is designed to work with any kind of paper.\\n\\n\\nIndia’s most funded hyperlocal startup Grofers shuts shop in 9 cities:\\xa0Hyperlocal grocery and fresh food delivery startup Grofers India Pvt Ltd, which ran a massive expansion drive four months ago, has shut down its operations in nine cities. The cities where it has stopped services are Bhubaneswar, Ludhiana, Bhopal, Kochi, Mysore, Nashik, Rajkot, Coimbatore and Visakhapatnam. Grofers reportedly withdrew from the nine cities as it didn’t see much uptake even after running massive marketing campaigns. A company spokesperson told Mint that all the employees in these cities are being relocated to other centres. The company’s founder Albinder Dhindsa did not respond to Techcircle.in calls to confirm the development.\\n\\n\\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey\\xa0Shows\\xa0Users Why 10,000-Character Tweets Aren’t So Crazy:\\xa0Show, don’t tell. It’s a general rule for writers and it was a helpful tool for Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey Tuesday afternoon just a few hours after Re/code reported that the company is working on a feature that would allow people to send tweets that are 10,000 characters long. (The current limit is 140 characters.) As expected, Twitter users freaked out, so Dorsey tweeted an explanation for the potential change, and he did so in many, many characters. Because Twitter can’t accommodate more than 140 characters in a single tweet, Dorsey shared his much-too-long explanation as a photo instead. This is the closest Twitter has ever come to speaking publicly about the feature, referred to internally as “Beyond 140.” The product could launch as early as March, according to sources, but Dorsey didn’t acknowledge a launch date in his post. It’s clear, though, that Twitter isn’t afraid to make drastic changes to the product in its effort to jump-start user growth and its sagging stock price.\\n\\n\\nIn reversal of strategy, \\xa0Verizon launches auction to sell data centers - sources:\\xa0Verizon has started a process to sell its data center assets, hoping to fetch more than $2.5 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, as the U.S. telecommunications conglomerate focuses on its core business. A sale would represent the latest effort by Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, to streamline its portfolio following a divestment last year of a chunk of its landline business and a portfolio of wireless towers. It would also mark a reversal of its strategy to expand in hosting and colocation services after it acquired data center operator Terremark Worldwide Inc in 2011 for $1.4 billion. The so-called \\'colocation\\' portfolio up for sale includes 48 data centers, and generates annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of around $275 million, one of the people said.\\n\\n\\nFitbit Takes On the Apple Watch With the Blaze - Stock Falls 18% on News: The fitness tracking leader goes for a full-on, fashionable smartwatch. Fitbit has come out swinging by introducing the Blaze, the company\\'s first smartwatch with some fashion sense. \\xa0The Blaze isn\\'t a smartwatch that you can weight down with apps or customize to organize your entire digital life. It is primarily meant to be a detailed fitness tracker that can be worn all the time, offering a few additional features for convenience. Apart from interacting with Fitbit\\'s own fitness app, the Blaze can push calendar appointments, calls, and texts, but it doesn\\'t get into the weeds with such things as e-mail or Twitter notifications. The Fitbit Blaze will set you back $200 for the tracker and the rubber strap that\\'s included. Additional rubber straps will cost $30, leather options are $100, and the steel bracelet is the most expensive, at $130. The Fitbit Blaze is now available for pre-order via Fitbit and will go on sale January 6 via Fitbit\\'s larger retailers such at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target in the United States. Global availability isn\\'t yet set, but the Blaze will start rolling out outside the U.S. in March. \\xa0After the announcement, shares fell throughout the day before ending down 18 percent. The Fitbit Blaze, starting at around $200, represents not only new competition with smartwatch makers, but also potentially a lack of focus for the company — which investors may be punishing. Fitbit had carved out a strong niche in the fitness tracking market, setting itself up for one of the strongest stock performances from companies that went public last year.\\n\\n\\nExpanding push into ad-tech,\\xa0Oracle Buys Audience Tracking Firm AddThis For Around $200M:\\xa0Oracle continues to ramp up its business in the area of marketing tech. Today the enterprise software giant announced that it has acquired AddThis, which makes sharing features (i.e., those buttons on web pages that let you share stories or follow accounts on Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and audience tracking technology for online publishers and marketers. AddThis says it currently covers activity data for 1.9 billion monthly unique visitors and over 15 million mobile and desktop web domains. Oracle and AddThis are not disclosing the terms of the deal, but we have been digging around, and sources with knowledge of the company tell us that it was in the region of $100 million to $200 million, closer to the latter. The acquisition underscores a couple of bigger developments in the world of advertising and marketing tech. The first of these is the growing role that Oracle is playing in this area. Oracle says that it will continue to serve existing clients of AddThis, but it is currently evaluating the future product roadmap. More concretely, AddThis will become a part of Oracle’s Data Cloud business, a division that also includes assets from two other recent Oracle acquisitions: BlueKai (advertising data) and Datalogix (marketing data). Taken together, the technology and big data portfolios that Oracle has amassed in this division give the company a strong play for more business from brands and ad firms, as well as from online content companies that want better tools to make better sense of their audiences and to monetise them more effectively. Secondly, the deal points to a wider trend for consolidation in marketing tech and ad tech. While AddThis has been around for more than a decade, it’s interesting to see that it finally made the leap to join a bigger company. On its own, AddThis had developed some interesting, but also somewhat controversial, technology. One example, “canvas fingerprinting,” was being tested by AddThis last year as a potential replacement for cookies, by way of a digital image created by each browser to follow users wherever they went online. As Pro Publica described it, canvas fingerprinting was “extremely persistent” and nearly impossible to block, raising concerns from privacy advocates. It’s not clear whether canvas fingerprinting is something that AddThis uses today, or whether Oracle plans to market the tech in future. AddThis is Oracle’s 96th acquisition.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAugmented Reality Versus Virtual Reality: Understand the Difference:\\xa0The Battle Is Real: Although virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have existed in some form for decades, only recently have they garnered mainstream attention. VR is blowing up right now, and its content and hardware advances have been exciting to watch. In a short amount of time, content creators have made some mind-blowing advances in storytelling with this new technology. Brands, movie studios, gaming companies and news organizations are all tinkering with this tool and channel. VR will gain ascendancy throughout 2016, but my money’s on AR becoming the dominant technology in our daily lives. The New York Times recently distributed more than one million Google cardboards to its digital-edition subscribers. YouTube and Facebook are enabling VR online through digital video players. Everything is aligning to have VR hit critical mass next year. VR is the only medium that guarantees the user’s complete focus on the content. There is no looking away, no checking email or text messages and no updating social-media statuses. VR is the most immersive way to tell a story because what happens inside that headset makes you feel something in your head, heart and gut. But VR’s biggest strength is also its greatest weakness. The immersive nature of VR hinders users from interacting with their surroundings. It takes them out of the moment. They can’t walk around and see what is right next to them, look people in the eye or read someone’s body language. VR is a powerful way to experience content, but is not practical for interacting in the real world. And therein lies the major problem with VR. Content is king, no doubt, and providing immersive experiences is the holy grail in advertising. But VR will never become an innocuous part of our daily lives. AR adds contextual layers of information to our experiences in real time. We have seen this future foretold in Hollywood films, such as Avatar, Minority Report, Iron Man and Wall-E, among others. Soon these depictions will become real. However, AR has issues with execution, which tends to feel gimmicky. Remember pointing your smartphone to a print ad to get some poorly made content? Google Glass showed some innovative AR applications, but they were ultimately a failure because the hardware and technology were too broad and lacked focus on the consumer problem they were trying to solve. These examples have shown the promise of AR, but have failed to deliver on contextual utility. Still, the future is bright for AR with several tech companies working on their AR offerings. Microsoft is working on HoloLens AR headset glasses. Developer kits are scheduled to hit the market in early 2016. Google invested in a company called Magic Leap, whose technology beams lasers into the viewer’s iris to activate AR. That future will become a reality in another year’s time. Both VR and AR tinker with our reality — but AR enhances it, while VR diverts us from it, which is why the latter will come to the fore in 2017, with its promise of contextual data for marketers and utility for consumers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOculus to take preorders for Virtual Reality headset Rift from Wednesday:\\xa0\\xa0Oculus, the virtual reality company owned by Facebook Inc, said on Monday it would take preorders for its much-awaited virtual reality headset, Rift, from Wednesday. The Rift would come bundled with the game, Lucky\\'s Tale, and a multiplayer space combat game, EVE: Valkyrie, Oculus said in a blog post. The blog post did not contain any further information such as pricing of the headset. Rift \"remains on schedule to ship in Q1,\" Oculus had said in a blog post last week. However, the touch controller, a pair of motion controllers, would be delayed and shipped only in the second half of 2016, the company had said. In September, Oculus and Samsung unveiled a new version of Gear VR virtual reality headset for $99.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nG.M., Expecting Rapid Change, Invests $500 Million in Lyft:\\xa0The founders of Lyft, the ride-hailing service, have long imagined that the future of transportation would involve fewer cars on the road. Now General Motors is helping the start-up reach that goal. Lyft announced on Monday that G.M. had invested $500 million in the company, or half of its latest $1 billion venture financing round. The funding, which recently closed, values Lyft at $4.5 billion, not including the new capital. G.M.’s $500 million interest in Lyft is the single largest direct investment by an auto manufacturer into a ride-hailing company in the United States, according to data from PitchBook, an alliance that pairs an auto stalwart with the kind of start-up trying to disrupt it. The investment reflects how much consumer automotive habits have been changed by technology over the last decade. With the rise of ride-sharing companies, car manufacturers have raced to adapt to how people can now use each other’s vehicles for rides, which could potentially lead to a decline in car ownership.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nToyota Snubs Tech Companies With Ford Dashboard Deal:\\xa0Toyota Motor Corp. agreed to use a car-phone connectivity system championed by Ford Motor Co. in a front to keep Apple Inc. and Google from dominating control of dashboards. Toyota will introduce a telematics system with Ford’s SmartDeviceLink, an open platform that the automakers are inviting their peers to adopt for in-car applications, it said in a statement. Toyota has resisted offering Apple’s CarPlay and Google’s Android Auto, citing safety and security concerns, while Ford is offering them as apps within its Sync connectivity system this year. The deal shows two of the world’s largest automakers remain wary about giving Apple and Google too much control over displays that IHS Automotive estimates will generate $18.6 billion in sales by 2021. For Toyota, which is involved in another system called MirrorLink that competes with the two tech giants, the collaboration with Ford suggest the company is spreading its bets on car connectivity options. Ahead of this week’s Consumer Electronics Show, Toyota also said it will equip U.S. vehicles with data communication modules next year that connect cars with cellular networks. The modules will enable a system that notifies authorities when air bags deploy due to traffic accidents.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba\\'s Finance Arm Said to Seek at Least $1.5 Billion:\\xa0Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s finance affiliate is seeking at least 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) in a second round of fundraising ahead of a planned initial public offering, a person familiar with the matter said. Zhejiang Ant Small & Micro Financial Services Group Co., controlled by Alibaba’s billionaire chairman Jack Ma, plans to issue stock to existing and new investors, according to the person, who asked not to be identified as the details are private. The firm, known as Ant Financial, is speaking to potential investors including insurers and other financial institutions, as well as private equity funds and venture capital firms, the person said. Challenging bricks-and-mortar banks, the Internet-based Ant Financial runs China’s biggest online payment service, Alipay, and controls the company which manages Yu’E Bao, the nation’s largest money-market fund with more than 600 billion yuan of assets. It also holds a stake in MYBank, a private online lender. Ant Financial was valued at about $45 billion after completing an initial round of fundraising in June 2015, the person said. The company may sell shares in an IPO as early as this year and hasn’t decided yet whether to conduct a third round of financing ahead of that, according to the person. Ant Financial may use money from the current fundraising for acquisitions, the person said, without identifying potential targets. Ant Financial has already invested in companies including India’s One97 Communications Ltd. and Postal Savings Bank of China.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook fights for Free Basics in India, global test-case:\\xa0India has become a battleground over the right to unrestricted Internet access, with local tech start-ups joining the front line against Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his plan to roll out free Internet to the country\\'s masses. The Indian government has ordered Facebook\\'s Free Basics plan to be put on hold while it decides what to do. The program, launched in around three dozen developing countries, offers pared-down web services on mobile phones, along with access to Facebook\\'s own social network and messaging services, without charge. But critics say the program, launched 10 months ago in India in collaboration with operator Reliance Communications, violates principles of net neutrality, the concept that all websites on the internet are treated equally. It would put small content providers and start-ups that don\\'t participate in it at a disadvantage, they say. \"India is a test case for a company like Facebook and what happens here will affect the roll out of this service in other smaller countries where perhaps there is not so much awareness at present,\" said Mishi Choudhary, a New York-based lawyer who works on technology and Internet advocacy issues. Also at stake is Facebook\\'s ambition to expand in its largest market outside the United States. Only 252 million of India\\'s 1.3 billion people have Internet access, making it a growth market for firms including Google and Facebook.\\n\\n\\nUber’s No-Holds-Barred Expansion Strategy Fizzles in Germany:\\xa0Uber is rapidly expanding its ride-hailing operations across the globe. But here in this city of 690,000 — less than the population of San Francisco, Uber’s hometown — the company recently did something unusual: It retreated. In early November, Uber shut its small office in Frankfurt’s centuries-old city center after just 18 months of operation, mothballing the online platform that had let people in the city hail rides through a smartphone app. The pullback was spurred in part by drivers like Hasan Kurt, the owner of a local licensed taxi business, who had refused to work with the American service. With more than 20 years of experience as a taxi operator, Mr. Kurt said he disliked how Uber barreled into Frankfurt in early 2014, using primarily unlicensed drivers who had not passed the same exams and health checks required of licensed drivers. That low-cost service, UberPop, which is similar to UberX in the United States, faced legal challenges and was eventually outlawed, last March, by German regulators. Uber then tried to recruit licensed operators like Mr. Kurt to build its service within the letter of the law. But Mr. Kurt would not budge. “It’s not part of the German culture to do something like” what Uber did, Mr. Kurt, 45, said over a cup of tea last month during a break in his busy holiday schedule. “We don’t like it, the government doesn’t like it, and our customers don’t like it.” Uber’s withdrawal from Frankfurt is just one of a multitude of retreats by the company — now valued at $62.5 billion — across Europe in recent months. In November, Uber also pulled out of Hamburg and Düsseldorf after less than two years of operating in each of those German cities. In Amsterdam, Uber recently stopped offering UberPop. And in other European cities, Uber faces the prospect of being beaten back — or at least contained. In Paris and Madrid, Uber has been confronted by often violent opposition from existing taxi operators, while in London, local regulators are mulling changes that could significantly hamper Uber’s ambitions there. Uber’s aggressive tactics also turned off potential customers like Andreas Müller, a financial analyst who tried the company’s Frankfurt service after first using Uber on a business trip in Chicago. Mr. Müller said he liked the convenience of paying through his smartphone, but soon turned against the company after reading that it had continued operating in violation of court orders and did not directly employ its drivers, who are independent contractors. “That might work in the U.S., but that’s not how things are done here in Germany,” said Mr. Müller, 37. “Everyone must respect the rules.”\\n\\n\\nIt’s Amazon and Also-Rans in Retailers’ Race for Online Sales:\\xa0Two decades after Jeffrey P. Bezos started Amazon in his Bellevue, Wash., garage, his e-commerce juggernaut could be forgiven for letting up on its rapid growth. Not Amazon, though, which steamrolled through 2015, capturing an ever-growing share of United States retail sales. Of every additional $1 Americans spent for items online this year, Amazon captured 51 cents, according to a recent estimate by analysts at Macquarie Research. And of the expected $94 billion growth in all retail sales this year — both in stores and online — Amazon took a staggering $22 billion, or almost a quarter, Ben Schachter, a retail analyst at Macquarie, calculated. Two decades after Jeffrey P. Bezos started Amazon in his Bellevue, Wash., garage, his e-commerce juggernaut could be forgiven for letting up on its rapid growth. Not Amazon, though, which steamrolled through 2015, capturing an ever-growing share of United States retail sales.

And of the expected $94 billion growth in all retail sales this year — both in stores and online — Amazon took a staggering $22 billion, or almost a quarter, Ben Schachter, a retail analyst at Macquarie, calculated. And at times, Amazon has seemed to be in danger of getting trapped in a race to the bottom that it brought on with its steep discounting. “They were just trying to sell more by underpricing everybody,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm. “But they realized they would never make any money that way. They evolved,” he said. “It’s much a different company than it was five years ago.”\\n\\n\\nBill Miller Is Misfiring on Twitter Options After Boon on Amazon:\\xa0Bill Miller turned to an unusual strategy in mounting his comeback as a top stock picker, buying options on hard-hit technology companies to make leveraged bets with a big impact on his returns. The tactic paid off in 2013 and 2014 as Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. rebounded and helped lift Miller’s $2.3 billion Legg Mason Opportunity Trust to a top ranking. The veteran manager is having less success so far with a similar wager on Twitter Inc. that he escalated last quarter, when he owned options allowing him to buy $350 million of the stock -- equal to 15 percent of the fund’s assets. The massive wager highlights how some managers are using derivatives to boost profits in mutual funds, tightly regulated investment vehicles that have strict limits on what they can invest in. The technique allows funds to make big wagers with relatively little money up front, though they can lose that money should their bet go wrong. Proponents of the strategy include bond manager Bill Gross, who has said managers need to use leverage to juice up gains in a low-return environment. “You are going to get a much bigger pop to the upside,” said Abraham Goodfriend, founder of Yedid Capital Management, a Miami Beach, Florida-based firm that employs options. “The downside is, if you are wrong you are going to lose all your money” paid for the contracts. Miller bought options on 9 million shares of Twitter in the third quarter, filings show. The drop in value of the options may be one reason the fund lost 4.6 percent over the past month and ranked among the bottom 5 percent of peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, though it’s still ahead of 95 percent for 2015. Buying options frees cash to invest elsewhere and allows a fund to bet on a large number of shares with a small down payment, boosting returns if the underlying stock gains. Miller said in an e-mailed response to questions that options occasionally provide more potential reward for the amount of risk being taken than the underlying stocks. “This almost always happens after the stock has gone down significantly, which was the case with” Amazon, Apple and Twitter, he wrote.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFew Computers Are Powerful Enough to Support Virtual Reality: VR headsets are almost ready to hit stores, but less than 1 percent of PCs will be capable of running them.\\xa0Virtual reality has a very real problem. With several technology giants preparing splashy introductions for the first VR headsets in 2016, few people own hardware capable of fully supporting Facebook’s Oculus Rift or other systems. Just 13 million PCs worldwide next year will have the graphics capabilities needed to run VR, according to an estimate by Nvidia, the largest maker of computer graphics chips. Those ultra-high-end machines account for less than 1 percent of the 1.43 billion PCs expected to be in use globally in 2016, according to research firm Gartner. VR headsets, which create immersive 3D environments the wearer can interact with and explore, are poised to be a star of CES 2016. The massive consumer electronics trade show, which kicks off in Las Vegas on Jan. 6, will have more than 40 exhibitors demonstrating VR products, a 77 percent increase from 2015. Taiwanese gadget maker HTC is expected to show off a new version of its Vive headset at CES before releasing it in stores in April. Facebook is still on track to sell its first VR product to consumers by the end of March, Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey tweeted on Dec. 22. “I think the technology has significant potential, but I also think we have to be realistic about how strongly it will be adopted in the short term,” Piers Harding-Rolls, an analyst for researcher IHS, wrote in an e-mail. “The hype is somewhat understandable considering the investment some big technology companies are making in VR. However, VR headsets come to market with a number of specific challenges.” IHS estimates that 7 million VR headsets will be in use by the end of 2016. The Consumer Technology Association, which organizes CES, forecasts VR headset sales of 1.2 million units in 2016. While that\\'s a sixfold increase from last year with total revenue of $540 million, that’s a ways short of covering the $2 billion Facebook paid for Oculus VR in 2014. There’s a very good reason why VR demands such processing power: Anything less, and you might hurl. Early VR prototypes caused many testers to suffer from motion sickness due to slight delays in the screen’s responses to the user’s movements. A standard PC game runs at 30 frames per second. But to deliver the fluid, natural motion our brains need to be convinced an image is real, VR needs to achieve 90 frames per second on two video projections (one for each eye). Right now, that means a $1,500 laptop.\\n\\n\\nApp differentiates a baby\\'s crying sounds: Why\\'s this baby crying? Well, there\\'s an app that can tell us.\\xa0It\\'s called the \\'Infant Cries Translator\\'. It was developed at Taiwan\\'s National Yunlin University of Science and Technology by a team led by Chang Chuan-Yu. \"The Infant Cries Translator can differentiate four different statuses of sounds of a baby\\'s cry, including hunger, a wet diaper, sleepiness, and pain.\" An audio recording of the baby crying is uploaded to a Cloud Drive. It\\'s then analyzed in a database of around 200,000 crying sounds Chang and his colleagues collected over two years. And moments later, the results are in......This baby\\'s hungry. Chang warns the app is not foolproof yet. But the results, he says, are promising. So far, according to our user feedback, the APP\\'s accuracy can reach to 92 percent for the babies under two weeks. As for the babies under one to two months, the APP\\'s accuracy can also reach up to 84 to 85 percent. Even for a four-month-old baby, the accuracy can reach up to 77 percent.\" The accuracy rating varies because over time the baby adapts to new conditions. But for new parents, the app can be a valuable resource.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWith Car-Sharing Service Via, Sharing More Than Just a Ride:\\xa0The back seat of a Via functions as Joanne Gamel’s mobile office. It is where Ms. Gamel, a New York real estate agent, checks email, calls clients and gets listings, all while being chauffeured to appointments in Manhattan. But the best part of a shared car service like Via is the business she does with fellow brokers who are also in the back doing the same thing. “I’ve gotten at least 15 different business cards from other agents,” said Ms. Gamel, 35. “It’s great for networking, especially if they share their listings or refer a client. I love getting in the car with another agent. And if he has a nice smile, even better.” Inside an UberPool car last month, Tanner Wells met the woman of his dreams. He was riding from a Brooklyn party back to his apartment in Manhattan when she hopped in. “We flirted on the way back to the city,” said Mr. Wells, 37. “She was telling me about some guy she was going to visit. We were talking about goofy stuff. When we got to her stop, she said, ‘It was nice meeting you,’ and got out. The driver turned to me and said, ‘Why didn’t you get her number?’” The next day Mr. Wells created a “missed connections” post on Craigslist in the hope she would find him. (So far, no answer.) Within the last year, ride-sharing services like Via, Lyft Line and UberPool have exploded onto New York streets as an alternative to pricey taxi rides and unreliable public transportation. Their fleet of S.U.V.s has created a new vision of car-pooling that is luxurious, cost-effective and timesaving. Executives are taking them to work. Parents are taking them on school runs. Packs of young professionals are taking them home after happy hour. Compared with taxis, where rides are on the decline, the price of a shared ride is worth the middle seat and constant pickups. A Via ride costs just over $5 for any two points throughout Manhattan south of 110th Street. But convenience aside, these shared cars are also prime breeding grounds for scandalous, titillating exchanges, where New Yorkers sandwiched together are networking, flirting and sparring in a seemingly consequence-free environment where nearly anything goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstacart’s crazy-growth days may be coming to an end:\\xa0the\\xa0$2 Billion Grocery Delivery Startup, Lays Off 12 In-House Recruiters: \\xa0The grocery delivery startup, which investors valued at $2 billion last year, laid off 12 in-house recruiters earlier this month, according to multiple sources. A spokeswoman confirmed the layoffs, but did not disclose how many recruiters the company still employs. In a statement, CEO Apoorva Mehta attributed the job cuts to the company’s plans to be less aggressive in hiring in 2016 than it was in 2015, when its staff tripled, from just under 100 employees to a little more than 300. A person familiar with the move, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the company likely should have employed fewer full-time recruiters and more contractors since it was unlikely that last year’s pace of hiring would continue indefinitely. Those affected by the cuts will be paid through the end of January, this person said. Instacart delivers groceries in 18 American cities from big chains like Whole Foods, Costco and Target and smaller grocers like Fairway and Zabar’s in New York City. Customers place orders through Instacart’s website or app, and the goods are whisked from local stores to customer doors, usually within an hour. A substantial portion of Instacart’s revenue originally came from marking up the in-store price of a given item, but the company now often charges the same price as the grocer, but takes a cut of the sales from the store. Earlier this year, Instacart finally began being transparent about when it was charging higher prices than its partner grocers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst Look at New Foldable Google Glass for the Workplace:\\xa0The division of Google responsible for wearable technology, Project Aura, has been hard at work on numerous iterations based on the original Glass headset. Now we’ve got a glimpse at what one of those devices may look like. In FCC filings published today, a version of Glass designed for the workplace shows a familiar-looking device with a glass prism, but equipped with a hinge so that it can be folded and placed in pockets like a standard pair of glasses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSidecar Squeezed Out by Uber and Lyft, Will Shut Down on Dec. 31:\\xa0Sidecar, the third-biggest U.S. car-hailing service, said it will end its ride and delivery operations as the company is squeezed out by better-known competitors Uber and Lyft. One of the pioneers of the ride-sharing concept, Sidecar will end its service on Dec. 31, co-founders Sunil Paul and Jahan Khanna wrote in a blog post. The move will help pave the way for the \"next big adventure in 2016,\" according to the letter. Founded four years ago, Sidecar created one of the first apps to try ride-destination tracking, discounted carpooling and deliveries that placed people and packages on the same route, according to its founders. The closely held San Francisco-based company shifted from transporting passengers to goods after struggling to compete with Uber and Lyft, according to CB Insights. \"They’re competing with very heavily funded companies, and they didn’t have the same pull with drivers that these other companies might have,\" said Nikhil Krishnan, a technology analyst at CB Insights. \"Even when it pivoted to transporting goods, it still had to compete with Postmates, and even Uber is transporting goods.\" Sidecar has raised about $35 million, according to Margaret Ryan, a company spokeswoman. That number pales in comparison to venture capital raised by Uber and Lyft. Bloomberg News reported earlier this month that Uber is seeking $2.1 billion in a financing round that would value the car-booking company at $62.5 billion. Lyft, the No. 2 ride-hailing service, is currently seeking to raise $500 million, according to fundraising documents obtained by Bloomberg last month. Sidecar’s investors include Union Square Ventures, Google Ventures, and Richard Branson.\\n\\n\\nFoodpanda India to sack about 330 employees:\\xa0Foodpanda India is laying off one in seven staffers, continuing its clean-up drive after allegations of operational irregularities rattled the Rocket Internet-owned food ordering marketplace. The company said on Tuesday it will sack 15 per cent of its employees, or 330 people, as increased automation of 98 per cent in order processing has reduced the need for staffers. Foodpanda joins a raft of food-tech startups such as Zomato and TinyOwl in laying off employees amid a tightening in fund flow from investors due to high cash burn and growing profitability concerns. Before the job cuts, Foodpanda had 2,200 employees on its rolls. The company said it will provide affected employees due remuneration and help them explore job options.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUniversities Race to Nurture Start-Up Founders of the Future:\\xa0\\xa0Ten years ago, it may have sufficed to offer a few entrepreneurship courses, workshops and clubs. But undergraduates, driven by a sullen job market and inspired by billion-dollar success narratives from Silicon Valley, now expect universities to teach them how to convert their ideas into business or nonprofit ventures. As a result, colleges — and elite institutions in particular — have become engaged in an innovation arms race. Harvard opened an Innovation Lab in 2011 that has helped start more than 75 companies. Last year, New York University founded a campus entrepreneurs’ lab, and this year Northwestern University opened a student start-up center, the Garage.

In a further cost-cutting move, it will also shutter its data center in California and migrate to the cloud. The company moved into China eight years when it acquired local professional social network Tianji.com, but that site will cease to exist on December 31. Viadeo claims that Tianji has 25 million users, but it has struggled to attract the “very considerable development resources” necessary to drive it forward in “China’s fiercely competitive market”. Viadeo had planned to use one-third of the proceeds from its 2014 IPO to develop Tianji.com, but the listing didn’t raise enough capital and the firm wasn’t able to pull in money from private investors. Post-China, Viadeo said it will refocus on its home market of France and other French-speaking countries, while putting great emphasis on its B2B sales model. Viadeo’s foray into China was a fascinating one, since it doubled down on the country in 2011, a time when Twitter and Facebook were heavily linked with opening local operations there. The company two-sided play — having a global site (Viadeo.com) and a China-only one (Tianji.com) — was a model that both of the U.S. social networks had reportedly shown interest in. In contrast to Viadeo’s troubles in China, LinkedIn seems to be finding some success there. The U.S. social network opened a joint-venture with Sequoia China last year. LinkedIn China isn’t a totally separate site, but it does block some content from China based on the country’s web censorship regulations.\\n\\n\\nFacebook Pitches Free Basics to India as Net Neutrality Activists Clash With Facebook:\\xa0Facebook Chairman Mark Zuckerberg made a personal appeal in one of India’s leading newspapers for the country to allow a free Internet service that has stirred controversy and invited questions from regulators. Facebook’s proposed Free Basics plan allows customers to access the social network and other services such as education, health care, and employment listings from their phones without a data plan. Yet activists say the program threatens the principles of net neutrality and could change pricing in India for access to different websites. The backlash in India centers on net neutrality, the principle that all Internet websites should be equally accessible. Critics accused the world’s largest social networking company of favoring a limited swath of the Internet and excluding rival services. And Facebook’s broader Internet.org initiative, including Free Basics, is seen as an effective way to draw more users onto a social network already used by over a billion people. Zuckerberg’s Facebook is spending billions of dollars on Internet.org, including projects to deliver the Web to under-served areas via drones, satellites and lasers. The billionaire co-founder has said Facebook or its partners will not make money off this initiative and that the goal is to bring Internet access to the developing world and alleviate poverty. “This isn’t about Facebook’s commercial interests – there aren’t even any ads in the version of Facebook in Free Basics,” Zuckerberg wrote in an opinion piece in the Times of India. “If people lose access to free basic services they will simply lose access to the opportunities offered by the Internet today.” This month, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India asked in a “consultation paper” whether telecommunications service providers should be allowed to charge different pricing for data usage on websites, applications and platforms. The initial comment period for the Indian consultation paper ends Dec. 30. Activists have argued that Free Basics is a “land grab on government property” and that with data rates in India already being low, eventually “everybody will be on the full and open Internet.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTVF and AIB, Stars of India’s Online Video Scene Struggle to Make a Living:\\xa0It’s not just the streaming video services that are struggling to make a profit in India. Even the country’s most popular YouTube stars have trouble making a living from digital video. The Viral Fever, a troupe of actors that creates TV-style episodic comedies, has one of the country’s most popular channels on YouTube, with about 1.3 million subscribers. Its most recent series, “Pitchers,” focused on a group of young tech workers trying to decide whether to form their own start-up. But the ad revenue from YouTube is so low that the group, known as T.V.F., has turned to sponsors like Kingfisher beer and Pond’s cold cream for funding to create its shows. T.V.F. also makes corporate videos and does live comedy shows at Indian colleges to help pay the bills. All India Bakchod, a four-man comedy troupe, has had similar challenges. The group has produced videos making fun of topics like Bollywood, Indian weddings and politics and has nearly 1.5 million followers on its YouTube channel. About two months ago, A.I.B. finally hit the big time, when Star India, a group of television channels owned by 21st Century Fox, began airing a weekly news satire show starring the group on its Hotstar app and on TV. Mr. Joshi said that A.I.B. essentially breaks even on video production costs and makes extra income from branded content it creates for Red Bull, Xbox and Quiksilver.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

The service, which lets consumers pay in an app or by tapping their iPhone on store terminals, will be introduced next year in China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Spain. Apple is counting on its brand recognition as it enters markets that are further along than the U.S. in all things mobile payments, particularly in advanced technologies needed to accept them in retail outlets. Still, it won’t be easy. The iPhone maker will compete with local banks and Internet companies that already offer the service -- not to mention Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s leader in smartphones. The mobile-payment service, which only works with Apple devices, is a way for the company to make products more appealing and spur customer loyalty. After Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook called 2015 the “year of Apple Pay” in January, the service has been slow to take off domestically, partly because of a lack of promotion and a limited number of store terminals able to accept it. China: Apple said its service will be rolled out as soon as early 2016. \\xa0 Last week, Apple teamed up with Chinese bank-card association UnionPay, which will make Apple’s market entry “a lot easier,” said James Wester, an analyst at researcher IDC. Still, Apple Pay will compete with services like Tencent’s WeChat and Alibaba’s Alipay that control more than 75 percent of the mobile-payments market. And Apple should be prepared to race with Samsung, which also announced a partnership with UnionPay and plans to bring Samsung Pay to China as soon as early 2016.\\n\\n\\nJet.com’s Strategy: Low Prices, Fast Delivery, Happy Workers:\\xa0You can’t accuse Jet.com of timidity. Jet has had some bumps and turns since last summer, when it began selling products as varied as cans of chili, exercise bikes and WowWee personal robots. It changed its business model, dropping a membership fee. It is burning through cash as it continues to scale up, now with more than 900 employees. When it went out to raise more money in the fall, it encountered skepticism. A week before Christmas, it told some customers they would not get their orders in time. Jet said only about 500 shipments out of a million were affected, but such admissions never look good. Yet Marc Lore, Jet’s founder and chief executive, says he is not worried. What will separate Jet from Fab and every other failed company, he says, is happiness. In particular, employee happiness. “I’m constantly asking people at Jet if they’re happy,” he said. “It’s really important for me to know that they love working here and think this is the best place they’ve ever worked.” Jet supplies its employees with typical start-up perks like free food (weekly lunches, plus Red Bull in the refrigerator and protein powder in the kitchen cabinet), four months of paid parental leave, unlimited vacation and an ownership stake that could one day be worth a lot. But it also has some decidedly less common policies, like standardized, no-negotiation pay packages and worker-friendly employment agreements. Employees can see, every day, how the business is doing. “Transparency” is a big word with Mr. Lore. So is “fairness.” Make people feel good, he says, and they will do their best. Trust them and they will reward you. As the holiday shopping season was beginning in late November, Mr. Lore convened his top executives in Jet’s Hoboken, N.J., headquarters for their regular weekly meeting. Here are some of the things that were not on the agenda: warehouse logistics, customer concerns, fine-tuning prices, potential shipping bottlenecks, supplier issues or any of a dozen other topics that could have bedeviled Jet’s first December. Instead, the executives discussed the mood and well-being of Jet’s employees. The preliminary results of Jet’s first “Happiness Pulse” were in. More than 500 employees responded to the survey, which means basically everyone who had been at Jet for at least a month. Two-thirds of them said they viewed Jet favorably. Only 4 percent had a negative opinion. “So only 25 people are basically unhappy,” Mr. Lore said. In an interview a few weeks after Jet’s official debut in July, Mr. Lore pulled out his phone and opened an app. It showed that Jet sold $667,200 in gross merchandise value in one day, up 89 percent in a month. Jet had 6,100 first-time buyers the previous day, and 7,800 orders. The company had $153 million in cash. The app is bulging with data, and it is available to investors and the salaried — but not the hourly — employees. Some information is available even to casual visitors. Dominating one wall in the reception area in Hoboken is a board posting constant updates of the day’s sales by number and dollar volume. For technology companies, this is radical openness. Also radical is a practice to keep salaries the same for jobs grouped together, a process called “leveling.” This is meant to rule out the common ploy “I got a job offer, can you match it?” Extroverts who promote themselves and introverts who keep their heads down are paid the same for jobs of the same value to the company.\\n\\n\\nCommon Stock Ownership Spreads Among Start-Up Investors:\\xa0When institutional investors put money into companies backed by venture capital, they typically end up owning a type of stock called preferred shares. Now, institutional investors are also becoming owners of a different class of start-up stock: common shares. The competition among investors to get into hot start-ups has been so fierce that many hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds and others have been unable to participate when the up-and-coming companies sold preferred shares, a kind of stock that generally comes with many protections. So to make sure they got a stake in private companies like Palantir Technologies, Dropbox and One Kings Lane, the institutional investors instead began buying common stock — generally owned by employees of start-ups — often from workers directly or from platforms that sell employee shares. In doing so, the investors chose to forgo the protections that come with preferred shares. Common stock usually comes with no guarantees and is paid out only after the preferred shareholders get their money. The spreading of common stock may have some unintended consequences, especially as the air begins to come out of the Silicon Valley boom and some companies get sold for modest amounts of money. For one, institutional investors who own common stock could take home much less than other investors in the same company who have preferred shares. That gap, in turn, could lead to more litigation between investors.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndian Regulators Suspend Facebook’s Free Basic Services:\\xa0\\xa0Telecommunications regulators in India have ordered the suspension of Facebook’s controversial program to bring free basic Internet services to mobile phone users in the country. Facebook’s program, called Free Basics, is one of the signature projects of Internet.org, the company’s ambitious plan to bring the Internet to the billions of people around the world who do not have it. Under the initiative, the company works in partnership with local telephone carriers in 35 countries to offer free access to a text-only version of the Facebook social network as well as to certain news, health, job and other services. The idea is to give novices a taste of the Internet and encourage them to buy paid data services when they want to explore the Internet more widely. But critics say that by offering a free package of handpicked services, Facebook and its partners are discouraging people from using competing services and violating the principle of net neutrality, which calls for telecommunications carriers to treat all Internet services equally. In India, for example, the program offers free web searches using Microsoft’s Bing service but Google searches incur a charge. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has been particularly keen to expand Free Basics in India, which already has more Facebook users than any other country except the United States. Facebook has waged an aggressive advertising campaign in newspapers and on its own social network to build support for the program. But Facebook has encountered a series of setbacks, including intense opposition from net neutrality advocates, the poor marketing efforts and weak network of its Indian phone partner, and skepticism from regulators. One of those regulators, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, has now told Reliance Communications, Facebook’s partner in India, to stop offering Free Basics. The order — which was quietly issued about two weeks ago but leaked to the Indian news media this week — came after Reliance failed to turn over information about the terms and conditions of the service, which it had planned to expand across the country beginning last month.\\n\\n\\nWhen a Unicorn Start-Up Stumbles, Its Employees Get Hurt:\\xa0\\xa0On Sept. 4, employees of Good Technology, a mobile security start-up in Sunnyvale, Calif., awoke to discover that their company was being sold to BlackBerry, the mobile device and software maker. Some workers immediately began trying to figure out what it meant for Good to abandon its long-anticipated plan to go public — a move that would have potentially turned their shares in the start-up into gold. They didn’t get firm answers that day, but the prospects did not look great. In an investor document about the sale that was distributed to shareholders, employees discovered their Good stock was valued at 44 cents a share, down from $4.32 a year earlier. In contrast, preferred stock owned by Good’s venture capitalists was worth almost seven times as much, more than $3 a share. The paperwork also showed that Good’s board had turned down an $825 million cash offer just six months earlier, in March. For some employees, it meant that their shares were practically worthless. Even worse, they had paid taxes on the stock based on the higher value. A few nights after the investor document went around, a glass conference room wall at Good’s headquarters was broken, according to an incident report. At a subsequent company meeting, Ms. Wyatt told employees that counselors were available to talk to people who needed to vent. “Many employees may not recover what they’ve lost,” said Matthew Parks, Good’s director of cloud products, who has worked at the company since 2006. His Good shares are now worth a fraction of the six-figure tax bill that he paid for the stock allotted to him before the company was sold. What Good’s employees experienced is an example of who loses out when a company backed by venture capital goes south. While plenty of people — including founders, top executives and investors — are involved in the rise of a start-up, those hit the hardest during a company’s fall are the rank-and-file employees. Investors and executives generally get protections in a start-up that employees do not. Many investors have preferred stock, a class of shares that can come with a guaranteed payout. Executives frequently get special bonuses so they will not leave during deal talks. In Good’s case, the six investors on the board had preferred shares worth a combined $125 million. After the sale to BlackBerry, Ms. Wyatt, who has since left the company, took home $4 million, as well as a $1.9 million severance payment, according to investor documents. In contrast, start-up employees generally own common stock, whose payout comes only after those who hold preferred shares get their money. In Good’s case, the board’s preferred stock was worth almost the same as all 227 million common shares outstanding. Missing out on the upside of the sale was bad enough, but that wasn’t the half of it. Some Good employees actually lost money when BlackBerry bought the company. Good was a unicorn, that is, a private company with a valuation of more than $1 billion. The high valuation increased the paper value of employee shares — and thus the income tax bills levied on their stock when they received the stock grants, or when they bought and sold shares. To pay those taxes, some employees emptied savings accounts and borrowed money. Some of Good’s common shareholders have sued most of the board for a breach of fiduciary duty, asserting that directors looked after the interests of only preferred shareholders.\\n\\n\\nPalantir Technologies raises $880 million from investors:\\xa0Palantir Technologies, a data analytics and security company that helps government agencies track down terrorists and uncover financial fraud, said on Wednesday it has raised $880 million in its latest financing round. Founded in 2004, Palantir, which is considered Silicon Valley\\'s most secretive company, does highly confidential work for U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. Its data mining system, which uses algorithms to search for patterns and connections, helped the U.S. government track down al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. The company\\'s large staff of consultants also work with large businesses, police departments, banks and branches of the U.S. military. Palantir has raised close to $2 billion from investors. Its valuation earlier this month reached $20 billion, up from $15 billion in late 2014, making it the fourth-highest-valued, venture-backed private tech company in the world. The company has bucked growing skepticism among late-stage investors about plowing millions into highly valuable companies. Other \"unicorns,\" or venture-backed companies ostensibly worth $1 billion or more, have watched their valuations come under heightened scrutiny. Palantir\\'s strong government ties and an annual revenue estimated by some at more about $1 billion likely set it apart from other cash-burning startups. The company was co-founded by Peter Thiel and Joe Lonsdale, two of Silicon Valley\\'s more influential investors and entrepreneurs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nElon Musk\\'s SpaceX Successfully Lands Rocket After Launch of Satellites Into Orbit:\\xa0People living along the central Atlantic coast of Florida have for decades enjoyed the spectacle of rockets headed for space. On Monday night, they were treated to a new sight that may become common: a rocket coming back down to a gentle landing. “It really felt like it was right on top of us,” Elon Musk, the chief executive of Space Exploration Technologies Corporation of Hawthorne, Calif., or SpaceX for short, said during a telephone news conference afterward. For SpaceX, the 8:29 p.m. liftoff of the Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station was a threefold success. First, it marked the company’s return to flight after half a year. In SpaceX’s last launch attempt, a rocket taking supplies to the International Space Station disintegrated. Second, SpaceX’s upgraded design for its Falcon 9 rocket worked flawlessly. The liquid oxygen was chilled to minus 340 degrees Fahrenheit, about 40 degrees colder than on earlier flights, and the kerosene fuel was cooled to 20 degrees instead of 70 degrees. Most significant to SpaceX’s ambitions, however, is that after the second stage of the rocket with the satellites continued on to orbit, the engines of the booster stage reignited to turn it around, back to Cape Canaveral. Currently, most rockets are launched just once, the boosters falling back to Earth as expensive junk. Making spaceflight more like air travel, with rockets capable of being refueled and sent up again, is essential for SpaceX’s long-term goal of sending people to Mars. “It’s all the difference in the world,” Mr. Musk said, “absolutely fundamental.”\\n\\n\\nGoogle, Ford in talks on self-driving car partnership: source: Google and Ford Motor Co are in talks about forming a partnership to develop autonomous car technology, a person briefed on the matter said on Tuesday. The extent of a partnership between the second-largest U.S. automaker and search engine giant Alphabet Inc remains under discussion and the precise framework of any effort is unclear but it could include jointly building and developing cars. The two sides have been talking for months, the source said. A partnership between a major automaker and Google could speed the introduction of self-driving vehicles by giving the car company access to Google\\'s wealth of software development while Google would benefit from the industrial and automotive know-how of a firm such as Ford. Fully autonomous cars could eventually prevent thousands of crashes, deaths and injuries, reduce oil use through better traffic management and extend personal mobility to people unable to drive.\\n\\n\\nJet.com Misses Last-Minute Christmas Sales and Shows Downside of Its Model:\\xa0The heavily funded e-commerce startup began notifying customers 10 days before Christmas that it could not guarantee delivery by the holiday, citing “nationwide shipping delays that have affected many of our shipping partners.” On December 16, Jet.com added an alert to the top of its homepage. The company has still been guaranteeing two-day delivery for items it ships out of its own warehouses, but those are mostly household goods like toilet paper, detergent and packaged groceries that are typically not bought as gifts.While Jet.com is less than six months old, the incident highlights one big downside of its current model compared to Amazon’s. Jet’s pitch is that its large network of warehousing partners helps it choose the most efficient way to fulfill an order, thus stripping out excess costs and passing along discounts of 5 percent to 10 percent to shoppers if they order multiple items at once. But the model also means Jet doesn’t currently have as much control over the experience shoppers have after they complete a purchase for a large number of orders. Some items on Amazon also come from someone else’s warehouse. But Amazon can still guarantee two-day shipping on more than 20 million items through Amazon Prime, thanks to its huge Fulfillment by Amazon program that lets merchants store goods with Amazon for a fee.\\n\\n\\nGoogle Calls Its New Ad Option for App Developers \\'an Install-Seeking Machine\\'\\xa0Google says developers running \"universal app campaigns\" across its network are finding them to be more cost-effective than ads run than other digital platforms. The Adwords-based campaign option, which Google introduced in September, allows developers to run a campaign across Google search, YouTube, Google Play store and the Google Display network. A developer designates a target cost per install and budget, and then Google automates where across its platforms the promos should go.\"Basically, think of it as an install-seeking machine,\" Anthony Chavez, Google\\'s product management director for mobile ads and Universal App Campaigns, told Adweek. As an example, Google pointed to Sparkpeople, which has 15 million users in the U.S. and Canada for its fitness and dieting apps and has been testing the sytem. Joe Robb, the digital marketing director for the company, said that while the cost per install has been slightly higher than he expected, his team is still spending between 30 and 50 percent less than they do on Facebook. The campaign is also now driving about 20 percent of the company\\'s total downloads.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCisco reviews code after Juniper code backdoor found; more scrutiny expected:\\xa0Networking equipment maker Cisco said on Monday it has launched a product review to look for tampering after rival Juniper Networks\\'s disclosure found code in firewall software that made it vulnerable to cyber attacks. Juniper warned customers on Thursday that it had uncovered \"unauthorized code\" in its firewall software, saying it could be exploited to allow an attacker to unscramble encrypted communications that travel through the security devices. That prompted the code review by Cisco. Security experts said they expect other technology companies to conduct similar investigations after last week\\'s unprecedented news from Juniper. It was the first time a major technology firm discovered the addition of an unauthorized \\'back door,\" or code that could be exploited to facilitate cyber attacks, according to security experts. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it was investigating how the Juniper \"back door\" might impact government networks.\\n\\n\\nToshiba Plans to Cut 7,800 Jobs as It Warns of Huge Loss:\\xa0\\xa0Toshiba warned on Monday that it would incur its largest net loss ever as it tries to restructure a stable of unprofitable businesses. The Japanese company, whose financial struggles were laid bare this year in a $1.2 billion accounting scandal, said it would eliminate 7,800 jobs, mostly in its slumping consumer electronics division. That brings the number of job cuts announced this year to more than 10,000 total, or roughly 5 percent of its work force. Shedding workers is expensive in Japan, where the majority of employees enjoy legal protection from layoffs. Toshiba will have to negotiate voluntary buyouts instead, a process it said would contribute to a loss of 550 billion yen, or $4.5 billion, in the financial year ending in March. The bookkeeping scandal has been an embarrassment for corporate Japan. Though wrongdoing by businesses is hardly unheard-of here, Toshiba was among the bluest of blue-chip companies, featuring on a prominent index of businesses believed to combine profitability with clean, modern corporate governance. Instead, it turned out that the company had been massaging its earnings since the global financial crisis took hold in 2008. A committee of investigators hired by the company concluded in the summer that it had engaged in a “systematic cover-up.” The committee found problems in virtually all corners of Toshiba’s business, which encompasses products as various as refrigerators and nuclear power plants. Half the company’s board of directors stepped down. The more than 150 billion yen in profit overstatement discovered by the committee was equal to about a third of the pretax profits that Toshiba reported during the seven-year period under scrutiny.\\n\\n\\nEricsson signs patent deal with Apple, shares soar:\\xa0Swedish mobile telecom gear maker Ericsson said it had signed a patent license deal with Apple Inc over technology that helps smartphones and tablets connect to mobile networks, sending its shares up much as 8 percent. The deal ends a year-long dispute with Apple, one of the biggest legal battles in mobile technology and Ericson said it would pave the way for cooperation between the companies on future technologies. Ericsson had said in its filing to a U.S. district court in January that Apple\\'s license to use the technology developed by the Swedish firm had expired, and that two years of negotiations had not led to a new deal. Ericsson on Monday estimated overall revenue from intellectual property rights in 2015 would hit 13 to 14 billion crowns ($1.52-$1.64 billion) up from 9.9 billion in 2014 as a result of the agreement.\\n\\n\\nUber\\'s Rival Lyft Plans to Raise Up to $1 Billion in New Funds:\\xa0Ride-hailing company Lyft plans to raise as much as $1 billion in new funds, according to a Delaware state filing, in a round of financing analysts said could sharply boost the valuation of Uber’s largest U.S. rival. Lyft didn’t indicate in the Friday evening filing how much had been raised, who was investing in the round or list a valuation. Sven Weber, a financial filings expert, pegged the pre-money valuation at about $4.5 billion while Justin Byers at VC Experts estimates it closer to $3.9 billion. Lyft was valued at $2.5 billion when it announced a previous funding round in March. The latest fundraising round contained some downside protection for new investors, including the provision of extra shares should Lyft go public at a lower valuation. Lyft is competing aggressively with Uber, which recently filed to raise $2.1 billion at a $62.5 billion valuation. The discrepancies in the valuations reflect Uber’s pole position in the U.S. and its global ambitions. On Dec. 3, Lyft said it was teaming up with Uber’s biggest rivals in Asia, including China’s Didi Kuaidi, Singapore’s GrabTaxi, India’s Ola, to form a global alliance that will make their apps cross-compatible for travelers. Lyft lost $127 million in the first half of 2015 on $46.7 million in revenue, according to fundraising documents obtained by Bloomberg. It said last month it has gained market share in key markets such as San Francisco, and has a gross revenue “run rate” of $1 billion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon in talks to lease Boeing jets to launch air-cargo business: report:\\xa0Amazon.com is negotiating to lease 20 Boeing Co (BA.N) 767 jets to start its own air-delivery service next month, seeking to avoid delays from third-party carriers, the Seattle Times reported, citing cargo-industry executives. Amazon has approached several cargo-aircraft lessors to line up the planes, the newspaper reported on Friday, citing a senior aircraft-leasing company executive familiar with matter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba Heads Into 2016 Struggling With Knock-Off Reputation: Cash-strapped Star Wars fans can pick up Darth Vader figurines and light sabers for as little as $4.59. Tom Brady jerseys go for about a 10th of those on the National Football League’s store. A pair of red Beats Solo headphones can be had for just $107 -- about half its official price. It’s bargains galore at Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Taobao: the EBay-like bazaar where buyers meet up with sellers. Billionaire Chairman Jack Ma is struggling to shake the company’s reputation as a haven for cheap knock-offs and unauthorized merchandise, 21 months after calling counterfeits cancerous. He heads into 2016 after a bruising year that saw more than $50 billion wiped off its market value amid lawsuits and criticism from Chinese and U.S. regulators. Cleaning up its image next year is crucial to Alibaba’s goal of winning the trust of merchants and shoppers overseas, from where Jack Ma wants to get more than half the company’s revenue within a decade. A cooling Chinese economy makes that effort even more pressing. At home, JD.com Inc. is winning customers partly because it holds the inventory itself and sells directly to consumers, similar to Amazon, a business model easier to police and regulate, said Michelle Ma, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “By now, management should have eliminated this problem,” said Cyrus Mewawalla, managing director of London-based CM Research. “The fact that they haven’t is a worrying sign forinvestors.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTheranos Founder Faces a Test of Technology, and Reputation:\\xa0Last year, as the deadly and highly contagious Ebola virus threatened to spread around the globe, Theranos, a Silicon Valley start-up, was scrambling to find a test that could quickly detect if a person was infected. This was exactly the sort of thing the company was supposed to do. Its fundamental promise was to revolutionize laboratory testing by offering hundreds of different blood tests that could be done through a simple finger stick for a fraction of the cost of typical lab blood work. More than that, Elizabeth Holmes, who started the company in 2003, had a higher-minded purpose. She also wanted to defeat epidemics. The company devoted significant resources to the Ebola effort. “We stopped everything for Ebola — for the world,” says Richard Kovacevich, the former chief executive of Wells Fargo, who joined Theranos as a director in 2013. And then, nothing. Even as other companies received approval from regulators, Theranos watched from the sidelines. “I have no doubt we would have” gotten the green light for the tests, Mr. Kovacevich said. But the crisis ebbed, and the company says getting approval for that test is no longer a priority. Now, after a surprise inspection last summer, the Food and Drug Administration is requiring that Theranos’s equipment and individual tests go through the regulatory process and get approval. This will determine whether its foundational technology is a reality — or, like that Ebola test, an unfulfilled grand promise. While Theranos says it has conducted millions of tests, largely through a partnership with Walgreens, the drugstore chain, no one from outside Theranos has ever verified the technology. Institutions whose names were often linked with Theranos, like the Cleveland Clinic, insist they have not yet had a chance to use the technology. It has struggled to forge business relationships with other potential partners, like Safeway.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter Stock Closes at an All-Time Low:\\xa0Twitter stock fell 4 percent Thursday, finishing the session at $23.31, the lowest the stock has ever closed. Yahoo Finance lists the stock’s 52-week low at $21.01, but that was during intra-day trading back in August (the stock closed at $25.17 that day). The stock market was crummy in general on Thursday. But it has also been a tough quarter for Twitter, which has dropped 11 percent since Jack Dorsey was named CEO back in early October. Twitter announced last week that it would finally start showing ads to its logged-out audience, which created a nice stock spike, but it’s clear that investors are looking for more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWaze Could Be Google’s Ace in the Hole in a Self-Driving Car War With Uber: It’s 2025. You’re in a big city and have somewhere to be. Fire up an app and an autonomous car — with a driver at the wheel or maybe without one — picks you up. Odds are good the company behind that car will be Uber or Google. The two are set to vie for the reigning position as the transit service platform of the future. Uber has advantages — for one, its name is becoming the verb for ride-hailing, the way Google’s has for search. But Google has the mobile platform, the lead in self-driving tech and deeper pockets. It has another edge: Deep ties with local governments, critical players in making autonomous vehicles a reality. This proximity is thanks to Waze, the mapping startup Google bought in 2013, which has invested heavily in building data-sharing agreements with cities around the world. If autonomous cars are going to work, there needs to be tight coordination of transit data between governments and private companies. Before you can hail a self-driving car, there’ll likely need to be a host of things (designated lanes, re-zonings, ordinances) that let it drive itself. Then there is the planning to ensure they drive effectively. That’s why Google has cut data deals with its flagship mapping product, and why Uber is scrambling to build similar programs. Waze is, from what we can tell, ahead. In its program, called the Connected Citizens Program, Waze hands over info reported by its users, like accidents and road closures, to urban governments free of charge. It has cut deals with 51 cities worldwide; they get fresh data from the app’s users every two minutes. For cities, the program gives them timely, unprecedented data that helps manage traffic flows, safety and (ideally) costs. In Boston, a city not known for its sober traffic design, officials are using Waze data to measure the impact of their planning changes. “We heard that traffic improved anecdotally,” said Connor McKay, a data scientist for the city. “Now we can say that, quantitatively, traffic has improved.” In return, cities give Waze their own traffic data. (This is why you may see some Uber drivers using Waze to get around.) Accurate road information is critical to making self-driving cars work — hence, Uber hurriedly pouring its investor stockpile into a mapping operation. The ballooning ride-hailing startup has had less success currying favor with city officials. It has proved it can get its way in cities, but usually after some messy standoffs. This summer, Waze rolled out its first flirtation with Uber’s turf: A trial in Tel Aviv that lets Waze users pick up passengers along their commute routes. It has since expanded to a few suburbs around the city. A Waze rep would only share that the Google unit is “quite pleased with the results.” Waze also insists that its trial is not like Uber — drivers aren’t making money, and the program is framed as a way for cities to tackle congestion problems. It’s a key framing. When governments begin to approach autonomy, they are likely to turn to tech partners they know best.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow Intelligent Lighting Is Ushering In The Internet Of Buildings:\\xa0\\xa0The LED revolution is over. To no one’s surprise, LEDs have won. Solid-state lighting is changing how we light the world, successfully displacing traditional illumination sources across every part of the global lighting market. Over the next few years, billions of sockets will be in play. This transition has kicked off a new phase of LED adoption — the race to connect every socket. The stakes are high for consumers and vendors alike. A trifecta of qualities — ubiquity, network connectivity and access to power — make intelligent lights a perfect platform on which the promise of the Internet of Things can start to come to life. Behind the scenes, this race to own sockets is really a contest to see who will control the infrastructure of the IoT across our built environment. These intelligent, networked, sensor-laden lights of the near future will form the central nervous system of every smart building. Beyond simple illumination, this “Internet of Buildings” built on top of next-generation lighting systems will forever change the way we interact with the spaces in which we live. In your kids’ elementary school, biometric sensors will track students’ alertness, subtly shifting spectrum to automatically boost their focus any time it starts to wane. Around the corner at the grocery store, beacons embedded in connected fixtures will track every movement you (or your mobile phone) make — from produce to dairy — beaming coupons at you along the way. Even the lights around your home will be intelligent, learning from and responding to the steady stream of data generated by your wearable devices — using light to help de-stress you after a long day or to perk you up on a cold, dark winter morning. Consumer-facing tech giants — Apple, Google, Amazon — see residential lighting as a key step toward the connected home. Why settle for one or two thermostats or smart toasters when you can gather data from dozens of sensor-enabled lights scattered throughout every house and apartment? For networking companies — Cisco, Qualcomm and their ilk — intelligent lighting is an infrastructure play. Billions of connected lights will need new routing fabric, if only to handle the massive amount of new data traffic they will produce. Even the largest building management systems companies — Siemens, Honeywell, Schneider, Johnson Controls — see the threat posed to their core businesses in HVAC and physical security as the next generation of intelligent buildings are built on top of new lighting networks. Of course, the traditional lighting players — Acuity, Philips, GE — are deeply engaged in this shift, too. But their success is far from guaranteed. The land grab is on. Who will win?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBig IPO, Tiny Payout for Many Startup Workers:\\xa0Side deals and volatile shares make stock options a bigger gamble for startup employees.The frustrated expectations of early employees have become a common thread in the latest round of technology IPOs. It used to be “the get-rich story happened for people who joined in the early days,” says Saar Gur, general partner at Charles River Ventures. Now they can be among the few left behind. Many executives, early investors, and even later investors are able to cash out before the rank and file, or bargain for guarantees that help ensure a bonanza. Whatever happens with an IPO, executives tend to hang on to enough equity to guarantee huge payouts when they sell their shares. Most early investors get a chance to sell options on secondary markets before a company’s IPO. Later investors increasingly demand preferential treatment, including agreements that if an IPO underperforms the terms of their investment, they’ll be made whole with an equivalent amount of additional shares. Late-stage investors in both Box and Square had such so-called ratchet agreements in place, further devaluing locked-up employee equity. When those kinds of deals are in place, employees often find their payouts disappointing because they’re so diluted, says Clara Sieg, a partner at Revolution Ventures. Box and Square declined to comment for this story. Ordinary employees are typically without meaningful financial protections or even a clear sense of what their equity stakes mean, says Chris Zaharis, who’s worked at startups for about 20 years and as a volunteer teaches people about their equity rights. Options grants often don’t come with information on strike prices (discounts on shares), preferential treatment, or even the total number of shares outstanding. “People on average overestimate what they are going to make by about 10X,” he says.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDriverless Cars Have A Crash Rate Twice As High As Regular Cars - Because They Always Follow The Rules. They \\xa0The self-driving car, that cutting-edge creation that’s supposed to lead to a world without accidents, is achieving the exact opposite right now: The vehicles have racked up a crash rate double that of those with human drivers. The glitch? They obey the law all the time, as in, without exception. This may sound like the right way to program a robot to drive a car, but good luck trying to merge onto a chaotic, jam-packed highway with traffic flying along well above the speed limit. It tends not to work out well. As the accidents have piled up -- all minor scrape-ups for now -- the arguments among programmers at places like Google \\xa0and Carnegie Mellon University are heating up: Should they teach the cars how to commit infractions from time to time to stay out of trouble? “It’s a constant debate inside our group,” said Raj Rajkumar, co-director of the General Motors-Carnegie Mellon Autonomous Driving Collaborative Research Lab in Pittsburgh. Turns out, though, their accident rates are twice as high as for regular cars, according to a study by the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Driverless vehicles have never been at fault, the study found: They’re usually hit from behind in slow-speed crashes by inattentive or aggressive humans unaccustomed to machine motorists that always follow the rules and proceed with caution. Last year, Rajkumar offered test drives to members of Congress in his lab’s self-driving Cadillac SRX sport utility vehicle. The Caddy performed perfectly, except when it had to merge onto I-395 South and swing across three lanes of traffic in 150 yards (137 meters) to head toward the Pentagon. The car’s cameras and laser sensors detected traffic in a 360-degree view but didn’t know how to trust that drivers would make room in the ceaseless flow, so the human minder had to take control to complete the maneuver.\\n\\n\\nBrazil court lifts suspension of Facebook\\'s WhatsApp service:\\xa0A Brazilian judge on Thursday ordered the lifting of a 48-hour suspension of the services in Brazil of Facebook Inc\\'s WhatsApp phone-messaging application, overturning an order from a lower court. The ban, which went into effect at midnight Wednesday, lasted about 12 hours until an appeals court judge overturned it. The interruption of WhatsApp\\'s text message and Internet telephone service caused outrage in Latin America\\'s largest country, where the company estimates it has 100 million personal users, and led to angry exchanges on the floor of Congress. WhatsApp is installed on 92.5 percent of Android devices in Brazil, making it the most installed app in the country, according to SimilarWeb, an internet intelligence and marketing company. Rival messaging system Telegram said on Twitter that it received 1 million downloads in Brazil in one day due to the outage. Telegram was installed on 2.35 percent of android devices before the blackout and Facebook Messenger on 74 percent, SimilarWeb said. A judge in Sao Bernardo do Campo, an industrial suburb of Sao Paulo, had ordered the suspension of WhatsApp\\'s services from midnight on Wednesday (0200 GMT Thursday). The order was made after the California-based company, despite a fine, failed to comply with two judicial rulings to share information in a criminal case.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nApple names Jeff Williams COO, a job once held by Tim Cook:\\xa0Apple Inc promoted longtime executive Jeff Williams to the role of chief operating officer, reinstating the title previously held by Chief Executive Tim Cook, as part of a series of changes to the company\\'s leadership team. Williams, who joined Apple in 1998, previously served as senior vice president of operations and oversaw development of the Apple Watch, the company\\'s first new product since the iPad. \"Jeff is hands-down the best operations executive I\\'ve ever worked with,\" Cook said in a statement. While it was unclear if the appointment meant Apple was grooming Williams to be Cook\\'s successor, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a source, that the move did not necessarily signal that.\\n\\n\\nYelp, OpenTable part ways amid heightened competition:\\xa0Review site Yelp Inc and restaurant reservation service OpenTable have quietly ended a long-running partnership, the companies confirmed on Thursday, as the one-time allies increasingly eye each other\\'s businesses. The companies parted ways in April under mounting competition, with OpenTable facing new rivals to its reservation business and Yelp dogged with questions about stalling growth. Both companies are trying to take charge of the entire customer experience, said an analyst. \"If they have to share that customer with someone else, it threatens their long-term viability,\" he said. The companies halted a deal that since 2010 had allowed users to make OpenTable reservations through Yelp, home to a trove of reviews from diners.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFed Raises Key Interest Rate for First Time in Almost a Decade:\\xa0The Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it would raise its benchmark interest rate, a vote of confidence in the American economy. Policy makers have waited a long time for this moment: Since December 2008 the Fed has held the benchmark rate near zero, the centerpiece of its campaign to revive economic growth and reduce unemployment from the recession. Fed officials predicted that they would raise interest rates by about one percentage point a year over the next three years — an indication that they would be taking a slow-and-steady approach to economic expansion. The cost of borrowing is expected to rise, but only slightly, with variable effects on what banks charge for credit cards, home equity lines of credit, adjustable-rate mortgages, auto loans and some student loans. Remember, Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, has said the Fed will move cautiously in raising its benchmark rate. Financial markets were encouraged by the Fed’s announcement. Stocks rose, the dollar gained modestly and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose slightly. The Fed’s announcement came exactly seven years to the day after the central bank cut its benchmark rate nearly to zero.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook Messenger Lets You Book an Uber:\\xa0\\xa0The feature will be made available in the U.S. to start. Taking another page from its counterparts in Asia, Facebook will add a feature for booking a ride through its messaging application. Users of Facebook Messenger in the U.S. will be able to summon an Uber car with a few taps starting on Wednesday. The new feature for Messenger, which has more than 700 million users globally, will allow users to tap on a street address in a message and summon a ride. After booking, the app will let Uber customers easily share their estimated arrival times or coordinate splitting the fare with friends through Messenger. The feature is expected to be made available in other countries outside the U.S. later. One place Facebook probably won\\'t introduce the Uber button any time soon is in China, where the social network is blocked. The Chinese have had a similar feature in Tencent\\'s WeChat, the dominant messaging platform in the country. That version works with Didi Kuaidi, however, a Tencent-backed ride-hailing service that is Uber\\'s chief competitor there. Tencent has blocked Uber from using WeChat to recruit drivers or promote the company in China, says Uber.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon Leads $23M Investment In India-Based Home Services Startup Housejoy:\\xa0Amazon has led a $23 million investment in India-based Housejoy, a startup that — as the name not-so-subtly suggests — is much like Homejoy, the home services on-demand company that closed its doors this summer. The U.S. e-commerce giant was joined in the Series A round by existing investor Matrix Partners, and new backers Vertex Ventures, Qualcomm and Ru-Net Technology Partners. Unlike U.S.-based Homejoy — which had raised nearly $40 million and was the most visible player in an emerging category — Housejoy offers more than just home cleaning services. It caters to plumbing, electrical/appliance repairs, beauty, fitness, laundry and pest control and more. The startup is less than a year old, it previously raised $4 million, and is currently available in 11 cities across India. With this new funding, CEO Saran Chatterjee told TechCrunch that it plans to expand to cover 25 cities by the end of next year. The involvement of Amazon, which previously invested in India-based deals with financial comparison service BankBazaar and gift card startup QwikCilver, is interesting. Its founder Jeff Bezos hasn’t been shy in admitting that the company is very much focused on growing in India, where it launched two years ago and is rivaled by two home-grown unicorns: SoftBank-backed Flipkart and Alibaba-backed Snapdeal. Last year, Amazon invested $2 billion in its India business and results seem to be going its way after it recently claimed to have beaten its well-backed rivals on monthly traffic for the first time. Chatterjee stressed in an interview that Amazon hasn’t discussed acquiring Housejoy, and that its involvement in the round could unlock a lucrative partnership for the startup. Beyond its expansion, Housejoy plans to use the money to ramp its quality assurance protocols which evaluate and assess the ‘service providers’ who work for the company. In that way, it’s very much like Uber — a marketplace through which independent workers can find jobs. With some customers experiencing issues with the service — including one India-based writer at Tech In Asia — Chatterjee admits that it needs to raise its reliability from (probably) a seven out of ten score, to nine or ten. The company is also planning to spend a portion of its funding on strategic acquisitions. Chatterjee said that around 10 percent of the round — so roughly $2 million — could go towards buying up companies or acquihiring teams that “give us a position of strength in a city or category, or [add to the] team and talent.”\\n\\n\\nOracle profit forecast fails to impress; shares fall.\\xa0Oracle Corp on Wednesday delivered a third-quarter profit forecast that did not quite meet analysts\\' expectations, and the company\\'s shares fell about 1 percent in extended trading. Oracle forecast third-quarter profit of about 63-66 cents per share, with revenue flat or up 3 percent which translates to $9.33 billion-$9.61 billion. The company\\'s shift from licensing software to cloud-based subscriptions has squeezed its margins. Oracle, like other established technology companies, has been moving its business to the cloud-based model, essentially providing services remotely via data centers rather than selling installed software. Up to Wednesday\\'s close, Oracle\\'s stock had fallen 13.5 percent this year.\\n\\n\\nIn a Self-Serve World, Start-Ups Find Value in Human Helpers:\\xa0The Internet took off as a way to book travel because the human intermediaries were always a bit suspect — their expertise questionable, their methods opaque and their allegiances unclear. And at first, the machines seemed to improve everything. For uncomplicated trips, booking online is now much easier than in the past. Because we’ve replaced agents with computers whose sole purpose is to ferret out the best deal, and for lots of other reasons, airfares have plummeted over the last three decades. Yet as you suffer through another holiday travel season, you might pause to consider how much we’ve really gained — and lost — in ditching human agents for machines. And you might welcome an emerging trend on the Internet: start-ups that are trying to put human agents, whether in travel, home services or shopping, back at the center of how we make decisions. “A lot of companies pushed hard on the idea that technology will solve every problem, and that we shouldn’t use humans,” said Paul English, the co-founder of a new online company called Lola Travel. “We think humans add value, so we’re trying to design technology to facilitate the human-to-human connection.” Lola, which is currently open only in a limited prerelease version, has an unusual interface: When you’re looking to book a trip, you just send a text. Your request can be vague — “Hey, my family is thinking about going to Europe next summer” — because on the other end sits a human. The agent knows your general travel preferences and has access to many of the same tools you’d use to book a trip. But the agent also has something extra — experience and data to help make decisions about the kind of trip you should take.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

Attempt to vary the where in wearables, like Google Glass — the no-longer-in-production spectacles so nerdy only cast members from The Big Bang Theory dared to wear them out in public — have already been cast to the junk heap of history. When a gadget seemingly straight from the future couldn’t cut it, it speaks to the fact that we need our wearables to be stylish and practical.\\xa0In the future wearables will most likely be simply known as just clothes. Companies like Intel are already working to make what seems like a far-off vision a reality. \"The most exciting thing is going to be when the technology [becomes] so small and tiny that we\\'ll be able to embed it into anything and everything,\" Aysegul Ildeniz, the vice president of Intel’s New Devices, tells us. \"So we’re talking about potentially, one day, fabrics or the stuff we wear on us will be smart... we could put it in a hat, or shoe, or pants.\"\\n\\n\\nHudson’s Bay Is Said to Consider Buying Gilt Groupe for $250 Million:\\xa0Gilt Groupe, a onetime darling of online fashion sales, is nearing a deal to sell itself — albeit at a steep discount to its once lofty valuation.\\xa0The Hudson’s Bay Company, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, is in advanced talks to buy the start-up for about $250 million, a person briefed on the matter said on Monday. That is down significantly from the $1 billion valuation that Gilt fetched more than three years ago.\\xa0A deal could be announced early next year, though people briefed on the talks cautioned that negotiations were still underway and could still fall apart. Gilt is\\xa0also speaking with a handful of other potential buyers in addition to Hudson’s Bay, according to another person briefed on the talks. Should the two sides reach an agreement, it would cap a long and volatile ride for Gilt, which shook up the fashion industry when it opened for business eight years ago. The company focused on so-called flash sales, in which consumers have a limited amount of time to buy clothes, accessories and furniture sold by the site.\\xa0The business model was so popular that Gilt raised $138 million from investors like SoftBank of Japan and Goldman Sachs in 2011, even as it remained unprofitable. And the online retailer was regarded as a star in New York City’s start-up community.\\xa0The company’s early success bolstered the reputations of its founders, including Alexis Maybank, Alexandra Wilkis Wilson and Kevin P. Ryan, the former chief executive of the online ad company DoubleClick, who also served as chief executive of Gilt.\\xa0But flash sale sites, like Gilt, have lost their luster as consumers become increasingly desensitized to deals, analysts say.\\n\\n\\nIn Virtual Reality Headsets, Investors Glimpse the Future:\\xa0Magic Leap, a secretive company making wearable technology for mixing digital imagery with the real world, is seeking to raise $827 million. Jaunt, maker of a 3-D camera for filming virtual reality video, has nabbed a total of $100 million, including $65 million in September. And 8i, which makes technology that lets people interact with video of humans as though they were in the same room, has raised nearly $15 million.\\xa0None of these start-ups is a household name. Few members of the public have had an opportunity to interact with — much less buy — the virtual and augmented reality technology that these companies are developing.Yet investors and entrepreneurs believe that headsets made to immerse people in digital worlds are the next giant moneymakers in technology, setting off an investor frenzy rarely seen since the early days of the web and mobile markets. Virtual reality start-ups are multiplying, venture capital is pouring into them and the believers are expressing blue-sky thinking about how the new products could reshape entertainment, communications and work.\\n\\n\\nDiagnosing Yahoo’s Ills: Ugly Math in Marissa Mayer’s Reign:\\xa0Let’s do some basic math about Yahoosince Marissa Mayer took the helm over three years ago.\\xa0She paid about $3 billion for acquisitions of companies you’ve mostly never heard of, like Aviate, Polyvore and Distill (and one company you may have heard of, Tumblr). She spent $9.4 billion on stock buybacks; over the last two years, when the stock was trading higher, the buybacks have been a $2.5 billion money-losing trade. About $365 million of compensation went to Ms. Mayer herself, assuming she stays for an additional year and a half. And $109 million to an executive she hired to be her chief operating officer, who was then summarily fired 15 months later. An estimated $450 million on free food for the staff. And, depending on whom you believe, double-digit millions of dollars on parties and events, including a “Great Gatsby”-themed holiday party several weeks ago that was held with no apparent irony. Many of those figures come from a devastating new presentation sent to Yahoo’s board over the weekend by Eric Jackson, who runs a small hedge fund called SpringOwl Asset Management and who has long railed about the company’s missteps.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon overtakes Flipkart as most visited Indian e-com site: comScore:\\xa0E-commerce giant Amazon Inc said on Monday it has become the most visited e-commerce site in India beating local rival Flipkart in the month of October citing comScore data.

His Mathematica program for symbolic mathematical computation and its programming language, Wolfram Language, are favorites of the intelligentsia of the quant world in universities and corporations. Wolfram Alpha, his question-answer technology, is available on its own website and serves up many of the answers for Apple’s voice-controlled digital assistant, Siri. His approach to this artificial-intelligence challenge was both innovative and idiosyncratic, and characteristic of Mr. Wolfram, who earned his Ph.D. in particle physics from the California Institute of Technology when he was 20 and soon after received a MacArthur “genius” award. Wolfram Alpha, he explains, is a “knowledge-based system,” which computes answers from its storehouse of knowledge rather than today’s prevailing technique of determining statistical probabilities from poring through vast amounts of data. His Wolfram Language is similarly a tool for what he calls “knowledge-based programming.” And Mr. Wolfram wants to make his technology and his software philosophy available to far more people, including newcomers to computing, like students and children. So he has decided to make a version of the Wolfram Language and development tools available as a free cloud service. To help, he also has published a book, “An Elementary Introduction to the Wolfram Language,” which is free to read online. Wolfram Language is already one of the programming languages distributed with the Raspberry Pi, a credit card-size computer that can be plugged into a computer monitor or television and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. The most popular model is $35. The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a British charity founded in 2009 to further basic education in computing to young people of all income levels. Its nonprofit company, Raspberry Pi Trading, sells the inexpensive, general-purpose computers.\\n\\n\\nHave iPhone Sales Finally Peaked? Analysts Predict a Slump Ahead:\\xa0Is Apple’s iPhone finally reaching its peak? In the past few weeks, a slew of analysts have predicted that sales of Apple’s best-selling product may slump in 2016, based in part on supply chain issues and partly on weaker demand, especially from saturated developed markets. Apple’s growth is increasingly dependent on demand for iPhones, while iPad tablet sales decline and adoption of the Apple Watch remains modest. Morgan Stanley lowered its forecast for iPhone unit sales and now estimates a drop of 6 percent in fiscal 2016, according to a Dec. 13 note. The decline is due to higher prices in international markets, excluding China, and maturing smartphone penetration in developed countries. China is the only market with year-over-year iPhone demand growth in the December quarter, according to the report.\\n\\n\\nWhy Glass Is Critical to the Future of Tech:\\xa0One material has emerged that is probably second only to the processor when it comes to the importance of delivering a great user experience in all types of devices, especially mobile ones. That material is the glass screens on billions of feature and smartphones in the market today. Putting glass screens on a table top and turning it into a huge interactive screen could change the way many people interact with their digital content. Making glass walls that can show off all types of video and content, and applications that can be touched to activate them, is exciting. Imagine a glass screen on your refrigerator, or a glass mirror in the bathroom that delivers a touch-based gateway to all of your digital “stuff,” and you begin to see the role glass will play in a much broader way in the near future.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs Acqui-Hiring Dead? Tech Startups Long for the Days of Yahoo’s Binge Acquisitions:\\xa0Under Marissa Mayer, Yahoo used to be the top company making “acqui-hires,” but such talent acquisitions have fallen out of favor throughout Silicon Valley this year. In 2013 and 2014, Yahoo was the top technology company conducting acqui-hires, an industry term for acquisitions done primarily for the talent, according to research firm CB Insights. Yahoo was tied for third in 2012, Mayer\\'s first year at the company. In 2015, Yahoo has disappeared from the list entirely. When Mayer joined from Google, she was looking for an infusion of technical and entrepreneurial talent to improve the company\\'s mobile and Web services. The fresh blood failed to revive the staid Internet portal, and now Yahoo is considering a spinoff of its core Web business to address investors\\' tax concerns. \"They made acquisitions, and nothing came out of it,\" said Sameet Sinha, an analyst at B. Riley & Co. \"The focus has shifted over the last few quarters to integrate, rather than acquire.\" Sarah Meron, a spokeswoman for Yahoo, declined to comment. The excitement surrounding talent acquisitions has dissipated throughout Silicon Valley, not just at Yahoo. Active acquirers, such as Apple, Facebook, Google, and Twitter, have started to pull back on buying for talent, CB Insights said. U.S. talent acquisitions have declined 48 percent this year from a peak in 2013, the firm\\'s data show. CB Insights compiled the information from company reports, which wouldn\\'t include undisclosed purchases or those not classified as talent acquisitions. Instead of pursuing costly acqui-hires, many companies have returned to old-fashioned recruitment, said Ben Narasin, a general partner at Canvas Ventures. \"All of these top firms need more people, but are you really willing to pay a million-dollar cost of acquisition for a whole bunch of people?\" he said. \"I think acqui-hiring is dead.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2015 Was The Worst Year For Tech IPOs Since 2009:\\xa0With just 28 technology companies entering the U.S. public markets, 2015 was the worst year for IPOs since 2009, according to Dealogic. This compares to 62 last year and 48 the year before, with 131 “unicorns” opting to remain private longer. The performance of the tech IPOs has also been subpar. Half of the tech companies that have gone public this year are trading below their IPO price, including Etsy which fell 41%. And both Box and Square, went public at market caps that were beneath the valuation of their last private rounds. Companies which had strong fundamentals, like Atlassian, were able to hit the ground running. Fitbit is up 56% since its June IPO and GoDaddy, which is on the verge of profitability, has risen 68%. “2016 may see 2 types of companies go public,” said Anand Sanwal, CEO of CB Insights. “One are the good companies with solid fundamentals. The other set of companies are those that get pushed into going public because the private markets close up on them.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdidas’s ‘speedfactory’ hints at the future of shoe manufacturing:\\xa0\\xa0Adidas announced this week that it is setting up what it calls a “speedfactory” in Ansbach, Germany, in an attempt to be at the forefront of manufacturing and offer individualized products that get in customers’ hands quicker. Its goal is to use the latest manufacturing innovations to produce a largely automated process. (From a business perspective, it’s not appealing to shift factories to areas with higher labor costs, unless the operation runs with minimal human labor.) By leveraging recent developments in robotics, Adidas may be able to better serve its customers. In the long run, the model could potentially expand beyond shoes to all goods. For example, after a big sporting event the conversation among sport fans in a given city might center around an athlete’s latest touchdown celebration dance, or a clever quip to reporters. If a company such as Adidas had a factory located near that city, it could rapidly produce and sell related merchandise before the conversation had cooled off. \\xa0The first step for Adidas is to produce 500 pairs of concept shoes in the first half of 2016. Those initial pairs will all be one type of running shoes. Down the line Adidas envisions custom-made shoes that might have a sole designed to fit an individual customer’s foot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba Buys Prominent And Vocal Hong Kong Newspaper For $266M In Bid To Influence Media:\\xa0The Alibaba Group, the Chinese Internet giant, is making an ambitious play to reshape media coverage of its home country, taking aim at what company executives call the “negative” portrayal of China in the Western media. As the backbone of this effort, Alibaba agreed on Friday to buy the media assets of the SCMP Group, including one of Hong Kong’s most influential English language daily newspapers, The South China Morning Post. Alibaba is acquiring an award-winning newspaper that for decades has reported aggressively on subjects that China’s state-run media outlets are forbidden to cover, like political scandals and human-rights cases.Alibaba said the deal was fueled by a desire to improve China’s image and offer an alternative to what it calls the biased lens of Western news outlets. While Alibaba said the Chinese government had no role in its deal to buy the Hong Kong newspaper, the company’s position aligns closely with that of the Communist Party, which has grown increasingly critical of the way Western news organizations cover China. This coverage, the company said, influences how investors and others outside China regard Alibaba. The company said its shares, which are listed in New York, were being affected by all the negative reports about China. For Alibaba, the financial stakes are not significant. Estimated to be worth $266 million, the deal represents a relatively small amount for a company with more than $12 billion in annual revenue. The bigger risk is reputational, as Alibaba leaps into the realm of politics. In owning The South China Morning Post, Alibaba will control a news organization that operates along a border that separates two systems, one in Hong Kong with a relatively free press and another in mainland China with strict censorship controls. As speculation of a deal began in recent weeks, some critics in Hong Kong had already started to worry about whether Alibaba was seeking to tame the paper’s coverage in order to curry favor with the Chinese leadership. The newspaper, which is not subject to China’s strict censorship rules, has long jumped into controversial issues on the mainland like covering the anniversary of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square and last year’s Occupy Central movement in Hong Kong. The newspaper has delved into scandals among China’s elite, including Ling Jihua, who served as an aide to the former Chinese president Hu Jintao.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter Aims to Show Advertising to Much Wider Audience:\\xa0Twitter has long argued that its reach and influence extends far beyond the 320 million people who log into its social media service at least once a month. Tweets are embedded on thousands of other websites and apps, emailed, displayed on television and published in newspapers. Now the company plans to start making money from the vast number of people who are not signed in to the service but may click on a tweet they find through a web search or that is sent to them via email or text — an audience Twitter estimates at more than 500 million people worldwide. In a blog post on Thursday, the company said it has begun showing advertising to some of those casual viewers when they click on the link to a tweet or visit a Twitter user’s profile page. About 60 advertisers are participating initially, with the ads, known as promoted tweets, aimed at people in the United States, Britain, Japan and Australia. But the program, which has been in development for more than a year, is expected to ramp up quickly. These ads, which will be on the desktop web version of Twitter at first, won’t be quite as finely targeted as typical Twitter ads, relying on context, like other pages people have recently browsed, for targeting. Twitter estimates that each of these “logged out” users could be worth $2.50 a year to advertisers, compared with about $4 a year for active users. Wall Street, which has been focused mostly on Twitter’s lack of growth in active users, sees lots of potential in the program, and Twitter’s stock rose almost 7 percent on Thursday.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoPro\\'s First Drone, Due Out in 2016, Will Be Called \\'Karma\\':\\xa0GoPro recently said it will debut its first drone in early 2016, and now the company has announced the brand name—Karma. On Wednesday, the company made the revelation by pushing a one-minute YouTube teaser. The video is a cut-up of the unbranded two-minute clip that GoPro uploaded to the video site on Oct. 28, when it originally disclosed its latest hardware. The longer spot has garnered nearly 4 million views since then. There\\'s not much information about the drone—in terms of what it looks like or how much it will cost—in the video or on its dedicated website. But developing and marketing the product makes a lot of sense since so many GoPro enthusiasts have been attaching the high-def camcorders to drones made by other hardware companies. There are literally thousands of videos from such productions on YouTube. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook to Publish Designs for `Big Sur\\' AI Computer Hardware:\\xa0Facebook’s use of artificial intelligence, which ranges from tools for image recognition to the filtering of the news feeds for its social network, demands special computing infrastructure. The company recently began building custom servers for its artificial intelligence workload and Thursday announced it would release the designs for that powerful hardware to the world -- for free. The company said the plan to open-source the blueprints of the servers -- called “Big Sur” -- would help other companies and researchers benefit from the incessant tweaking of Facebook’s developers. This follows \\xa0Google’s release last month of a software tool for building AI systems named TensorFlow. The servers are built around graphical processing units from Nvidia Corp. GPUs are widely used in artificial intelligence because the chips have far more individual processing cores on them than traditional processors produced by Intel Corp., making them adept at the dumb-but-numerous calculations required by AI software.\\n\\n\\nWal-Mart adds to mobile wallet frenzy with \\'Walmart Pay\\':\\xa0Wal-Mart launched its own mobile payment service Walmart Pay on Thursday, potentially dealing a sharp blow to the ambitions of a mobile wallet the company had been co-developing with a consortium of retailers. The mobile payments space in the U.S. has seen a flurry of new launches and partnerships in the past year but has failed to gain traction as customer and merchant adoption have been sluggish. CurrentC - whose developers included Wal-Mart, Target and Best Buy among others - was likely to prove strong competition to Apple\\'s Apple Pay because it was developed as a single payment solution that could be used at many retailers and integrate their loyalty programs. But years of delay, a data breach and management changes hurt its prospects. An increasingly bigger worry for CurrentC is the end of its exclusive partnership with most of its members, which means they can now accept other mobile payment options at their stores. A survey released by data firm InfoScout found Apple Pay use to be at its lowest rate since the firm started tracking it. Shoppers used it this past Black Friday for only 2.7 percent of eligible transactions.\\n\\n\\nRovio’s CEO Steps Down After Just Over a Year:\\xa0Last August Pekka Rantala took over the role of Rovio CEO from co-founder Mikael Hed, but just over a year later he’s already stepping down. He’s to be replaced by Kati Levoranta, former chief legal officer for the Angry Birds maker. Rantala says that “I feel now the time is right for me to step aside and move on to new challenges.” Despite being in the role for a relatively short period, Rantala presided over a tumultuous time for the game developer. Last October the company laid off 130 employees, and followed that up with 260 more job cuts in August, more than 30 percent of its workforce. The initial, unexpected success of Angry Birds caused the company to expand in many directions, yet it never managed to follow up Angry Birds with another big hit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBig data company Palantir raises $679.8 million:\\xa0Palantir Technologies, the data firm best known for helping the U.S. government track down al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, has raised $679.8 million, according to a filing on Wednesday. The cash injection, which further expands the $500 million the company originally said it was raising in July, shows that despite shifting market conditions for privately held companies investors still hold confidence in the strongest of them, particularly those geared toward enterprises. Palantir is currently valued at $20 billion, making it the richest venture-backed company in the United States after ride service Uber and accommodation service Airbnb. It works closely with the U.S. government, whose steady business provides part of the reason investors like the Palo Alto, California-based company.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAtlassian, the Profitable Aussie Unicorn Going Public Tomorrow:\\xa0Atlassian is Australian management and workplace software maker. It’s set to begin trading on the Nasdaq tomorrow under the ticker symbol TEAM. Atlassian is looking to raise $440 million at a $4.2 billion valuation, up from the $370 million at under $4 billion it was shopping around last week. The bootstrapped Sydney, Australia-based startup has never taken any VC funding, and says it has been profitable for the last 10 years. The service it offers that people are most likely to have heard of is HipChat, an office chat and workflow management service that’s squaring off against Silicon Valley-adored Slack. CNBC has a detailed rundown on what Atlassian’s IPO prospectus says about its business. Atlassian is an outlier to all this. A decade of profitability buys a lot of credibility with investors, and having never taken venture dollars, it doesn’t have to worry about activating a ratchet if something goes wrong tomorrow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWho won, who lost in Square\\'s IPO?\\xa0Square’s recent $2.9 billion IPO is either a huge win for its investors or a sign of very bad days to come, depending on whether you believe the “high-five” tweets from prominent venture capitalists (VCs) or the slew of hand-wringing articles — from sources like NPR, The Verge and the Wall Street Journal — essentially saying it marks the end of free-flowing startup capital.The wildly contradictory responses to Square’s Nov. 19 debut on the New York Stock Exchange, when the payments-processing company’s stock was priced below its previous funding round in the private markets, has left a lot of people in the startup community (and beyond) wondering what’s going on. My take is that the IPO is further evidence that the new rules of the hunt for “unicorns” — startups valued at more than one billion dollars — are creating a small class of “haves” and a much larger class of “have-nots.” The lucky ones are the earliest-stage investors that find tomorrow’s unicorns. The less lucky are often the late-stage investors — generally the providers of the bulk of the capital — and the talent that signs on as these companies grow to fighting strength and scale. I think this is likely to cause a rebalancing of late-stage valuations and an increase in transparency in private markets.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAT&T is out-building Google Fiber:\\xa0Consider this: The number of cities where Google Fiber has actually been switched on can be counted on your fingers, whereas AT&T GigaPower is already up and running in some 20 metropolitan areas. Where many of Google\\'s prospective expansions are still in the discussion phase, AT&T has made concrete — though critics might say \"limited\" — investments in many more markets. In short, AT&T is out-building Google Fiber. That\\'s a sign of a broader shift in the industry. What we\\'re seeing now is Google\\'s early lead in the fiber race being eaten away by AT&T\\'s traditional advantage in building networks. Though Google deserves much of the credit for jump-starting the competition in the first place, not to mention blazing a trail for AT&T in important ways, AT&T is on pace to beat Google to many cities in America. And this is why. AT&T is benefiting tremendously from a chain reaction that Google initially began. By now, it\\'s a familiar story: Google went around to cities and basically got them to compete for Google Fiber, handing out a standardized checklist to municipalities laying out all the things they could do to make themselves more attractive to the search giant. In so doing, Google drew attention to many local regulatory processes that otherwise slow down investments in infrastructure. Now, mayors everywhere are scrambling over each other to attract Google. And that has had knock-on benefits for AT&T. In plain English, when Google gets a good deal, so can AT&T. But getting the rights to dig up streets or string fiber along telephone poles is only part of the equation. Then there\\'s the matter of actually doing it. And it can take a long time — in Google\\'s case, as many as 18 months in Kansas City, according to Hunter Newby, chief executive of the company Allied Fiber. And in Austin, Texas, AT&T says it beat Google to market by roughly two years, even though the two companies announced their projects within days of each other. Google declined to comment. Part of what\\'s going on is that AT&T is leaning on decades of expertise in building networks. Many analysts say that Google aims to invest just enough into fiber to encourage more traditional providers to build out their own networks. Then, when consumers subscribe to the better service and take heavier advantage of Google services, Google\\'s core business benefits. In that respect, Google isn\\'t so much going toe-to-toe with AT&T as nudging it to expand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInvestors hover as e-tailers boost demand for Indian warehouses:\\xa0E-commerce in India is booming: the market is expected to grow to $220 billion in terms of value of goods sold by 2025, up from an expected $11 billion this year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. With more Indian consumers shopping online, the country\\'s $110 billion logistics and warehousing sector is stretched. e-tailers need to move goods around swiftly with minimal damage. They demand fire sprinkler systems, climate control, levelled loading bays and paved roads to warehouses. Simply adding this in can lift rents by up to 20 percent, according to real estate firm JLL. Existing spaces, known as \"godowns\" - low-rise sheds with poor ventilation and only a shutter to ward off heat and dust - are too old and cramped for firms like retail giant Amazon.com and Indian rival Flipkart. Amazon India has leased 20 fulfilment centres - warehouses where it stores goods and packs and sorts orders - in the last 18 months from multiple landlords. Still, it needs bigger, modern spaces closer to customers; the average size it leases today is 200,000 square feet. To satisfy that, supply of modern warehouses in India is set to more than double by 2020 to 200 million square feet, JLL estimates, fuelled by online retailers. They took up over 20 percent of the space added in the first half of 2015. Overseas firms including Dutch pension fund manager APG and U.S. buyout group Warburg Pincus are looking to invest in India\\'s warehouses, hoping to cash in on demand for modern and efficient storage space from booming online retailers. \"We have got enough people running around with bags of money, and not that many assets,\" said Ben Salmon, head of Singapore-based Assetz Property Group that has raised $50 million from Asian investors to buy warehouses in India.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s Come to This: Yahoo’s Future Now Hinges on Taxes (And Not Products):\\xa0\\xa0Yahoo is not going to spin off its 15% stake in e-commerce giant Alibaba, according to sources cited by CNBC. Instead, Yahoo is going to look into selling its core Internet business. Yahoo’s core business includes its web properties, apps, search, media, ad business, etc. Yahoo’s 15% stake in Alibaba is worth around $32 billion, while its core Internet business is worth anywhere between $3.4 billion and $4.1 billion, according to analysts. Internet companies are about a lot of things, but primarily their success hinges on making great and innovative products. And unless the execution of getting those offerings out is just abysmal, this trumps all in Silicon Valley. That was the alleged promise of bringing in Google wunderkind Marissa Mayer as Yahoo CEO more than four years ago. Now the company’s fate seems in the hands of tax attorneys, rather than entrepreneurs, which tells you all you need to know about Yahoo at the end of 2015. Last week, Re/code and others reported that the board of the Internet giant was seriously considering pausing the spinoff of its enormously valuable stake in China’s Alibaba Group. The reason: While Mayer and Yahoo CFO Ken Goldman were assured by their pricey tax advisers at Skadden Arps that the transaction would be tax-free, the Internal Revenue Service would not provide any guarantee of that. No spinoff puts Yahoo into play in a very significant way, even if the board does not say so. And none of it has anything to do with creating great products for consumers, which was the only thing that would have saved Yahoo in the first place. Score one for the accountants.\\n\\n\\nGoogle’s High-End Pixel C Tablet Launches to Tepid Reviews:\\xa0In September, Google surprised us all when it announced its Surface competitor, the 10.2-inch Pixel C Android tablet with its optional Bluetooth keyboard. Unlike its Nexus line of tablets, this is the first time Google has built its own tablet. If you’re willing to pay the price — starting at $499 for the 32GB model plus another $149 for the keyboard — the Pixel C is a very nice, solid tablet that sits atop the current crop of Android tablets. At that price, it directly competes with the iPad Air 2 (though the basic model of the Air only comes with 32GB of storage space). The Pixel C is now available in the Google Play store in a select number of countries. You can now buy it in the U.S., Canada, Germany, Ireland, Austria, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, France, Spain, Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland. If you think this tablet/keyboard combo sounds a little bit like a Microsoft Surface, or maybe even Apple’s iPad Pro with a keyboard, you’re not alone. It’s impossible not to compare the C with them. While Microsoft’s Surface is essentially a fully featured laptop with a detachable keyboard, Google and Apple are opting for a combination of a tablet and mobile operating system with a keyboard. There is a market for the C, but I think it’ll be a small one. The Pixel Chromebooks were meant to show what you can build when you don’t cut corners to keep the price down — the C is meant to showcase what that would look like for a high-end Android productivity tablet. It’s the Android Tablet for the CEO — assuming your CEO uses Android.\\n\\n\\nIn China\\'s O2O tech, today\\'s \\'unicorns\\' risk becoming tomorrow\\'s \\'unicorpses\\':\\xa0The Beijing offices of Shequ001, a start-up delivering supermarket goods booked via smartphone, stand almost deserted. Leaflets lie scattered on the floor. Nearly 400 former employees, of a workforce that in March topped 2,000, have joined a social network clamoring to get their unpaid wages. Zhang, who gave only his family name, is one of fewer than three dozen workers left at a company that last year was worth 2 billion yuan ($312 million). \"We just wanted to build the market, so we burned through our money,\" he said, adding he hasn\\'t seen the firm\\'s CEO since March. In China\\'s hottest tech sector, hundreds of \"online to offline\" (O2O) start-ups like Shequ001, which draw mobile users to local physical stores and services, have failed as skyrocketing valuations deter investors and put the brakes on fresh funding. Many more are expected to fall by the wayside, or be driven into mergers in what executives and investors say is a market bubble. China now boasts 21 \\'unicorns\\' - private start-ups valued at over $1 billion - says CB Insights. But now, those inflated valuations - for companies that rarely make any money - are proving too much for investors and new funding is drying up. O2O has found particular traction in China through a combination of widespread smartphone use, a booming mobile payment sector and cheap migrant labor. Entrepreneurs developing O2O apps - for firms offering anything from ride hailing and food delivery to group discounts at shops, restaurants and cinemas - have had easy access to money from technology giants Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, as well as from venture capitalists, private equity, sovereign wealth funds and state-owned enterprises. Start-ups backed by venture capital raised $9.6 billion in July-September alone, four times the level of a year earlier, according to a KPMG and CB Insights report. \"The whole O2O concept is getting too expensive,\" said Han Weiwen, head of Bain\\'s private equity practice in China. \"The valuation is very, very high. There\\'s no traditional way to look at the valuation ... because they don\\'t have revenue.\" The fierce competition and high spending drives start-ups back to their investors for frequent cash injections, pushing valuations higher. But as the financing roller-coaster has slowed, many start-ups have struggled to afford the subsidized discounts they need to keep users. In O2O, user numbers, whether from inflated demand or not, are a key metric to attracting fresh investment. \"This kind of craziness can\\'t go on forever,\" said Liu Jun, who heads Baidu\\'s efforts in O2O and sits on the board of Uber\\'s China unit. \"Enough is enough.\"\\n\\n\\nApple Executive Seeks a Touch of Chic at Retail Stores:\\xa0Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of retail, got a private demonstration of the fancy wireless speaker, the Phantom, and its sound quality seven weeks ago. On the spot, she said she wanted the space podlike device, which starts at $1,990, to be sold in Apple’s retail stores. This week, the Phantom will appear in 14 Apple stores in the United States, and the company is discussing how widely to roll out the product next year. The device will get the sort of prominent display treatment that is typically reserved in Apple stores for the company’s Beats audio accessories. The move is an indication of how Ms. Ahrendts, who started at Apple last year, is changing the playbook at some of the iPhone maker’s stores this holiday season and the direction she’s going in: ultraluxe. Apple’s stores typically spotlight the company’s devices, with the most expensive audio accessories topping out in the hundreds of dollars. The Phantom is the first high-end non-Apple gadget that Ms. Ahrendts, the former chief executive of the fashion house Burberry, has brought in since she took the job. It buttresses some of her other recent moves to create more of a luxury Apple retail experience, including initiating private try-on appointments for the most expensive Apple watches, reducing the numbers and types of accessories that are sold, and pushing manufacturers to make special packaging for gadgets carried in Apple’s stores. Apple has traditionally sold the most expensive accessories online only, like the $2,700 B&O BeoPlay A9 MKII speaker. “I asked Tim a very simple question: Why do we do it this way?” she said of her boss, Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive. Mr. Cook told her he didn’t know, she said\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlphabet, the company formerly known as Google, revealed a new name for the company’s Life Sciences division: Verily.\\xa0Alphabet made the branding announcement with a video and a company website that went live on Monday. In it, Verily laid out a multidisciplinary approach to health and longevity, describing disease as a “continuum” that will be fought with experts from different fields and divisions working on hardware such as medical devices, software that might use algorithms to look for health patterns, as well as clinical studies like the Baseline Study of health and disease. The new name for the business is part of Google’s transition to a holding company structure under the parent entity dubbed Alphabet. For those keeping track of Alphabet’s soup of operating companies, Verily is the division that was the Life Sciences unit of Google’s X lab. Life Sciences “graduated” from Google X shortly after Google announced the Alphabet structure. Verily means “truth” or “truly” and the name, according to the spokeswoman, is meant to underscore the company’s mission to”reveal a true picture of health and disease.”\\xa0Background: For years, Google has been entering new businesses, but struggling to recreate the success it enjoys in search and advertising. In August, Google announced that it would create a new org structure where its traditional businesses (search, advertising, YouTube, maps) would continue to be called Google, while all other businesses would become separate companies. The parent of all of these companies would be called Alphabet. The idea is that the new businesses would get more room to grow and innovate like startups, while the traditional businesses would get higher stock market valuations because of their incredible profitability and size.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCan’t Put Down Your Device? That’s by Design:\\xa0Digital life keeps us hooked with an infinite entertainment stream as its default setting. Tech companies often set it up that way. There’s Facebook beckoning with its bottomless news feed. There’s Netflix autoplaying the next episode in a TV series 10 seconds after the previous one ends. There’s Tinder encouraging us to keep swiping in search of the next potential paramour. And then there are the constant notices and reminders — a friend liked your photo or tweet; a colleague wants to connect with you on LinkedIn; an Evite awaits your response — which automatically induce feelings of social obligation. You damn yourself to distraction if you respond, and to fear of missing out if you don’t. Tech companies tend to present these feedback loops as consumer conveniences. A new Intel TV ad, for instance, shows a young girl in the back of a car growing sad because the laptop on which she was watching a singalong video suddenly runs out of power. The company’s new battery-preserving processor, though, ultimately saves the day, “so you never have to stop watching.” T-Mobile has just introduced BingeOn, a feature that offers subscribers on certain plans unlimited high-speed access to popular streaming video channels. There’s even an industry term for the experts who continually test and tweak apps and sites to better hook consumers, keep them coming back and persuade them to stay longer: growth hackers.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVerizon Would Explore Yahoo Deal If It Made Sense, CFO Says:\\xa0Verizon would explore a possible acquisition of Yahoo! if a deal made sense, Verizon Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said. Shammo, speaking at an investor conference in New York Monday, said that while it still wasn’t clear what Yahoo’s board has planned for the tech company, Verizon would take a look if it were to be offered up for sale. Yahoo directors met last week to discuss the viability of spinning off its stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and whether to seek a buyer for Yahoo’s Web businesses. Verizon acquired AOL for $4.4 billion earlier this year as part of a push into mobile video advertising. Yahoo owns online sports sites, financial and general news and advertising technology including BrightRoll, which Verizon might find attractive at the right price. Impediments to a sale of Yahoo are the fate of its stake in Alibaba, a Chinese e-commerce giant, and the tax implications of a sale of that unit.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDropbox Shuts Down E-Mail and Photo Apps as It Gets Back to Businesses:\\xa0The cloud storage company is increasing its focus on corporate customers as it tries to develop a sustainable business. Cloud storage provider Dropbox is killing off two applications it introduced to much fanfare, including a photo-sharing app released last year. The San Francisco company has placed more focus recently on creating tools companies are willing to pay for, while these apps were designed with everyday consumers in mind. The photo app, called Carousel, offered to automatically back up photos stored on a phone and display them alongside images already stored in a Dropbox account. The other app, an e-mail and task manager called Mailbox, came through an acquisition Dropbox made in 2013. The company said in a statement that features from each app will make their way into other Dropbox services. After achieving a valuation of $10 billion in a financing round last year, Dropbox is under pressure to increase its revenue and eventually go public or sell itself. Fidelity Investments and BlackRock wrote down the stakes of their Dropbox investments this year. Dropbox has tried to straddle two missions in recent years: to build a product beloved by consumers and to create a service that satisfies businesses\\' unique needs. The former strategy, which includes these apps, has fallen somewhat out of favor since the company brought in Chief Operating Officer Dennis Woodside from Google last year. Both Carousel and Mailbox competed unsuccessfully with much more popular services from Google and Apple. Mailbox will shut down on Feb. 26, 2016, and Carousel on March 31, 2016.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAirbnb Officially Confirms Gargantuan $1.5 Billion Funding Round in SEC Filing:\\xa0\\xa0Home rental service and unofficial sharing economy mascot Airbnb has made its $1.5 billion funding round official in an SEC document today. The Wall Street Journal first reported news of the equity offering back in June, writing that it set the company’s value at more than $25 billion. The round makes Airbnb the third-most valuable privately held tech company in the world, after Uber (worth $62.5 billion) and the Chinese phone maker Xiaomi (valued at around $45 billion). Airbnb’s lead investors in this round were reportedly General Atlantic, Hillhouse Capital Group and Tiger Global Management, which together composed a third of the Airbnb shares sold. Airbnb is raising giant sums like this and putting off an IPO because the startup — like other highly-valued darlings of Silicon Valley — wants to put its resources into emerging markets around the world, especially China. The company is also busy putting out political fires in its more well-saturated markets like San Francisco and New York City, and is in the process of building a (likely expensive) global political organizing operation to protect its revenue streams. Onstage at the Code Conference earlier this year, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky said that he thinks an IPO is still a couple years away.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

Their hack, called the Human Code Project, uses several IBM Watson APIs, including its Natural Language Classifier, to power a search interface for translating JavaScript code terms into plain English. It’s designed much like a language translation interface, so someone who’s trying to understand what a piece of code is doing can search for a particular Javascript word or phrase within that code to see a definition of what a term such as ‘onclick’ might mean in that particular context. The interface returns a percentage breakdown of how confident the system is in its definition for that term. During the hackathon they uploaded a training document to Watson, and created two classifier sets — one for definitions of code terms and one for phrases, explains Roslyn.\\n\\n\\nSome Twitter Users Call Foul as It Switches Moments and Notifications Buttons:\\xa0Twitter moved Moments for Web and Android viewers yesterday to where the Notifications button once was, causing considerable consternation among faithful users. In a nutshell, many in the Twitterati—thanks to muscle memory—are reflexively tapping the Moments button by accident when they want to check their notifications. Numerous tweets accuse the company of tricking users. \\xa0San Francisco-based Twitter has declined comment. But the move raises the question—as a few of the tweets above hint at—about whether or not the social media company is happy with the metrics that Moments has been getting so far. The end of the fourth quarter is near, and newly re-appointed CEO Jack Dorsey would certainly like to tell Wall Street investors during the next earnings call that Moments is drawing a big crowd. Twitter has made Moments a centerpiece development since Dorsey came back to the helm. Additionally, Digiday reported this week that Twitter\\'s ads for Moments, called Promoted Moments, have an asking price of $1 million. So it stands to reason that Twitter needs Moments to scale in order to make such a purchase worth it for brands.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon Buys Thousands of Its Own Truck Trailers as Its Transportation Ambitions Grow:\\xa0Amazon goes to great lengths to get packages into customers’ hands as quickly as possible — even if it means employing drones. Those efforts will now include putting thousands of Amazon-branded trucks on the road. The ever-ambitious online retailer planned to announce on Friday morning that it had purchased “thousands” of trailers — the part of a tractor-trailer that stores the cargo — to make sure it had the shipping capacity to move products on time as its North American business continues its rapid growth. The trailers won’t be used to deliver packages to customer doors. Instead, they’ll be utilized to transport items from one Amazon warehouse, known as a fulfillment center, to another, as well as between fulfillment centers and sort centers, where Amazon organizes orders by zip code to be delivered to local post offices. A spokeswoman stressed that Amazon would continue to rely on existing trucking partners, which own and drive the tractor portion of the vehicles that will tow the Amazon trailers. The announcement comes as Amazon’s North American retail business is growing at its fastest clip in several years. Revenue for this unit grew 35 percent in the third quarter, fueled by product assortment expansion in categories such as apparel and the growth of Amazon’s hugely popular Prime membership program. The trucking announcement marks the latest initiative aimed at taking more control over how quickly the company can get goods into the hands of its customers. While Amazon continues to utilize trucking partners to move goods within its warehouse network, and UPS and FedEx for package delivery to customer doors, it is increasingly unveiling initiatives to take over more of these functions. Former employees say the goal is to someday be able to circumvent UPS or FedEx entirely, in large part so that snafus like the one that caused late deliveries during the 2013 holidays don’t happen again. One guess on why Amazon only wants to own the trailer at this point: If it owned the tractor, it would have to register as a commercial trucking company and incur the insurance costs and liability risks that come with that. By sticking with just the trailer body, Amazon potentially saves money and avoids other potential headaches. That said, some reports suggest Amazon may eventually go all the way and own the trucks, too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSamsung to finally pay Apple $548 million in patent dispute: Samsung fought until the bitter end to avoid paying Apple, but the company now says it will finally hand over the more than $548 million it owes for infringing the patents and designs of its biggest smartphone rival. In papers filed in federal court in San Jose, California on Thursday, Samsung Electronics said it will make the payment by Dec. 14 if Apple sends an invoice on Friday. Asked if it had done so, Apple declined to comment on Friday. The payment comes after a U.S. appeals court last May reduced a $930 million judgment against Samsung by $382 million, stemming from a 2012 verdict for infringing Apple patents and copying the look of the iPhone. Another trial over remaining damages relating to some of Samsung\\'s infringing products in the case is set to go ahead next spring. Even though the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. had authorized damages to Apple in May, Samsung again appealed the final figure to the same court, and was rebuffed twice more. Now agreeing to pay, Samsung told the San Jose court that it expects to be reimbursed if it eventually succeeds in a forthcoming appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court over its liability for copying the patented designs of the surface, bezel and user interface of the iPhone, which accounted for $399 million of the total award.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll the Product Reviews Money Can Buy - Online Odd Job Site Fiverr In Focus Over Fake Reviews\\xa0\\xa0: The holiday online shopping season has begun, and that means reading lots of online product reviews. Some of these reviews are helpful, others are not. And many are fakes — raves or pans from people who have never actually used the product. Where do fake reviews come from? In this column, a close-up look at one notable source. Q. Starting in early November, and over the course of a week, the Facebook business page for the company where I work, Long’s Jewelers, was hit with 200 one-star reviews. Many of the reviews arrived in a matter of minutes, and all were left without comment. They were bogus reviews that were composed by a freelance spammer, who we believe was paid by one of our competitors. Our average customer rating on our Facebook page fell from 4.8 stars to 2.3 stars. We contacted Facebook, which at first refused to help. I wrote a post on a marketing website, asking for the community’s aid, and then released a statement asking for the public’s assistance. My pleas went viral enough to compel Facebook to re-examine the issue, and it has since taken down nearly all of the purchased reviews. Through a bit of sleuthing, I found that the reviews came through a website called Fiverr, where people offer to perform odd jobs for $5 and up. Leaving negative reviews is apparently one of those jobs. Fiverr banished the person who wrote these particular sham reviews, but hundreds of other people are still on the site, offering a similar service. Fiverr, which started in 2010, is based in Israel and hosts thousands of people performing tasks in hundreds of categories. The sellers use pseudonyms, for some reason, and most gigs, as they are called, are perfectly legitimate, even delightful. “I will create a 16-line song about anything,” reads a gig by Tylerbarks. “I will write message in beach sand at sunrise,” reads another by Batykefer1. But the Haggler rummaged around Fiverr and quickly found dozens of people offering to post positive reviews to Facebook, different Google sites, the Apple App Store, iTunes and elsewhere. None said anything about trumped-up negative reviews, but fabricated raves are nearly as bad — or perhaps just as misleading, though perhaps not quite as malicious.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle Ventures Owns Part of Several Unicorns, but the Biggest (and Trickiest) Is Uber:\\xa0The venture firm has $2.4 billion under management and has invested in 300 companies, a number of which have secured billion dollar valuations (a.k.a. unicorn status). According to new figures released on Sunday, the VC shop added 39 new startups in 2015, including significant bets in commerce (Jet.com), biotech (Editas) and agricultural software (Farmer’s Business Network), a new terrain. Most investments during the year, nearly a third, went into life sciences and health companies, followed by consumer and enterprise startups. It is hard to anticipate that any of these investments will be bigger than Uber — in dollars sunk in or payout. In 2013, Kara Swisher reported that Google Ventures spent $250 million for 1.8 million Series C-1 preferred shares in the ride-hailing app startup. At a then $3.5 billion valuation, that put its stake just north of 7 percent. (Google Ventures declined to comment on this or the size of any other investment stakes.) Uber is now reportedly en route to a valuation of $62.5 billion. Its many subsequent rounds since 2013 have likely diluted Google Ventures’ share, although a source familiar with the deal terms says not by much. Even at the low end of analyst estimation, around 2 percent ownership, the Google Ventures share would, at Uber’s current valuation, hit fivefold return. And who knows how Uber will climb before an IPO. Increasingly, however, it’s a sticky situation. As Uber balloons, many of its ambitions — in mobile app integrations, mapping and self-driving cars — are aimed squarely at Google. The startup is partly driven, several sources said, by a concern the search giant could one day clobber it. Google should be worried if it can’t.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber Valuation Put at $62.5 Billion After a New Investment Round - Tiger Global, Investor in Uber\\'s Rivals, Joins In:\\xa0Uber’s fund-raising efforts are showing no signs of slowing down. The company, based in San Francisco, is close to completing the raising of a $2.1 billion round of venture capital, according to people briefed on the company’s plans, the company’s single largest round to date. Once completed, the investment will value the company at $62.5 billion, according to three people briefed on the plans, securing Uber’s place as the world’s most valuable private start-up. Tiger Global Management participated in the newest round, led by its partner Lee Fixel, as did T. Rowe Price, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the terms are still private. Talks of the funding plans were previously reported by The New York Times in October. On Thursday, Bloomberg News reported the $62.5 billion valuation. Competition is intensifying in the global ride-hailing market, as rivals like Lyft, Didi Kuaidi and other companies raise billions of dollars in to expand as quickly as possible. Lyft, another ride-hailing start-up, is in talks to raise a further $500 million in funding, according to four people briefed on the round, which could value the company at roughly $4 billion. Didi Kuaidi, to date, has raised more than $4 billion in private investment. The participation of Tiger Global, however, is particularly interesting. Tiger Global is an investor in Ola and GrabTaxi, two of Uber’s largest competitors in India and Southeast Asia. It is perhaps the first time a major institutional investor participated in the rounds of both Uber and its major competitors. And on Thursday, Ola and GrabTaxi announced a strategic partnership with Lyft, which is also based in San Francisco and is Uber’s major competitor in the United States.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy would anyone want to buy Yahoo?\\xa0Now, that question may be the key to understanding the parlor game of rumor and conjecture currently swirling around the company. Depending on which speculating analyst you talk to, Verizon, Microsoft, Time Inc., Comcast, AT&T, and even IAC — the company that owns Tinder, OkCupid and Match.com — could all jump in as potential buyers.To be specific, what we\\'re talking about is a possible sale of Yahoo\\'s \"core business,\" but even that term belies the dizzying range of things that Yahoo actually does. Is it a search company? A media company? An advertising company?In truth, it is all of those things, which is one reason we\\'ve seen so many names come out of the corporate woodwork. But it turns out there\\'s one metric that makes Yahoo really attractive here: The number of eyeballs that Yahoo commands on a monthly basis.This might seem obvious in an era where clickbait and traffic seem to rule with an iron grip. But if you take Yahoo apart piece by piece, you start to understand why snapping up the company would benefit some firms more than others.Take Microsoft, for instance. It actually tried to buy Yahoo before, in 2008.Microsoft was worried about Google dominating a new market, search. Microsoft tried to build its own competitor, Bing (then known as Windows Live Search), but it didn\\'t take off with users. So Microsoft figured it would buy the No. 2 player, Yahoo, and combine its search and search ad business with Microsoft\\'s.Fast-forward to today, and Bing is no longer lagging behind Yahoo. In fact, what you have is a market where Bing actually covers more than 20 percent of search, compared to Yahoo\\'s 13 percent. Both have been helped, no doubt, by a joint partnership on search.Combining the two might get Microsoft a bit closer to Google (which commands 64 percent of the market), but it still wouldn\\'t be within striking distance. And Microsoft would also be inheriting all of Yahoo\\'s other Internet businesses, potentially slowing the company down as it tries to execute a shift toward offering more cloud services, especially for corporate clients.But let\\'s shift to some of the other names that have been floated. Three are providers of fixed or mobile Internet — four, if you count Softbank, the Japanese parent company of Sprint. That isn\\'t a coincidence; Internet providers increasingly view original online content as the way to turn their networks into cash cows. Carrying data over simple pipes is no longer as lucrative as before.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLyft Joins With Asian Rivals to Compete With Uber:\\xa0The anti-Uber global alliance of ride-hailing companies has now officially taken shape. On Thursday, Lyft, a ride-hailing start-up based in the United States, announced a coalition with GrabTaxi, Ola and Didi Kuaidi, three of the largest ride-hailing companies in Asia. Under a partnership, the companies can operate in one another’s home countries, forging new pathways for each in markets they have yet to tap into. Many of Uber’s competitors are far smaller and operate in just one or two markets. Lyft, which is currently seeking $500 million in funding at a valuation of $4 billion, operates in more than 60 cities in the United States, for instance. By banding together, the companies aim to achieve more scale and more service adoption in relatively short amounts of time. Partnerships are less expensive than having to spend to establish operations in multiple markets. The companies declined to reveal financial details of their partnership. The alliance has been forming over the last few months. In September, Lyft teamed with Didi, the Chinese ride-hailing behemoth, to provide service to Chinese Didi Kuaidi app users who enter the United States. The move also lets Lyft users find rides in China using the Lyft app; the requests are fulfilled by Didi Kuaidi drivers. Ola is a ride-hailing company in India, and GrabTaxi operates in Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia. Under the partnership, Lyft users traveling to India will be able to open the Lyft app there and have local rides supplied by Ola. In Southeast Asian countries, Lyft will have a similar arrangement with GrabTaxi.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStartup Founders Sound Just as Pessimistic About a Bubble as Tech Journalists:\\xa0There has been a lot of kvetching of late about whether or not we’re in the middle of another tech bubble, and most of the pontificating has come from venture capitalists and tech media. But what do people who launch startups actually think? According to First Round Capital’s new State of Startups Report — a survey of more than 500 founders of VC-backed companies — founders are also largely convinced we’re in a tech bubble of some sort. First Round’s findings indicate that startup leaders are having a harder time raising money and that they think it’s only going to get tougher. The report also says they believe bitcoin is one really overhyped technology, whereas self-driving cars don’t get enough attention. We’ve embedded the report in a slideshow below, but here are some key facts and figures from First Round: 80 percent of founders say they were able to raise what they wanted to in their last rounds, but virtually all of them say that it will be harder to do so in the next year. 73 percent of startup founders believe we are in a bubble, but enterprise startup leaders are twice as likely to say we aren’t (twice as many enterprise tech founders also say they’ll be profitable in the next year). No one has a clue about what the IPO market will look like in 2016: One third says there will be more IPOs, one third says it’ll be about the same and one third says there will be fewer. 90 percent of founders expect to see more tech mergers and acquisitions over the next year, which is also what’s generally expected by industry analysts and experts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCrazy Like a Box: Going Public Can Give Start-Ups Outsize Power:\\xa0In early 2014, when the cloud storage company Box filed for an initial public offering, many on Wall Street looked at its numbers and laughed. Box’s revenues were soaring, but its losses were growing nearly as quickly. It was pouring vast sums into sales and marketing, it had less than a year of cash remaining, and executives did not anticipate making a profit for years. When Box eventually went public this January — after raising another round of private funds to delay its I.P.O. — its stock price briefly surged but has since lost about 40 percent of its value. The company reported on Wednesday that in the third fiscal quarter, it again increased sales, and it projected slightly higher sales in 2016 than it had previously expected. Now, with a stock market valuation of about $1.7 billion, Box is technically in league with the “unicorn” private companies valued at more than a billion dollars — but compared with some of those highflying start-ups, it could easily be mistaken for a pony. Dropbox, a cloud storage competitor that remains private, was valued at about $10 billion in its last fund-raising round. To many in Silicon Valley, Box’s inauspicious debut on the stock market, like several other recent tech offerings, serves as a cautionary tale. While floating an I.P.O. was once seen as a rite of passage in Silicon Valley, in the last few years it has become a much bemoaned annoyance to many tech founders. Companies are waiting longer to go public, and thanks to a surge of money from hedge funds and mutual funds looking to get in on the start-up scene, young companies have been given resources to stay private for years on end. Go out to the public markets before you’re bulletproof, the thinking goes, and you’ll get crushed. No one wants to be the next Etsy, Hortonworks or Box, all of which now trade below their I.P.O. price. But what if Box gets the last laugh? Despite the company’s languishing stock price, it’s possible that a few years from now, many in the Valley may come to look back on Box’s I.P.O. as a masterly timed bit of corporate strategy — an initially painful move that ultimately rewarded investors, improved employees’ financial stability, provided executives with independence from unpredictable private investors and pushed the company to adopt a more structured path toward profitability. To understand why, it helps to look at the market for private tech funding, and how it is affected by public valuations. Several unicorns have recently discovered that taking money from mutual funds and other large investors brings surprising public scrutiny. The mutual fund company Fidelity and others must regularly report assessments of their private-company holdings, and lately they’ve calculated that start-ups like Snapchat and Dropbox are worth less than what the funds paid for them. Dropbox’s valuation, in fact, may now be tied directly to Box’s, since large investors look at comparable public companies to help determine the value of their private investments. The same logic applies to employees. If you’re an engineer looking to work at a cloud storage company, you could go to Dropbox, where you’ll receive stock options at a lofty $10 billion valuation that you’ll have a hard time turning into actual money. Or you can go to Box, in which you’ll get shares at a relatively reasonable valuation that can also be traded on the public market.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBallmer Chides Microsoft Over Cloud Revenue Disclosures:\\xa0\\xa0One major Microsoft Corp. investor wasn’t happy with the level of disclosure Wednesday at the company’s annual shareholder meeting: Steve Ballmer. The company should disclose profit margins and sales for its cloud and hardware businesses, Microsoft’s former chief executive officer said. “It’s sort of a key metric -- if they talk about it as key to the company, they should report it,” Ballmer, who is the company’s biggest individual shareholder, told Bloomberg at the software maker’s annual meeting in Bellevue, Washington. Microsoft reports an annualized revenue run rate -- or sales at a certain point in time carried out to a yearly rate -- for its commercial cloud business and has said it is aiming to reach $20 billion on that basis by 2018. Ballmer, who handed the reins to Satya Nadella in 2014, derided the use of run rate as “bulls---.” “They should report the revenue, not the run rate,” he said. Margin -- a measure of profitability -- is important because while gross margins for software are very high, they are far lower for things like hardware and cloud services, Ballmer said. Microsoft also said in April it would end its fiscal year with a commercial cloud gross margin of 44 percent. Though it reports revenue and margin for some of its cloud businesses, it doesn’t provide a total sales number for cloud. Ballmer said he has discussed the issue with the company and that after almost two years out of the CEO job, he can’t even guess what these numbers are. “We enjoy a regular dialogue with Steve, and welcome his input and feedback, as we do from our other investors.” said Chris Suh, Microsoft’s general manager for investor relations. Ballmer also criticized Nadella’s answer to an audience member questioning the lack of key apps, like one for Starbucks, on the company’s Windows Phone. Nadella responded by citing the company’s plan to appeal to Windows developers by allowing them to write universal applications that work on computers, phones and tablets, targeting a larger array of devices than just Microsoft’s handsets that have just a single-digit share of the mobile market. “That won’t work,” Ballmer commented as Nadella spoke. Instead, the company needs to enable Windows Phones “to run Android apps,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber launches taxi-hailing button for third-party apps:\\xa0\\xa0Online taxi-hailing service Uber [UBER.UL] said it would allow third-party app developers to add a \\'Ride Request\\' button within their apps for free. Developers would need to register their apps on Uber\\'s website to get access to the code to add the button, which users can tap to request a ride. To entice developers to use the feature, Uber said it would pay $5 for every new U.S.-based customer that uses the button from the developer\\'s app. Earlier this year, Uber had partnered with Zomato, an India-based restaurant finder, to add a \"Ride there with Uber\" button on the restaurant page. Last year, Google Maps also integrated Uber within its app to allow users to book a ride.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYahoo shares spike 6% on reports board to weigh selling core business, Marissa Mayer\\'s future role: WSJ. The board of Web giant Yahoo is set to discuss the company\\'s future, and that of high-profile Chief Executive Marissa Mayer, when it meets this week, The Wall Street Journal reported late on Tuesday. People familiar with the matter told the newspaper the board was expected to discuss during meetings from Wednesday through Friday whether to proceed with a plan to spin off more than $30 billion in shares of Alibaba or find a buyer for its core business of web properties, or both. Yahoo\\'s core business, which includes popular services like Yahoo Mail and its news and sports sites, could attract private equity firms, media and telecom companies or firms like Softbank \\xa0analysts have said in the past. The news comes as Mayer faces growing pressure over the company\\'s performance. Mayer came to Yahoo after a long stint at Google. The company\\'s shares were up more than 6 percent in extended trading.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nForget China — Google Has to Fight Off Alibaba on Mobile in India:\\xa0Should Google return some services in mainland China, as many expect it to do soon, it will have to go head to head with China’s Internet giants. In the meantime, Google is squaring off against one of them, Alibaba, in India, Google’s largest growth market. The Information published a solid look at mobile habits across India, courtesy of data from mobile startup Quettra. Some of the figures aren’t surprising. Facebook dominates: Indians love the social site and really love Facebook’s WhatsApp — it has 55 million users monthly hours spent, blowing away other messaging apps. Google, though, has a solid lead in utilities and video apps, thanks to YouTube. A potentially troubling sign for the search giant is the race on mobile browsers. The UC browser, which Alibaba acquired last year, is beating Google’s Chrome in India, with over five million more monthly hours of use. Alibaba’s stripped-down browser takes fourth place. Android dominates India. But Google is still concerned with getting the millions there coming online with smartphones to take their first steps on Google’s service, particularly since Facebook is making a similar push. A mobile browser is, for now, one key thing Google has that its U.S. rival does not. But getting mobile users to use services isn’t the hard problem in India. It’s covering their data costs, which are often prohibitively high. Hence Google’s recent push on building lighter, even offline versions of its products. On Monday, Google unveiled an update to the data-saving mode for mobile Chrome that will roll out first in Indonesia and India.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZuckerberg Vows to Daughter He’ll Donate 99% of His Facebook Shares: Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, announced on Tuesday that he and his wife would give 99 percent of their Facebook shares “during our lives” — holdings currently worth more than $45 billion — to charitable purposes. The pledge was made in an open letter to their newborn daughter, Max, who was born about a week ago. Mr. Zuckerberg and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, said they were forming a new organization, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, to manage the money, through an unusual limited liability corporate structure. “Our initial areas of focus will be personalized learning, curing disease, connecting people and building strong communities,” they wrote. Mr. Zuckerberg’s charitable plans are the latest indication of a growing interest in philanthropy among Silicon Valley’s young billionaires, who unlike previous generations of business tycoons, appear eager to spread their wealth while they are still young. Mr. Zuckerberg is 31, and Dr. Chan is 30. Yet they are entering largely uncharted waters with a charity effort of such scale. They have not yet detailed how the money will be spent and the pace in which the money will be given out indicates they plan to take their time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon gadget sales more than triple over Thanksgiving weekend:\\xa0Amazon.com Inc said sales of its electronic gadgets more than tripled over the Thanksgiving weekend from last year, with the Fire tablet the top-selling product. Sales of the 7-inch tablet more than tripled, while the Fire TV set-top box sold six times more than last year, the company said, without providing the number of units sold.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHoliday Shopping Is Chilly for ‘Buy’ Buttons at Twitter, Facebook and Pinterest:\\xa0More than a year after Twitter and Facebook began placing Buy buttons on their social networks, their e-commerce initiatives still appear to be relegated to experimental side projects. And at Pinterest, the tech platform that many believe is most conducive to e-commerce, one of its mainstream launch partners is seeing fewer than 10 purchases a day via so-called Buyable Pins. The lack of aggressiveness on the part of Facebook and Twitter, and tepid early results at Pinterest, highlight the myriad challenges all three platforms face in transforming their immense user bases into shoppers. The sluggishness of the combined efforts also serves as a warning to other industry players betting big on the idea of social commerce that it’s still unclear if consumers will make purchases in big numbers on platforms that aren’t mainly retail destinations. Spokespeople for the three companies declined to disclose sales numbers for these initiatives. While each platform had its own reasons for pursuing e-commerce initiatives, the central idea was that they thought there was an opportunity to make it easier for their users to buy a product when they discover it on the platform. In theory, the usefulnesses of such a feature would be the biggest on mobile phones, where clicking through to make a purchase on another site can make purchases less likely because of uneven mobile webpage experiences. Facebook was the first to take a crack. Sixteen months after Facebook first began testing Buy buttons on ads and regular posts to let people purchase products they discover on Facebook without leaving Facebook, the initiative is still being dubbed a beta test, restricted solely to online merchants who work with e-commerce software provider Shopify. The company has also recently added purchase capabilities to some Facebook business pages and to a dedicated shopping section of Facebook, but these features, too, are being characterized as “tests” that aren’t available to all Facebook users in the U.S. At Twitter, it’s still unclear how big of a priority e-commerce will be going forward under the leadership of new CEO Jack Dorsey. The company began placing Buy buttons in tweets in September of 2014, and struck partnerships in October of this year with software partners such as Bigcommerce and Stripe to get more merchants on board. Best Buy, for example, will soon join the program — just not in time for the just-passed Black Friday weekend. But regular Twitter users can still go weeks without seeing any tweets enabled with e-commerce; most Re/code colleagues I polled, who are absolute Twitter power users, said they never come across them at all. Then there’s Pinterest, the massive tech platform that retailers were most excited about for its e-commerce potential. The company began inserting Buyable Pins into its iPhone app in late June, and just added the feature to its Android app in early November. The company says more than 10,000 merchants have joined the program, including big retailers and brands like Macy’s, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Cole Haan and Tory Burch, but at least one of these big partners is seeing fewer than 10 purchases a day on Pinterest, according to a person with direct knowledge of the sales figures. This source and another also said that Pinterest insiders have privately admitted to being disappointed with early sales numbers.\\n\\n\\nAppDynamics Raises $158M; Now Valued At $1.9 Billion:\\xa0Last month, based on an SEC filing, we told you that seven-year-old, San Francisco-based AppDynamics had raised a fresh $83.4 million in funding as part of a round that was targeting up to $150 million. Turns out the company met that target and then some. CEO David Wadhwani — who joined the firm in September after spending more than a decade as an executive at Adobe, including as its digital chief — says the company has just closed on $158 million in a round led by General Catalyst and Altimeter Capital. Other participants in the round include Adage Capital, Industry Ventures, Goldman Sachs, and Cross Creek Advisors, as well as earlier backers Institutional Venture Partners, Greylock Partners and Lightspeed Venture Partners. AppDynamics makes software to monitor the performance of business applications, competing with some traditional firms like IBM, as well as younger outfits like New Relic, which went public last December and has seen relatively steady stock performance since. (New Relic, which raised $214 million in venture funding, has a current market cap of $1.8 billion.) AppDynamics had previously raised roughly $206 million in debt and equity, including a $120 million round — $70 million equity and $50 million of debt — that closed in July of last year. At the time of the funding announcement, the company told VentureBeat that the money represented “pre-IPO growth financing.” Asked today what this new round means, Wadhwani said he “won’t speculate on the exact timing” of an IPO but added, “I was brought in to take this company public, and that’s what I intend to do.” The new funding, he said, “represents freedom. We can [execute on our plans for the company] on this money and effectively choose when we want to go public.” Wadhwani declined to discuss the company’s post-money valuation, but a source close to the company pegs it at $1.9 billion.\\n\\n\\nIn a Global Market for Hacking Talent, Argentines Stand Out:\\xa0Want to learn how to break into the computerized heart of a medical device or an electronic voting machine? Maybe a smartphone or even a car? Thanks to the legacy of military rule and a culture of breaking rules of all sorts, Argentina has become one of the best places on earth to find people who could show you how. As Silicon Valley’s talent war has gone global, particularly for those skilled at breaking into things, this Latin American nation has become a rich recruiting ground for corporations and foreign governments. Companies need hackers to help defend against online criminals and state-sponsored spies. And as the world’s critical infrastructure moves online and the threat of war moves into cyberspace, governments are desperate to acquire hackers’ tools. Within Latin America, Brazil has become known in recent years as the world leader in Internet banking fraud. But Argentina’s hackers have a reputation for creativity. In particular, they are known for their ability to find so-called zero-day flaws, which are unpatched holes in widely used technology that can be used to spy on or even destroy adversaries’ computer networks. Technology companies like Apple, Facebook and Google have encrypted their products and services so that in many cases the only way to monitor a target’s communications is to hack directly into its device. As a result, there is a new urgency among governments in acquiring zero-day exploits. A mix of executives from around the world, government officials, contractors and — or so it was rumored — spies gathered here in October in an industrial building converted into a cultural center to watch hacking done the Argentine way at the 11th annual EkoParty, the largest hacking conference in Latin America. Long before foreign companies came calling, hacking things was a life skill in Argentina, a way to get by through decades of repressive military rule and a volatile economy. Argentines have a saying, “atado con alambre,” which translates roughly as “held together with wire,” to describe the inventive nature of so many here who learned to do much with little. The country still has one foot in the tech industry’s past because of stringent import rules. Amazon will not ship to your door here. BlackBerry has more market share here than Apple. A new iPhone costs $2,000 or more on MercadoLibre, an online auction site, but many iPhone owners said they had been able to persuade a friend traveling from abroad to sneak one through customs. To get their hands on the latest, greatest devices, Argentines often have to think like a hacker — or even become one. “You make do without resources, without high-end technology, with poor Wi-Fi connections,” said Sergio Berensztein, an Argentine political analyst. “We improvise creative solutions, for lack of other options, and many have applied these same procedures to the technical industry.”\\n\\n\\nFAA Permit for Drone Flight School May Help Amazon, Google Speed Up Delivery Plans: The Federal Aviation Administration is plotting how to regulate drones. Tech companies with plans for drones — Amazon, Google, DJI, GoPro and a bevy of others looking to tap a potential multi-billion dollar market — are itching for the FAA to get on with it already. Last week, the agency made a small legal maneuver that advocates hope indicates more leniency to come on the commercial applications of drones. The FAA authorized the Kansas State University Polytechnic campus to train students and outside companies on flying unmanned aircraft. This type of authorization, called a Section 333 exemption, is common; construction sites, news outlets and disaster relief groups have received them. Amazon scored one in April. The notable difference here is in how close the FAA lets drones get to people. Even with flight authorization, drones must stay 500 feet from people, unless the craft meet some stringent safety and logistics requirements. The only exception had been on closed film and TV sets, which deploy drones for movie magic. But the FAA lifted the 500-foot restriction for the Kansas school, even though it didn’t ask for the specific closed-set exemption.\\n\\n\\nTarget and PayPal Sites Report Problems on Cyber Monday:\\xa0Cyber Monday, the online version of Black Friday, is not immune to traffic jams of shoppers rushing to take advantage of post-Thanksgiving sales. Some of the most popular websites experienced an overload on Monday, similar to a crowd pushing its way into an already packed brick-and-mortar store. Shoppers were for a period of time unable to gain access to the site of Target, the discount chain,and PayPal, the online payments processing service. Both are now back online after an onslaught that reflects the shifting trends in the way consumers are looking for shopping bargains. Foot Locker, Groupon and Victoria’s Secret also experienced brief outages or slowdowns Monday afternoon, according to Catchpoint Systems, a web monitoring firm. In a statement on Monday, Target said it was experiencing its biggest online volumes ever in response to a 15 percent online discount that it had announced previously. Visitors to the site early Monday got a message saying: “Please hold tight. So sorry, but high traffic’s causing delays. If you wouldn’t mind holding, we’ll refresh automatically & get things going ASAP.” According to a statement from Target, the company said it placed online shoppers in a queue in order to manage the volume of users, but it then allowed them to keep trying to gain access by refreshing their browser. A heat map on downdetector.com showed most of the problems with PayPal were reported in North America and Europe. Problems started around 8:30 a.m. Eastern time. PayPal said in an emailed statement that the “brief, intermittent interruption” in service was resolved. It did not provide a reason. The holiday buying frenzy has evolved over the years as more stores offer sales before and sometimes on Thanksgiving Day. It has also shifted away from physical stores as Americans have increasingly turned to online shopping. For many people, Monday was their first day back at work after the long Thanksgiving weekend, so some shopping was presumably being done surreptitiously while at work.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThanksgiving Final Results – OmniChannel Strikes Back:\\xa0This morning we are releasing the final results from Thanksgiving 2015. What stands out is the Omnichannel players with stores and online marketplaces (Best Buy, Sears, etc.) did extremely well. \\xa0This indicates that these ‘Brick and Clicks’ retailers were really able to tie their store and online promotions together with great success. This data is date-shifted to compare Thanksgiving this year \\xa0(Nov 26) vs. last year (Nov 27). \\xa0In summary, Thanksgiving 2015 blew the doors off, coming in at 43.4% y/y growth compared to 20.1% last year – more than twice the rate of growth. \\xa0The trick is while we know that Thanksgiving 2015 was very strong, we don’t know if this will continue through the entire Cyber Five and through all of Holiday 15, or if consumers are shopping much earlier than last year and will taper off as we get past Thanksgiving. \\xa0Omnichannel marketplaces led the pack with Google Shopping and Amazon also outperforming. From a device perspective, Smartphones were 58% of traffic compared to last year’s Thanksgiving 35% and a new high water mark for this device type in our data. \\xa0From an order perspective, smartphone came in at 37% which was also more than double last year, although conversion rates continue to lag desktop and tablet considerably. Conclusion: consumers not only increased their Thanksgiving sales, but they utilized their smartphones heavily and favored omnichannel retailers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKobe Bryant Takes NBA Retirement News to Twitter, Not TV.

It links to Players Tribune, a site for athletes from fellow superstar Derek Jeter, which subsequently crashed after the Kobe post. It took about an hour for Twitter to add the news to its Moments tab.

The promotional clip, narrated by television show host Jeremy Clarkson, shows a family receiving in about 30 minutes replacement soccer shoes for the one chewed up by its dog. \"In time, there will be a whole family of Amazon drones. Different designs for different environments,\" Clarkson says. The video shows the box containing the shoes ordered by the family fitting seamlessly into the body of the drone. It then rises vertically, in helicopter style, for nearly 400 feet, according to Clarkson, after which it assumes a horizontal orientation, flying like an airplane. Clarkson said the drone in the clip could fly for 15 miles. It was equipped with what he called \"sense-and-avoid technology\" to sense, then avoid, obstacles in its path. The video shows the drone approaching its targeted landing spot, dropping the package, then taking off again, presumably to return where it came from. The launch of the video appeared to be timed ahead of \"Cyber Monday\", one of the biggest shopping events for electronics retailers. Amazon did not say when it hoped to have the drones in service.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJudge Dismisses Yelp Suit Brought by Shareholders:\\xa0Yelp won the dismissal of a lawsuit by shareholders who claimed they had been fraudulently misled about the authenticity and quality of its reviews, and who accused Yelp of manipulating those reviews to favor paying advertisers. In a Nov. 24 decision, United States District Court Judge Jon S. Tigar in San Francisco said reasonable investors would understand that not all Yelp reviews are real, particularly given the company’s admission that its technology to screen user-generated content is not foolproof. In April, Judge Tigar dismissed an earlier version of the complaint, which sought class-action status. He said the plaintiffs could not sue again because any amendment would be “futile.” Yelp lets users rate restaurants and other businesses on a five-star scale. Positive reviews can bolster sales and negative reviews can harm sales, especially if viewers perceive the reviews as unbiased. Shareholders led by Joseph Curry accused Yelp of inflating its share price by falsely promoting the reliability of its reviews, as part of a calculated strategy to extort businesses into buying ads or making payments in exchange for removing bad or fake reviews. But the judge said only 11 of the complaints accused Yelp of offering to manipulate reviews in exchange for fees, a small number.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia’s Grofers Grabs $120M To Bring Offline Merchants Into The On-Demand World:\\xa0The race for on-demand delivery services in India is on, and today one of the bigger startups in the market has picked up a large cash injection as it goes for pole position. Grofers, an Instacart-style app that links up with local, offline merchants to delivery groceries, medicine, flowers, and other daily items to customers, has raised $120 million led by new investor SoftBank. The Series C round also included existing backers DST’s Apoletto Managers, Tiger Global and Instacart investor Sequoia Capital. Grofers CEO and co-founder Albinder Dhindsa and SoftBank have both directly confirmed the round and investors to TechCrunch. Grofers has been on a fundraising tear to aid its expansion. This is the third round raised by the company this year alone, after earlier rounds of $10 million and $35 million. It brings the total to just under $166 million including an earlier seed round. Japan’s Softbank has been pouring hundreds of millions of dollars of investment into Indian startups like Ola, Snapdeal and more, and as part of this round it will take a seat on Grofers’ board. The Times of India, which first reported the raise, cites sources that say Grofers now has a post-money valuation of over $300 million. Dhindsa, who cofounded the company with Saurabh Kumar, would not comment on the valuation and said he hadn’t even wanted to make this fundraise public. “Very honestly it’s just a distraction for the team,” he told TechCrunch. “We’re in the middle of trying to build a business.” Today, that business is currently live in 26 cities in India, with some 1.6 million downloads of the mobile apps that are used to order its services. While Grofers looks on the surface like another Instacart clone, there is more going on under the hood. The company originally started as a B2B provider of a supply chain platform it built to help larger brands distribute consumables to smaller merchants, and for those smaller merchants who are almost completely offline to better keep track of their stock. “In India, retail is very unorganised, so we see an opportunity in helping small merchants come online,” Dhindsa says. Still, perhaps to tap into a more mass market prospect, it recently pivoted — or expanded may be the more accurate term — to make its business more consumer-facing, by offering those small, offline businesses an additional service: a way of showing their stock to consumers, who can order and have items delivered. Typically, Grofers offers some features to businesses for free, such as its inventory management system. It then takes a cut on other business software and services, as well as on the delivery, which can range at prices to consumers of between $1 for groceries to $0.40 for medicines (not as cheap sounding in India as it may be in the U.S.). Dhindsa says that the funding will be used to continue growing its supply-chain management development, but also to continue building out its last-mile infrastructure. Today, Grofers uses a mix of its own employees and contractors to deliver goods. Perhaps cleverly, it has chosen not to make delivery the cost-and-profit focus of its whole operation. In fact, it’s even considered partnering with others for that aspect of its business.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThanksgiving Online Sales Stats: Growth Higher Than Rest of Year As Importance of Holiday Season Sales Rises:\\xa0Thanksgiving is now in full swing in the U.S., and while many are focused on food and football, some are turning their attention online to kick off their holiday shopping. Adobe, which has tracked 100 million visits to some 4,500 retail sites so far today (including 80% of all online transactions from the top 100 U.S. retailers), says that over $1 billion has been spent so far online, and that the final figure is on track to be $1.7 billion — growth of 22% compared to Thanksgiving a year ago, with Star Wars being one of the big brands driving sales. “Thanksgiving Day online sales continue to trend ahead of expectation as we head into the evening hours, when mobile shopping comes back into the mix,” said Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst, Adobe Digital Index. “We expect the day to come in up 22% YoY at over $1.7 billion, driven by stronger than expected toy sales due to Star Wars items and much higher shopping via email promotions (+25% YoY).” Meanwhile, IBM — which also tracks sales across thousands of websites in the U.S. — is publishing real-time numbers showing how people are buying online. As of 3 PM Pacific time today, the average value per order has been $142.55. As a point of comparison, a year ago, IBM said the average order value was $125.25; and in 2013, it was $132. IBM says that online sales the day before Thanksgiving were up by 35% compared to the same day a year ago, with average value per order up by $9.10. (As comparison, U.S. e-commerce sales overall are only expected to go up by 14% this year compared to last, so 35% is high). Taken together, yesterday’s and today’s numbers indicate not only that more more of us are shopping online, but we are spending more in the process. We’ll have to see how those numbers bear out over the next days and weeks before saying whether this is a sign of people getting in early and dropping off, or whether this is a bellwether for a strong season overall. Overall, the period is projected to bring in between $70 billion $95 billion in e-commerce sales. Yesterday, comScore published some numbers predicting that mobile would account for less than 17% of all sales in November and December ($11.7 billion out of $70 billion); but that it would represent nearly all the growth. IBM’s numbers today so far are actually improving on those projections. It says that just under 28% of all sales are being made on mobile devices. And mobiles are also account for just under half (48%) of all e-commerce traffic — that is, browsing for goods if not buying outright. Adobe, on the other hand, is reporting slightly lower numbers for mobile. It says that $283 million in sales have come mobile devices so far this Thanksgiving, with smartphones accounting for 15% of that and tablets 11%. Adobe says this is a big leap over last year’s 18% but actually lower than the 29% it had expected “but will pick up again during Thanksgiving dinner time.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

Customers were lining up, investors were swooning and the Beijing-based startup closed funding at a $45 billion valuation. That was last year. Now the high-flying smartphone maker is stumbling. Founder Lei Jun’s latest business, one of China’s most exciting startup stories of the past few years, is likely to miss its own goal of selling 80 million smartphones this year, according to two people with knowledge of its production plans. Suppliers also cut their internal targets for Xiaomi in anticipation of the shortfall, they said. Xiaomi’s falter shows the startup’s challenge in trying to maintain momentum after a meteoric ascent past Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. in China. Investors bought into the company’s story of youthful disruption and online sales, yet the subsequent lowering of China’s growth target and the copying of its sales strategy by rivals have neutralized Xiaomi’s first-mover advantage, putting its high price tag in doubt. \"All those expectations of growth aren’t being realized, which now makes that $45 billion valuation unfeasible,\" said Alberto Moel, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein in Hong Kong. \"The argument was that their business is kind of like Apple and they’re growing very fast, but they’re no longer growing so fast and they’re not as good as Apple.\" Domestic shipments of Xiaomi smartphones, including its premium Mi 4 and more economical Redmi series, dropped 8 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, its first-ever decline, according to researcher Canalys. IHS, another research firm, estimates that Xiaomi shipments dropped 3.9 percent, barely maintaining the lead over Huawei Technologies Co. That’s a big change from the bold growth projections used to justify Xiaomi’s tag as one of the world’s most-valuable technology startups. In March of last year, Lei predicted selling 100 million smartphones in 2015. Through the first nine months of this year, Xiaomi shipped about 53 million smartphones. With its optimistic forecast, Xiaomi secured $1.1 billion in December from investors including GIC Pte., All-Stars Investment Ltd. and DST. Xiaomi drew comparisons to Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company that months earlier held the largest initial public offering ever.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlack Friday Deal or Dud? How to Shop Smart This Holiday Season:\\xa0Black Friday, which has traditionally been the moment to flock to stores for steep discounts, and which has evolved to also include major online sales events for retailers like Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart, is not all that it is billed to be. We asked J. D. Levite, the deals editor of the product recommendations website The Wirecutter, for some data on just how beneficial the deals are on Black Friday — and the answer was not encouraging. Year round, Mr. Levite and his team track product prices across the web to unearth discounts on goods of all types, from gadgets to kitchenware. They also look at whether the product is high quality and durable based on their own testing and other reviews, and whether the seller or brand has a reasonable return or warranty policy. By those measures, Mr. Levite said, only about 0.6 percent, or 200 out of the approximately 34,000 deals online, which typically carry the same price tags inside retailers’ physical stores, will be good ones on Black Friday. “There are just more deals on that day than any other day of the year,” he said. “But for the most part, the deals aren’t anything better than what you’d see throughout the rest of the year.” There’s a smarter way to shop than relying on Black Friday. With the plethora of web tools now available, consumers can research online and then use trackers to follow product pricing for drops throughout the year. While it’s a time-consuming effort, the method is more precise for understanding pricing trends, both online and in stores. One useful tracking tool is Camel Camel Camel, which is geared toward users of the online retail behemoth Amazon. Using the Camel Camel Camel website, people can view a product’s price history on Amazon.com and then create alerts to receive an email as soon as the item’s price falls to a certain threshold. Over time, interesting trends emerge. One is that some product prices are raised in October, a few weeks before Black Friday. The prices are reduced again on Black Friday. Camel Camel Camel’s database also shows some items have predictable pricing patterns over the course of a year. A pair of bookshelf speakers made by Pioneer are typically $127, but that tends to drop significantly in August — to $60 in August 2014 and to $88 in August 2015, timed to the back-to-school season. This week, the same pair of speakers was again $127. In other words, there are times of year when different types of products decline in price — and Black Friday isn’t one of them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll In: Why Nikesh Arora Bet $483 Million on SoftBank\\'s Future:\\xa0It began late one night this year when he and Son were talking about people’s tolerance for risk and how it tends to decline over time. Arora took a chance as a kid by leaving India for the U.S. with only $200 in cash, but he had since gone on to a lucrative career. So Son prodded him. “Masa said, ‘How much risk appetite do you have?”’ Arora says. “‘Do you believe you can transform SoftBank into a company two, three, five times its size? Now is the time to take the risk.”’ A week later, Arora came back with a plan to buy 60 billion yen ($483 million at the time) in SoftBank shares, more than any insider purchase by an executive in Japan in at least 12 years, according to Bloomberg data. He would become the company’s second-largest individual shareholder and borrow heavily to do it. Arora says investors don’t yet appreciate what SoftBank is becoming. The company has been battered recently because of struggles at two major holdings, the China e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and the U.S. wireless operator Sprint Corp. SoftBank is still valued at less than the public shares it owns, meaning investors deem its operating businesses practically worthless.Arora professes not to be worried. He says investors will come around once the company makes progress in reviving Sprint, lets Alibaba recover and demonstrates that it’s more than a Japanese telecommunications company with a spotty investment record.“I’m very relaxed,” Arora said. “I’m here for at least the next 10 years.” \\xa0Arora was hired last year after a decade at Google Inc. and promoted to president in June. Since then, he has been quietly building his own operation within SoftBank, an investment arm that will take stakes in technology companies around the world. Though SoftBank put money into startups for decades, including a tumultuous foray during the dot-com bust, the effort had dwindled in recent years to what Son called a “hobby” next to his wireless and broadband businesses. Arora is reviving the venture push and making it much more ambitious. He is hiring a team of 15 to 20 outsiders and plans to put about $3 billion into startups each year. Arora’s recruits, from companies such as Google and LinkedIn Corp., are hand-picked for the expertise they can offer startups in key areas like personnel, product development and acquisitions. He says SoftBank will hold a competitive advantage by operating at a financial strata few can reach. He plans to make five to 10 investments a year of $100 million to $1 billion. The idea is to back startups that have proven products and need to expand -- the rapid phase of growth Arora helped manage at Google.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMorgan Stanley Said Struggling to Sell EBay Enterprise Deal Loan:\\xa0Morgan Stanley is struggling to unload $640 million of loans backing the private-equity buyout of EBay Inc.’s enterprise business after investors shunned the debt, according to people with knowledge of the deal. The bank has been trying to sell the loans since mid-October and continues to hold the debt even after EBay said on Nov. 2 that the sale was completed. Morgan Stanley has discussed a steeper discount to lure buyers and has been probing investors in recent days about the price at which they may be willing to buy the debt, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. One concern investors have raised is that the company’s projected earnings may be too optimistic. Buyout targets often make adjustments to forecast earnings, called add-backs, that can reduce a borrower’s leverage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHP Inc plunges after printer business underwhelms:\\xa0Shares of HP Inc, which houses former Hewlett-Packard Co\\'s legacy hardware business, plunged 16.3 percent on Wednesday after the company\\'s lackluster results fueled concerns about its ability to weather a slowdown in the printer and PC markets. HP Inc\\'s revenue from both its printer and PC businesses fell 14 percent each in the fourth quarter, their worst performance in the year ended Oct. 31, and forecast current-quarter profit below market expectations.\"Things got worse. Not only did they not get better - they got worse,\" said Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities.HP Inc Chief Executive Dion Weisler called the printing business a \"much greater challenge\" than the PC business.The company has been cutting printer prices to tackle stiff competition, particularly from Japanese printer makers Canon and Epson.However, the price cuts, coupled with the effect of a stronger dollar, have reduced the value of income from overseas markets.Revenue from HP Inc\\'s printer supplies such as ink cartridges and laser toner fell 10 percent this quarter. Supplies account for most of the profits for HP Inc.HP Inc\\'s PC unit has been suffering as sales have been falling worldwide for several quarters and the launch of Windows 10 has so far failed to rekindle the industry.\"Ultimately I think (HP Inc), the way it\\'s structured, it\\'s going to be more of a sort of dividend yield play,\" said Jeffrey Fidacaro, an analyst.HP Inc\\'s sibling, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, saw its shares rise as much as 8.5 percent on Wednesday, after it maintained its profit forecast for fiscal 2016.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZenefits Under Investigation For Allegedly Allowing Unlicensed Brokers To Sell Health Insurance:\\xa0Cloud HR platform Zenefits may have allowed salespeople to illegally act as insurance agents in at least seven states. According to a BuzzFeed investigative report, the startup let unlicensed brokers sell health insurance, leading to at least one commissioner to investigate in Washington State. Those unlicensed solicitations go back to at least the summer of 2014, and the Washington State office of the insurance commissioner started looking at the potential violations earlier this year, according to the report. This is not the first time Zenefits has faced legal scrutiny for possible insurance violations. The Utah Insurance Department took the startup to task over claims it was illegally giving insurance software away for free. Regulators at the time said that the company violated local laws and that it was unfair to traditional insurance brokers. Utah legislators threw out the complaint and let Zenefits get back to business after both the Utah House and Senate overwhelmingly voted to let the startup continue operations. The broker license violation looks a bit more serious and could be considered a Class B felony, under Washington State law. Violators may be subject to a prison sentence of up to 10 years as well as face a $20,000 fine. According to the report, Zenefits execs may have known about the violations and were aware of the consequences, but were prompted to get sales agents licensed in the state only after learning of the insurance commission’s investigation. State records show 22 agents became licensed brokers just days after the report said Zenefits realized there was a state inquiry. The startup has since launched a “license management system” to help track which sales agents are properly licensed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook’s Internet.org Now Available Throughout India:\\xa0Internet.org, Facebook’s initiative to provide free Internet services in developing countries, is now available to all Indians through the Free Basics app on Reliance Communication’s network. The project is meant to give people in emerging economies easy access to the Internet, but has been hit by a slew of criticism. Reliance Communications is India’s fourth-largest telecom operator, with about 110 million subscribers as of June. According to its site, Free Basics will enable users to use Facebook and Facebook Messenger and access sites like Wikipedia, BBC News, Bing Search, Dictionary.com, and local news services. Detractors say that by making a handful of services available on its platform, Internet.org gives preferential treatment to its partners, therefore violating the tenets of net neutrality. In response, Facebook founder and chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg said Internet.org will focus on offering basic services for free (hence the branding of its app) and is not meant to limit access to other providers. The company has also taken steps to make joining Free Basics easier to join for developers and other potential partners. This has done little to ameliorate critics who are concerned about the potential drawbacks of having a company as large and powerful as Facebook control what millions of new Internet users see. In addition to India, Free Basics is available in 30 countries throughout Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple plans to launch Apple Pay in China by February: WSJ\\xa0Apple Inc (AAPL.O) plans to launch its mobile payment system Apple Pay in China by early February, the Wall Street Journal reported. The iPhone maker has struck deals recently with China\\'s big four state-run banks, the newspaper reported late Monday, citing people familiar with the discussions. When launched, Apple Pay will mainly compete with Alipay, the online payment platform run by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, and UnionPay, a state-controlled consortium that has a monopoly on all yuan payment cards issued and used in the country. Apple\\'s plans could still face regulatory hurdles in China, where banking and e-commerce are overseen by a number of government agencies, WSJ said. Launched in the United States in October last year, Apple is bringing its payment service to China, the most important market for smartphones. The company\\'s sales nearly doubled in Greater China in its fiscal fourth quarter from a year earlier. The amount Apple would make off such transactions has been a sticking point in negotiations to bring Apple Pay to China, the Journal quoted the people as saying.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle’s Answer to Facebook Instant Articles Gets (Tentative) Launch Date, Ad Partners:\\xa0Accelerated Mobile Pages, Google’s initiative for mobile news publishing and its open source riposte to similar efforts from Facebook and Apple, is arriving “early next year,” the company said in a post on Tuesday. Last month, Google rolled out a preview version of the product, which Re/code readers learned of first. Google has already roped in marquee publishers, including* the New York Times, Washington Post and BBC. Some 1,600-plus newspapers and television stations have “voiced their support,” according to Google. On Tuesday, the company also announced it had signed up a slew of analytics and advertising providers for the back end.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHewlett-Packard ended its life as one public company with a whimper.\\xa0For the quarter that ended Oct. 30, Hewlett-Packard had net earnings of $1.32 billion, or 73 cents a share. Revenue was $25.7 billion, down 9 percent from a year earlier. The earnings were below Wall Street’s expectations, which used nonstandard accounting popular in analyzing tech companies. By the nonstandard formula, HP earned 93 cents a share. Analysts had expected HP to make 96 cents a share, on revenue of $26.4 billion, according to a survey by FactSet. Shares of HP Inc. were down more than 7 percent in after-hours trading Tuesday, while HPE shares were up more than 2 percent. Of the two firms, Ms. Whitman’s HPE drew more attention, as she is trying to remake a business that sold things like computer servers and data networking into something with more software and high-value services, which can compete in the era of cloud computing. HP, considered the grandfather of Silicon Valley, began November as two separate entities. One, called HP Inc., sells primarily personal computers and printers. The other, HPE, sells computer hardware, software and services that are used by large companies. Meg Whitman, who was chief executive of the old HP and now runs HPE, split the entity in the hope of increasing efficiency and growth. After months of planning, the two companies began operating separate financial reporting systems in August, although they were legally one company until Oct. 30. Ms. Whitman’s strategy now is led by high-value consulting, in particular helping customers in planning, managing, protecting and using hybrid cloud and on-site systems to get and analyze more data, faster. Next week HPE and Microsoft are expected to make a joint announcement that Microsoft is a “preferred partner,” meaning they will make sales calls together and recommend each other to customers. It is a plausible plan, Mr. Bittman said, that only needs revenue and profits. “It’s a good series of slides, but we need to see it in action,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon Challenger Jet.com Announces $350 Million Investment, Eyes $150 Million More:\\xa0E-commerce startup Jet.com announced a $350 million cash infusion Tuesday led by Fidelity Investments, providing money to help the company attract customers during its first holiday shopping season. An additional $150 million investment is “expected shortly,” the Hoboken, New Jersey-based company said Tuesday in a statement. The investment values Jet at $1 billion before the new funding round, the company said. Jet, which began operations in July, offers free shipping on orders exceeding $35 without a membership. Web giant Amazon.com Inc. charges customers $99 annually for delivery discounts. Founded by former Amazon executive Marc Lore, Jet is trying to undercut its chief rival’s prices to attract customers. Last month, it abandoned a $50 subscription membership fee. The total value of merchandise sold on Jet was $33.2 million in October, an increase of 65 percent from September, the company said in the statement. Jet expects to end the year with gross merchandise value of $500 million on an annualized basis. Jet offers customers unique ways to save on orders, including discounts for paying with a debit card or waiving their right to return products they buy. Consumers can also amass savings by loading up their carts with more items, which minimizes the number of shipments. Jet is attracting new customers by subsidizing their purchases with big discounts, which is a lower-cost way of gaining business than advertising, said a person familiar with the matter. The company is considering offering an option to buy online and pick up in a store with its retail partners, which would help Jet compete with Amazon’s larger inventory and faster shipping, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the strategy is private.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTango, Chat App Unicorn, Lays Off 9% Of Staff Following Failed Move Into E-Commerce:\\xa0Tango, the mobile messaging unicorn that reached a billion-dollar valuation when Alibaba invested $280 million in it early last year, has laid off around 9 percent of its workforce after it shuttered a brief effort at e-commerce. The Mountain View-based company launched an in-app commerce feature powered by Alibaba and Walmart back in May of this year, initially in the U.S. market, but it has confirmed to TechCrunch that ‘Tango Shop’ was closed down last month, leading to the lay-off off around 30 employees working on it. “The initiative didn’t really pan out,” Tango CTO Eric Setton told TechCrunch. “We didn’t see the conversations we wanted. [There was a] good amount of traffic but the volume didn’t materialize. [We recently] updated the app to take the e-commerce flow out, but unfortunately couldn’t keep the team working on that initiative.” Following the reorganization, Tango now has 270 staff across its U.S. office and a smaller presence in Beijing, China. Interestingly, one high-profile exit from that reshuffle was Chi-Chao Chang — formerly VP of Tango Labs and the lead on Tango’s commerce initiative — who is now working at Facebook, although he is involved with the social network’s search business not Messenger. Despite the retrenchment, Setton claimed Tango is on track to have its highest quarter of revenue to date. “This year, [revenue] is an order of magnitude above what we’ve ever seen before,” he said, although he declined to provide a specific revenue figure. Setton also declined to give an update on Tango’s current user base. The last figure given by the company came in May, at the launch of Tango Shop, when it claimed 300 million registered users. That wasn’t a big jump on the 200 million registered users that it announced in March 2014, when Alibaba invested and Tango announced its first (and only) monthly active user count: 70 million. The lack of fresh user metrics suggests that Tango’s user growth is stalling, particularly as the mobile messaging scene matures and network effects come into play to drive users to the most established, more popular apps. Because, after all, chat apps are about chatting, which is hard to do if your friends all moved to Snapchat (estimated at 100 million monthly users), Kik (240 million registered users), Facebook Messenger (700 million monthly users) or WhatsApp (900 million monthly users).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlphabet Trying to Mix Heft With Start-Up Agility:\\xa0Alphabet was created to separate Google, the search giant, from the constellation of appendages — the self-driving cars, the pharmaceutical company, the two venture capital funds — that many current and former employees say had made the company too sprawling to manage. The last three months of 2015 were the first quarter of the new holding company’s life, and the contours of the organization are starting to fall into place. It has hired new leaders, such as an auto industry veteran who was recently tapped to run the self-driving-car project. It is developing new processes, like an internal system that would have Alphabet companies pay Google for dull but important services like human resources, accounting or access to Google’s technological infrastructure, according to people familiar with the matter, something first reported by The Wall Street Journal. These are normal processes in large companies, used to make sure business units have a handle on expenses. But the company is also asking questions about how it might achieve the dream that has eluded so many other big companies: find a way to take advantage of its heft while being nimble like a start-up. Larry Page, Google’s co-founder and chief executive of Alphabet, has said that he wants his company to be a home for entrepreneurs. If the Alphabet concept plays out as advertised, company chiefs would have more autonomy to make strategic decisions on such matters as whom they hire and how they spend money, or even to raise their public profiles. But the pitch — in particular to acquisition targets — is also about what they would not have to do. They would not have to worry about building a large server infrastructure for their technology to run on. They would not have to worry about whether to use their money to hire another accountant or another engineer. In the case of more mature companies, they could skip the mounds of paperwork and reporting requirements that come with going public. That broad idea — that entrepreneurs do best when they are focused squarely on new technology rather than distracted by corporate building blocks that every company needs but also take lots of time to build — has taken root across Silicon Valley. It is why, in addition to money, venture capital firms now give their companies access to all kinds of marketing, sales and other services in hopes that their start-ups can more quickly become grown-ups. The first good glimpse of all this will come early next year, when Alphabet, for the first time, will separate Google’s search and advertising businesses from Alphabet’s more speculative divisions. But it will take months or years for Alphabet to figure out how to create the best of all possible worlds. If such a thing exists.\\n\\n\\nWhen and Where Do Black Friday\\'s Biggest Crowds Actually Hit?\\xa0Google\\'s look at foot traffic finds a few surprises: \\xa0Google wants to help shoppers navigate the wretched non-holiday known as Black Friday. Today, the online Santa of search is showing when and where people head for doorbusters. Pulling aggregated, anonymized data from Google Maps users, the company is revealing for the first time traffic insights for various retailers in the month leading up to Christmas Eve. The data isn\\'t just relevant to shoppers. Understanding peak traffic for shopping malls, department stores, electronic stores, cellphone stores, discount stores and dollar stores could help marketers better reach consumers when they\\'re keenest to buy. Google also announced today it would provide a more detailed view of offline measurement by giving advertisers the ability to break out store visits at a keyword or ad-group level. \"By reviewing data at this level, advertisers can understand which keywords or ad groups drive the most store visits,\" according to a Google blog post. \"For example, a toy store may learn that certain dolls or action figures bring in the most visitors. With this insight, that toy store might invest in search terms that drive both online and offline sales, and display those products at the front of their store.\" Here are a few key insights from Google\\'s foot-traffic analysis: Store traffic peaks between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. on Black Friday, with Thanksgiving Day department store visitors peaking between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. Shopping malls, superstores and discount stores experience the highest traffic on the Saturday before Christmas. Dollar stores are busiest on Christmas Eve.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe U.S releases draft regulations for drones:\\xa0Proposed Regulations for Drones Are Released in the US: On Monday, the Federal Aviation Administration, scurrying to prepare for hundreds of thousands of more drones flying into the air, released a list of recommendations for how to better monitor recreational use of the machines. Under the proposal, most drone owners would have to register the machines with the federal government, which would place the information in a national database, the first such requirements. The recommendations, from a task force created by the agency, would be the biggest step yet by the government to deal with the proliferation of recreational drones, which are usually used for harmless purposes but have also been tools for mischief and serious wrongdoing, and pose a risk to airborne jets. The F.A.A. is widely expected to approve the bulk of the recommendations in the next month, just in time for Christmas.

The government already has rules that limit the use of drones for commercial purposes, like delivering packages. But attention has turned to recreational use more recently, as drones, many of them the size of a laptop computer, have emerged as a must-have item for thousands of people. The Consumer Technology Association, a trade group, has estimated that 400,000 drones will be sold this holiday season in the United States.\\n\\n\\nDeliveroo, an On-Demand Food Delivery Service, Raises $100 Million:\\xa0On Monday, Deliveroo, an on-demand food delivery service based in London, announced that it had raised $100 million from investors, including DST Global, an early backer of Facebook, to help push the service into new markets, particularly in Asia and the Middle East. In total, the start-up has now raised roughly $200 million since its creation in 2012. Just about four months ago, Deliveroo raised $70 million to expand beyond its British roots. The company provides a one-size-fits-all offering for nontech savvy restaurants that includes food packaging, delivery drivers and other support so individuals can order the restaurants’ food through smartphones. As part of the new fund raising, Deliveroo expects to branch out into highly populated cities across Asia, including Hong Kong and Singapore. Mr. Shu said there were no plans in the short term to offer the service in the United States, though the start-up now operates in 50 cities in 12 countries, primarily in Europe. While online food delivery companies like GrubHub and Just Eat, its European counterpart, have allowed people to order food through smartphones for years, a new generation of start-ups like Deliveroo are trying to extend that offering to restaurants that do not have their own delivery logistics. That group includes Delivery Hero, based in Berlin, which also offers a fleet of drivers and other logistical support to restaurants looking to expand into online orders. Delivery Hero is valued at $3.1 billion and operates across Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. Other tech companies, including Uber, the ride-booking service, now offer similar products. Yet for Mr. Shu of Deliveroo, these rivals are only a small fraction of his overall competition, which also includes people cooking for themselves at home and traditional restaurants.\\n\\n\\nAmazon Makes Holiday Shopping Season Tough for Target and Walmart:\\xa0Neither Target nor Walmart needed a reminder about the distance between their online businesses and Amazon’s. Their third-quarter sales numbers provided it anyway. Walmart’s online sales grew just 10 percent in the third quarter, slower than the 15 percent industry average, while Target’s grew 20 percent, well below the company’s stated goal of 30 percent, the companies announced last week. These numbers might not spell all-out trouble if it weren’t for Amazon’s performance during the same period: The company’s electronics and general merchandise business — basically the core of its retail operation — grew 35 percent in North America in the quarter, marking the segment’s highest growth rate in several years. The third-quarter headwinds of the traditional retailers coupled with Amazon’s momentum makes this e-commerce holiday season an even more critical one for Walmart and Target. It doesn’t help that Amazon’s huge logistics investments over the last few years mean it can flex its muscles the most during the holiday with its arsenal of express shipping capabilities when customers are often looking for last-minute gifts. If Walmart and Target going to close the gap, now has to be the time. But history isn’t on their side.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce Valued At $4.5B, \\xa0LivingSocial Offers a Cautionary Tale to Today’s Unicorns:\\xa0The first thing you see when walking into the headquarters of LivingSocial is row upon row of mostly empty desks, broken up by small street signs that employees once needed to find one another when the office teemed with people. One row, “BYFAD Lane,” was named after a start-up, BuyYourFriendADrink, which LivingSocial acquired to get into the daily deals business. Other signs, such as “Sky Diving Street,” were named for some of the hottest discount coupons that the company once provided. On a recent visit, some desks were piled high with boxes of employee belongings, the detritus left behind after a round of layoffs that eliminated one-fifth of the work force. In one refrigerator, the milk was six months old. The technology industry’s boom over the last few years has been defined by the rise of “unicorns,” the private companies that investors have valued at $1 billion or more. Before the term came into vogue, LivingSocial was among the biggest unicorns of its day. It now offers a glimpse of what some of today’s unicorns might look like several years down the road if things go awry. Just four years ago, LivingSocial and its larger rival Groupon grew rapidly on a simple pitch: The companies would match customers to local businesses with a daily deal in users’ inboxes, like half off at a local deli or a two-for-one massage promotion. LivingSocial and Groupon would take a cut of each transaction. Venture capitalists anointed daily deals as the way that the Internet would invade local business, and by late 2011 LivingSocial had raised more than $800 million and reached a valuation of $4.5 billion, according to data from the research firm VC Experts. The company counted Amazon and the mutual fund giant T. Rowe Price among its investors. LivingSocial spent heavily, blanketing the airwaves with TV ad campaigns. Riding a wave of momentum, the company explored going public. Today, LivingSocial is more unicorpse than unicorn. The company never filed for an initial public offering and consumer fervor for daily deals has cooled. T. Rowe Price has written down its stake in LivingSocial to nearly zero, data from Morningstar shows. The company’s work force has shrunk to around 800 employees from 4,500 at its peak in 2011. Groupon, which did go public, is trading at more than 85 percent below its I.P.O. price.\\n\\n\\nAirbnb raises $100 million in funding, Valuation stays flat at $25.5B:\\xa0source: Apartment-sharing startup Airbnb Inc has raised over $100 million in a new round of funding, a source close to the company said. Airbnb, once a startup selling cereal, expects to achieve profitability in 2016, the source said. Airbnb revenue doubled to $340 million in the third quarter on bookings of $2.2 billion, the source said. The company expects revenue of $900 million this year. The round was done at the same $25.5 billion valuation as the previous funding round over the summer, indicating that unicorns, or private tech companies worth $1 billion or more, are finding it tougher to convince investors to buy shares at continuously escalating valuations.\\n\\n\\nSnapchat\\'s lackluster ad business threatens $16 billion valuation:\\xa0Snapchat, maker of a free mobile app that lets users send videos and messages that disappear in seconds, is struggling to gain traction with advertisers, fuelling investor concern that its $16 billion valuation isn\\'t justified by a business that hasn\\'t yet shown it has a steady source of income. Even in a world where upwards of 140 private companies are reckoned to be worth $1 billion or more, Snapchat\\'s outsized value stands out. Fidelity Investments\\' decision to slash the estimated value of its Snapchat stake by 25 percent in the third quarter exacerbated concern about the company\\'s ability to meet advertisers\\' expectations. For Snapchat advertisers, the question is whether prices that can reach more than $500,000 for some ads is worth it when the company lags competitors in targeting specific consumers and measuring how ads perform. \"If Snapchat doesn\\'t get that figured out, they\\'re in trouble,\" said Nick Godfrey, chief operating officer at RAIN, a digital strategy agency. Snapchat lost more than $128 million in the first 11 months of 2014, according to a financial statement leaked earlier this year, which also showed Snapchat had revenue of $3.1 million. Its advertising business began in mid-October. Tech media outlet Re/code estimated that Snapchat\\'s revenue could reach $50 million in 2015, citing sources familiar with the company. Snapchat doesn\\'t comment on its revenue or its losses. The company has raised $1.2 billion from investors, ample resources to develop its advertising techniques. But time may be limited as the company is in early discussions for an IPO, according to sources. Snapchat\\'s $16 billion valuation was calculated at its most recent funding round in May based on how much investors were willing to pay for shares.\\n\\n\\nYelp Surges as Investors See Bargain Buying Opportunity:\\xa0Yelp Inc. shares surged the most in six months Friday as investors see the customer-review website at bargain prices after it lost almost half of its value this year. Shares jumped 11 percent to close at $31.21 in New York, the biggest increase since May 7 and the highest price since July 28. Yelp shares plummeted July 29 after the company cut its revenue forecast and said it would stop selling national brand advertising. The stock is down 43 percent this year. Yelp Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Stoppelman is trying to convince investors the company is on the right track by boosting its local advertising sales force and pulling back from banner ads from national brands that aren’t getting responses from Yelp users. The move is part of Yelp’s shift to mobile users, who make up a larger portion of its audience than desktop users.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle aims for China launch of Google Play app store next year:\\xa0Google, part of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), aims to launch the China version of its Google Play smartphone app store next year, according to people familiar with the matter, its first major foray in the market since ending localized product support in 2010. The Google Play app store would be set up specifically for China, and not connected to overseas versions of Google Play, two of the people said. They said Google intends to comply with Chinese laws on filtering content that might be viewed as sensitive by the ruling Communist Party, and laws requiring the company to store the app store\\'s data within China.\\n\\n\\nJawbone Lays Off 60, 15% Of Staff Globally, Closes NY Office.\\xa0Some difficult news this week for Jawbone, maker of fitness trackers, speakers and Bluetooth headsets. TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that the company yesterday laid off around 60 employees, or 15% of staff. It’s a global round of layoffs affecting all areas of the business; and as part of it Jawbone is also closing down its New York office (which was concentrated on marketing) and downsizing satellite operations in Sunnyvale and Pittsburgh. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson said the layoffs are part of a wider “streamlining.” From what we understand, there are no specific product areas being cut as part of this restructuring. The company, in other words, will continue to sell its Jambox speakers and the Era headset, along with related accessories. More generally, however, Jawbone has been increasingly focusing is R&D, product and marketing attention on its range of UP fitness trackers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuccessful Tech IPO#1:\\xa0Shares of Square Soar by 45% After Public Offering:\\xa0Square began trading as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, at one point surging more than 64 percent above its initial public offering price of $9. It ended the day up 45 percent, closing at $13.07. The first-day pop followed a turbulent I.P.O. process for the six-year-old company, one that was marred by questions over pricing and valuation and that arrived in the face of a precarious public market for technology offerings. On Wednesday, when Square had priced its shares at $9, that was lower than the $11 to $13 range it had set, putting its valuation at $2.9 billion, well below the $6 billion price tag that private investors had valued the company at last year. As recently as Wednesday, advisers laid out options for Square including pulling the deal, three people briefed on the discussions said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, but for Square, that was not a consideration. \\xa0“We have a great beginning,” said Jack Dorsey, Square’s chief, striking an upbeat note in an interview on Thursday, which was his 39th birthday. “I don’t see negativity as necessarily something that detracts from our work.” The I.P.O. ordeal illustrates the difficulties — some might say guesswork — of accurately valuing companies, both when they are private and when they go public. And Square, which closed its first day trading with a market capitalization of $4.4 billion, now faces the challenge of moving on from the fund-raising event, solidifying its business and building itself up. “I want to get back to a steady state and back to business,” Mr. Dorsey said. He added that Square’s strategy now was “to continue to save people trips to the bank. We’re not going out there to say we’re getting rid of the banks or card networks. We’ve just put a much cleaner face on that infrastructure.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSucessful Tech IPO#2:\\xa0Investors \\'swipe right\\' in Tinder-owner Match\\'s debut:\\xa0Shares of media mogul Barry Diller\\'s Match Group, the owner of popular dating site Match.com and mobile app Tinder, jumped as much as 24 percent in their market debut on Thursday, valuing the company at $3.57 billion. Match Group, which touts itself as the world\\'s No. 1 dating company, is seen as the crown jewel of Diller\\'s media properties and has driven parent IAC/InterActiveCorp\\'s (IACI.O) profit and revenue in recent quarters. The U.S. online romance market, worth more than $2 billion a year, has thrived as instant messaging, photo-sharing and geolocation services grow in popularity. One of Match Group\\'s most popular offerings is Tinder, a mobile app on which people \"swipe right\" or \"swipe left\" to signal their willingness – or not – to meet prospective partners.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook Makes It Easier to Move On After a Breakup:\\xa0Breaking up is now a little easier to do, at least on Facebook, thanks to a new feature that lets people untangle themselves from a relationship without cutting ties altogether. The operator of the world\\'s biggest social network introduced a tool on Thursday for users to \"take a break\" after changing the status of a relationship with another person, letting them see less of an ex\\'s posts without blocking or unfriending them. People can also tell Facebook to show an ex less information. While the feature might seem intrusive, it\\'s become more necessary as Facebook has worked to highlight a user\\'s most important relationships. The company is using its data to make better suggestions, such as who should be invited to events or whose birthdays are more important to celebrate. For example, Facebook has been serving up flashback memories of older posts, which, after a breakup, could bring back bad memories. And Facebook doesn\\'t want to drive away any of its 1.55 billion users. The tools are more subtle than unfriending or unfollowing someone—the ex won\\'t see any changes. Twitter, which lets users know if they were blocked, came up with a similar option last year, adding a \"mute\" button that would keep users from seeing someone\\'s posts without letting them know. Facebook\\'s new breakup feature is also reversible—just in case.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPatron of Indian start-ups\\xa0Tiger Global to tone down current aggressive style; to come up with two-track approach in giving money to companies:\\xa0Tiger Global Management, the most prolific backer of startups in India, has decided to tone down its current aggressive style here, several people aware of the thinking at the US firm said, in a reflection of the limits of its strategy so far as well as the changing investor mood. Tiger, which is based in New York with private investments led by Lee Fixel, is coming up with a twotrack approach when it comes to giving money to companies in its portfolio, conversations with founders and investors reveal. The ones that are in leadership positions in the market can expect Fixel to keep his purse strings open, but not the laggards which have been told to fend for themselves. They must obtain validation from investors other than Tiger to lead new rounds and get unit economics right with positive operating margins. One of the founders who met Fixel recounted the conversation thus: \"I will be leading very few investments in the next six to eight months, but if you use your cash and survive this cycle, then the pressure will ease out.\" Tiger, which is the main backer of India\\'s most valuable startup Flipkart and owns significant stakes in the country\\'s largest cab aggregator Ola, has invested around $2 billion (Rs 13,000 crore) in over 35 Indian companies. This year it has been even more active than in the past, but that has changed along with the onset of a more cautious mood about throwing large sums of money at consumer internet ventures.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTrailing in the Cloud, Google Taps VMware Founder to Chase Amazon:\\xa0With its cloud business, Google finds itself in a rare position: Behind. The search giant has toyed with different enterprise products for years, with limited success, and now faces fierce competition from Microsoft and Amazon. But Google is signaling that it is serious about building an enterprise business. And here is its biggest sign: Alphabet has tapped Diane Greene, a founder and former CEO of the software company VMware, to run it. Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, announced the move in a blog post. Therein he said Greene, who has been a Google board member since 2012, will take over “all our cloud businesses, including Google for Work, Cloud Platform and Google Apps.” The move includes an acquisition of Greene’s new company, Bebop. Pichai describes it as a “new development platform that makes it easy to build and maintain enterprise applications.” Google isn’t sharing a price on the deal. Greene is joining at a moment when Google’s cloud efforts, both on the application and the infrastructure side, seem to be spinning. Three years ago, the narrative about Google Apps was how it was so often displacing Microsoft Office with its word processing and spreadsheet apps that run in a browser. Now that Microsoft Office has gotten the cloud religion with Office 365, which runs both as an on-premise version and in the cloud, the narrative around Google Apps has shifted in the last year or so: It’s now described generally as “doing well with small businesses,” even though Google itself still touts the fact that 60 percent of the Fortune 500 use it. Still, the cloud world has just gotten a lot more competitive. On Tuesday, Microsoft announced Office Graph, a set of unified APIs that will let third-party developers build add-ons and apps that enhance how Microsoft Office works. This hiring seems a partial response to that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSquare prices shares at 52% discount to last valuation in disappointing turn to long-awaited IPO: sources:\\xa0Mobile payments company Square Inc priced shares at $9 late on Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter, further discounting the company\\'s valuation before it begins trading Thursday morning. Square has raised $243.5 million in its Wall Street debut, about $80 million less than expected. The price set on Wednesday puts Square\\'s market capitalization at $2.9 billion, a 52 percent drop from the $6 billion valuation it had earned at its last private funding round. San Francisco-based Square, led by CEO Jack Dorsey, earlier this month set a price range of $11 to $13, well below the $15.46 per-share price of its most recent private financing. The steeper discount to $9 - a 42 percent drop from what investors were willing to pay a year ago - suggests widespread uncertainty about the profitability of the payments industry and the future of Square itself, which has seen slowing revenue growth. \"The way that Square was valued as a private company is they were just going to disrupt everything and change payments,\" said Andrew Chanin, CEO of PureFunds, an exchange-traded fund for mobile payments companies. \"And the reality is not that.\" Compounding concerns is Dorsey\\'s dual role running Twitter Inc., a social media company struggling for a turnaround. Founded in 2009, the company started as a way for small businesses to accept credit card payments through mobile devices. It has evolved to a suite of small business services, relying on partnerships with companies such as Apple and Visa. The valuation cut triggered a ratchet, or protection investors wrote into previous funding rounds, that requires Square to sell several million additional shares. Square will begin trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"SQ\". Square is one of the most prominent \"unicorns,\" or private companies valued at $1 billion or more, to plan a public debut this year. Many have held up Square as an example of how fleeting - and at times nonsensical - private market valuations can be. There are more than 140 \"unicorns\" globally.\\n\\n\\nMatch Prices Its IPO at Bottom of Proposed Range\\xa0as Tinder CEO Breaks Quiet Period Rule with a Bizarre Interview\\xa0(\"Models Beg Me For Sex\")\\xa0Match has priced its IPO at $12 per share, raising $400 million . The company will begin trading on the Nasdaq tomorrow, under the ticker symbol ‘MTCH.’ The $12 per share is at the bottom of the anticipated $12 to $14 proposed price range and gives the company a market cap of roughly $2.9 billion. Square, which is also going public tomorrow, just priced its IPO at $9, below the $11 to $13 price range. Match owns a group of dating companies, including OkCupid and the infamous Tinder. That particular subsidiary came under fire today after its leader gave a bizarre interview that may have broken SEC-mandated “quiet period” rules.\\xa0Tinder CEO Sean Rad: Models Beg Me for Sex:, Dick Pics Aren’t Cool: Tinder’s parent company, the IAC-owned Match Group, is going public tomorrow. As the most attractive and valuable part of the company, it makes sense that Tinder’s CEO, Sean Rad, is talking to media outlets to drum up excitement for the IPO. This morning, a fresh Tinder PR disaster dropped in the form of an interview with journalist Charlotte Edwardes in the London Evening Standard. In it, Rad talks about the number of women he’s slept with (“Is 20 low?”), confuses the word sapiosexual for sodomy and condemns fame-hungry journalists. It makes sense that Rad would say some really, really stupid things in an interview. Rad was the dude who mishandled a sexual misconduct scandal (and the resulting lawsuit) that led to the exit of co-founder and CMO Justin Mateen last year. Rad stepped down as CEO last November, but got a second chance at the top job after his successor, former Microsoft exec Chris Payne, was canned in the wake of a memorable Twitter meltdown. The interview is very long and there are many different great parts. Below is perhaps the best selection from it (here’s another one: “I do not condone penis pictures — that is just not who I am”). I’m sure it will inspire a lot of confidence in investors looking to buy Match Group stock tomorrow: He’s desperate to impress on me how gallant he is, citing the fact that a “supermodel, someone really, really famous” has been “begging” him for sex “and I’ve been like, no.” She’s “taunted” him, he says, and “called me a prude.” “She’s one of the most beautiful women I’ve ever seen but it doesn’t mean that I want to rip her clothes off and have sex with her. Attraction is nuanced. I’ve been attracted to women who are …” he pauses “… well, who my friends might think are ugly. I don’t care if someone is a model. Really. It sounds clichéd and almost totally unbelievable for a guy to say this, but it’s true. I need an intellectual challenge.” He continues: “Apparently there’s a term for someone who gets turned on by intellectual stuff. You know, just talking. What’s the word?” His face creases with the effort of trying to remember. “I want to say ‘sodomy’?”\\n\\n\\nHow Amazon’s Long Game Yielded a Retail Juggernaut:\\xa0Shares of Jeff Bezos’s company have doubled in value so far in 2015, pushing Amazon into the world’s 10 largest companies by stock market value, where it jockeys for position with General Electric and is far ahead of Walmart. There is a simple explanation for Amazon’s rise, and also a second, more complicated one. The simple story involves Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud-computing business, which rents out vast amounts of server space to other companies. Amazon began disclosing A.W.S.’s financial performance in April, and the numbers showed that selling server space was a much bigger business than anyone had realized. Deutsche Bank estimates that A.W.S., which is less than a decade old, could soon be worth $160 billion as a stand-alone company. That’s more valuable than Intel. Yet the disclosure of A.W.S.’s size has obscured a deeper change at Amazon. For years, observers have wondered if Amazon’s shopping business — you know, its main business — could ever really work. Investors gave Mr. Bezos enormous leeway to spend billions building out a distribution-center infrastructure, but it remained a semi-open question if the scale and pace of investments would ever pay off. Could this company ever make a whole lot of money selling so much for so little? As we embark upon another holiday shopping season, the answer is becoming clear: Yes, Amazon can make money selling stuff. In the flood of rapturous reviews from stock analysts over the company’s earnings report last month, several noted that Amazon’s retail operations had reached a “critical scale” or an “inflection point.” They meant that Amazon’s enormous investments in infrastructure and logistics have begun to pay off. The company keeps capturing a larger slice of American and even international purchases. It keeps attracting more users to its Prime fast-shipping subscription program, and, albeit slowly, it is beginning to scratch out higher profits from shoppers.\\n\\n\\nGoldman Says to Buy Apple Because It\\'s Becoming a Services Company:\\xa0It\\'s time to stop thinking of Apple as a hardware company and start thinking of it as a service company. At least, that\\'s what Goldman Analyst Simona Jankowski and her team are telling clients as they add the stock to their \"conviction buy\" list and call for a price of $163 in the next 12 months. \\xa0\"We expect that over the next year, the focus will shift from unit growth (which is slowing given a maturing smartphone market) to installed base monetization and recurring revenues (“Apple-as-a-Service”). Apple’s model has already tilted that way with its new iPhone 6s installment plans, and we see the upcoming TV service as a powerful next step.\" Due to Apple\\'s large and loyal customer base, the team argues that there is a \"significant multi-year opportunity\" for the tech giant to boost monetization. Jankowski\\'s team estimates that over 90 percent of those purchasing iPhones are repeat customers, which will make it much easier for Apple to become a service-like company, especially as it launches a TV service. The timing might prove perfect for a foray into the TV space as well, with Goldman pointing towards acceleration in cord cutting as millennials are more apt to use what it refers to as \"over-the-top media consumption,\" and the skinny bundles such as Sling TV and Vue become more common. \"Theoretically, Apple could transition other products to installment plans as well, and charge customers a monthly bill that also includes its other services such as Apple TV and Music. We think a potential live TV service from Apple would be a key enabler of this transition to an “Apple-as-a-Service” business model.\" The shift to a service model could prove to dramatically increase Apple\\'s average revenue per user (ARPU). Jankowski estimates that Apple\\'s current ARPU would be $42 operating with a service business model.\\n\\n\\nAs Lyft Seeks $500M in New Funding,\\xa0Leaked Lyft Financials Show the Struggles of Being No. 2 Behind Uber:\\xa0In the first half of the year, the ride-sharing company generated less revenue, lost more money, and added fewer customers than projected in February. Ride-sharing pioneer Lyft is heading back to the fundraising till, but its numbers may not look that rosy to investors. The company lost $127 million in the first half of 2015 on $46.7 million in revenue, according to private fundraising documents obtained by Bloomberg. Lyft, the second-biggest U.S. ride-hailing service, is raising roughly $500 million as the company burns through tens of millions of dollars a month, according to a fundraising presentation compiled by Credit Suisse. It highlights tepid financial performance at Lyft and reveals that the company has repeatedly underperformed its own expectations. In the first half of the year, Lyft generated less revenue, lost more money, and added fewer customers than projected in February. The numbers suggest Lyft has had to burn through cash as it chases growth in a competitive industry. The willingness to spend big on growth is a costly strategy that’s becoming increasingly common in Silicon Valley. Public market investors have expressed concern about the high valuations of private technology companies recently. Fidelity Investments, BlackRock, and others wrote down their stakes in some startups this year.In the first half of 2015, Lyft spent $96.1 million on marketing. That’s more than twice Lyft’s net revenue during the same period. In one document, Lyft promotes its ability to attract new drivers and riders, even as it does so at a sizable loss. Customer discounts represent a big portion of Lyft’s marketing costs. This year, Lyft has also purchased billboards in New York’s Times Square and on Market Street in San Francisco, in addition to paying drivers big bonuses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEarnest, Fueled by Growth in Student Loans, Raises $275 Million: At the start of this year, Earnest was an intriguing but small entrant in an emerging field of start-ups using new tools of data and software to analyze credit risk and make consumer loans. Its loans were typically a few thousand dollars for things like relocation expenses and professional training. But today, the lender, based in San Francisco, is growing at a torrid pace, and on Tuesday it announced a $275 million round of debt and equity to fund further expansion. Already this year, Earnest has made 50 times as many loans as last year, and it is lending from $2 million to $5 million every day, said Louis Beryl, a co-founder and chief executive. In this round, $75 million is equity investment, and $200 million is debt funding. The debt portion is led by New York Life. The new financing brings the total raised by Earnest, founded in 2013, to $325 million. Earnest now employees 165 people, up from 30 at the start of this year. Mr. Beryl says he plans to hire about 200 more employees over the next year, especially technical people like software engineers, data scientists and user-experience designers. The long-term goal, he said, is to “build a platform for the next generation of consumer financial services.” The financial service that has carried Earnest so far is refinancing student loans, which it began at the end of January. It is by far the largest part of the company’s business, and Earnest’s success points to the opportunity in services to ease the burden on the nation’s debt-laden students and recent graduates. Student loan debt is more than $1.2 trillion, growing by about 10 percent a year. Student loans are held by 40 million Americans. Earnest is focusing on the more indebted recent graduates. The size of its average refinancing loan is $70,000. The start-up says the average saving, on its refinanced loans, is $18,000, typically over 10 years. Other online lenders, like SoFi and CommonBond, have also done well in the market for refinancing student loans. But Earnest says its approach is particularly data-intensive, which it says allows it to tailor rates to individual circumstances. It asks its customers for digital links to their bank, credit card and retirement and investment accounts, and information on all their loans. “They are willing to share their data for a better consumer finance experience,” Mr. Beryl said. Earnest says it has read-only access to the information. It pledges not to store personal data or sell it. Earnest has made individual loans of more than $250,000. Traditional credit scoring, Mr. Beryl said, tends to punish high student debt loads. But such Earnest borrowers, he said, are in fields like brain surgery and dental surgery, where education is lengthy and costly. “These are people with great jobs, great educations and great earning potential,” he added. Earnest borrowers average a bit over 30-years-old — young people with slender credit histories and thus charged higher rates by traditional banks. Mr. Beryl said Earnest has had no delinquency problems on its student refinancing loans. And Mr. Beryl, 34, is one of those prompt-paying customers. Having attended Princeton, Harvard Business School and Harvard‘s Kennedy School of Government, he had $100,000 in student loans at the start of the year. He has paid down some, but still holds student loan debt, he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLatest Craze for Chinese Parents: Preschool Coding Classes:\\xa0Wu Pei began teaching her 6-year-old son to code this year, thinking he’d enjoy learning a skill that might boost his future job prospects in an increasingly digitized world. Now, she runs classes in Nanjing, China, and is helping more than 100 parents introduce their children to coding. The 35-year-old former computer programmer with Foxconn Technology Group is tapping growing demand from parents intent on preparing their preschoolers for a world in which Oxford University researchers predict half the jobs in some countries may be eliminated by robots and computers. Similar classes are taking off across China. Reynold Ren has taught about 150 primary school-age children in Beijing to use Scratch, a project developed by the MIT Media Lab and Arduino, which enables users to create interactive objects such as robots. In Hong Kong, about 2,500 students have taken courses that Michelle Sun runs at her First Code Academy. “Teaching the next generation coding is something that should be elevated to a strategical national importance,” said Wang Jiulin, the Xi’an-based creator of Kidscode.cn, a website that shares free information and courses. “Even today, the majority of programmers in China can only perform very basic-level tasks and there’s huge demand for top notch coders.” \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLyft executive says on track to hit $1 billion in gross revenue:\\xa0Ride-hailing app Lyft, Uber\\'s biggest competition in the United States, expects to reach $1 billion in gross annual revenue, the company\\'s co-founder told Reuters. Hitting a $1 billion run rate suggests privately owned Lyft has increased market share in some U.S. cities, despite competition from Uber, a larger and better-financed ride-hailing app. Lyft\\'s net revenue was estimated at $130 million in 2014, according to company financial documents cited by Bloomberg. By comparison, Uber\\'s gross bookings are projected to rise to $10.84 billion this year and $26.12 billion the next, according to a presentation for potential investors seen by Reuters earlier this year. Based on those figures, Uber\\'s 2015 net revenue would be $2 billion. Lyft, founded in 2012, calculated its $1 billion run rate from its gross bookings in October, when the company made about $83 million off of 7 million rides. That did not include Halloween, Zimmer said, which will be counted in November\\'s figures and is one of the ride-hailing industry\\'s busiest nights of the year. Lyft has more than a 40 percent market share in San Francisco, its hometown, and in Austin, Texas, Zimmer said. The majority of rides in San Francisco and New York City are through the Lyft Line service, a carpool feature that brings several passengers together to share a car, Lyft co-counder and Chief Executive Logan Green said last week. However, Lyft\\'s continued growth also hinges on its ability to tap investors for money. A recent pullback in late- and mid-stage investing and the cooling IPO market are expected to make capital tougher to raise for high-priced companies.\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft sheds reputation as easy mark for hackers:\\xa0\\xa0Microsoft was once the epitome of everything wrong with security in technology. Its products were so infested with vulnerabilities that the company’s co-founder, Bill Gates, once ordered all of Microsoft engineers to stop writing new code for a month and focus on fixing the bugs in software they had already built. But in recent years, Microsoft has cleaned up its act, even impressing security specialists like Mikko Hypponen, the chief research officer for F-Secure, a Finnish security company, who used to cringe at Microsoft’s practices. “They’ve changed themselves from worst in class to the best in class,” Mr. Hypponen said. “The change is complete. They started taking security very seriously.” Microsoft estimates that it now spends more than $1 billion a year on security-related initiatives, including acquisitions. It acquired three security start-ups in the last year alone, and the number of security employees at the company increased 20 percent during that time. Soon after he became Microsoft’s chief executive in February 2014, Mr. Nadella instituted a monthly meeting with security leaders from across the company. They meet to discuss industry trends and analyze threats. He also altered how Microsoft watched the Internet for hacker attacks, an effort that had been splintered among different product groups and other divisions within the company. Microsoft now pays hackers more when they find and turn over a security hole.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",
      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\n\\nChip-Only, or Chip-And-Pin? Credit Cards Give Retailers Another Grievance Against Banks:\\xa0The employee perched on a stepstool by the checkout at Trader Joe’s in Union Square in Manhattan is like an air traffic controller: Register 6 for one customer. Register 9 for the next. The routine helps move traffic quickly through the store, where the lines can often snake around the aisles of whole grain cereal, mixed nuts and Fair Trade coffee. Trader Joe’s, like many retailers around the country, recently upgraded its payment terminals around the Oct. 1 deadline to accept debit and credit cards with a new security chip. The timing, retailers say, could not be worse. The new terminals are often slower, meaning that the long lines during the busy year-end holiday season will grow longer. The new chip cards are also at the center of a growing dispute that has pitted two of America’s most prominent industries — banking and retailing — against each other, and pulled in attorneys general and even the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the process. But the debate involves more than whether consumers will be adequately protected during a season that has been rife with security breaches: The battle could affect the long-simmering war over the billions of dollars in interchange fees that merchants pay to process credit and debit transactions. “That is the crux of the matter,” said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, a payments industry publication. “The real savings is not about fraud, the real savings is about interchange.” Last year, merchants paid about $61 billion in interchange fees, Mr. Robertson said, compared with about $30 billion in fraud losses. The fight involves new payment cards, issued over the last year, that come with a small square security chip that can help make in-person transactions more secure. Retailers complain that they have spent billions of dollars upgrading their payment terminals to accommodate a system that cuts down only on the fraud shouldered by banks, not merchants. Chip and PIN, long the standard in Europe, would help retailers verify not just the card, but the person using it. Writing to their colleagues in October, two attorneys general sounded a warning bell: The new security chip would not go far enough to make transactions safer. Credit cards needed a PIN, too. “If we continue to settle for weaker standards here, we will continue to pay the price,” wrote Sam Olens, the Republican Georgia attorney general, and George Jepsen, his Democratic counterpart in Connecticut. They urged top prosecutors in other states to sign a separate letter to Visa, MasterCard, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and other institutions, pushing them to adopt the chip-and-PIN technology. Banking groups were swift to issue their own statement, saying that merchants had been “spreading an outdated narrative.” In November, a spokesman for Mr. Olens confirmed that he had taken his name off the letter.\\n\\n\\nPandora To Buy Music Streaming Provider Rdio Assets For $75M In Cash, Rdio Files Ch.11, Will Shutter Service: That was fast: just as soon as it was reported that Pandora was in talks to buy Rdio, the two sides have confirmed that an acquisition is indeed taking place. Pandora has acquired “key assets” from Rdio for $75 million in cash, the company has just announced. But as part of it, the Rdio service as we know it is tanking: the streaming service is filing for bankruptcy. “The transaction is contingent upon Rdio seeking protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California. Upon approval of the proposed transaction by the bankruptcy court, Rdio will be winding down the Rdio-branded service in all markets,” Pandora noted in its statement. Separately, Rdio said in a blog post that it will shut down in the coming weeks. More immediately, however, Rdio will continue uninterrupted. In digital music market with constrained economics, we are likely to see yet more consolidation or outright closures. And with Rdio, there is still a chance that someone could step in right now and buy the company instead of Pandora, Rdio noted in its own statement: “While we are filing for bankruptcy, because the planned sale to Pandora is contingent on such a filing, by law Rdio is required to entertain competitive offers during the bankruptcy process that is being managed for us by Moelis & Company,” it noted. But, if Pandora’s pland does go ahead, it sounds like Pandora’s plan will be to create its own flavor of on-demand streaming to exist alongside its radio-style service. The assets it is planning to buy include technology and intellectual property. Additionally it’s taking on several members of Rdio’s team, but that will not include Anthony Bay, who is staying on with Rdio to wind down the business, Brian McAndrews confirmed on a conference call about the news today.\\n\\n\\nAmazon is the Tiger Global\\'s second-largest public stake at $1.6 billion:\\xa0Tiger Global Increased Amazon, Cut Back JD.Com in Third Quarter: Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global Management boosted its stake in Amazon.com Inc. and cut its holding in JD.Com Inc. in the third quarter, reflecting the disparate performance of the two online retailers. \\xa0Tiger Global increased its number of shares in Amazon by more than three times in the quarter, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm’s position, its second-largest U.S. stock holding, was valued at $1.64 billion at the end of September. The shares jumped 18 percent in the three-month period, extending this year’s gains. The asset manager trimmed its stake in JD.com’s American depositary receipts by about 18 percent. Even with a 24 percent decline in price for the Chinese company’s ADRs and the reduction in holdings, Tiger Global’s stake was worth $1.5 billion at the end of September, making it the firm’s third-largest disclosed position. The firm’s U.S. stock positions were valued at $8.1 billion as of Sept. 30, about 15 percent below its second-quarter level. Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in equities in the U.S. must file a Form 13F within 45 days of each quarter’s end to list those stocks as well as options and convertible bonds. The filings don’t show non-U.S. securities, holdings that aren’t publicly traded, or cash.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor Indian tech startups, \\'Winter is here… and why this is a great time to invest\\':\\xa0\\xa0The horizontal e-commerce Unicorns in India – Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon, and adding ShopClues and even a more diversified Paytm – are in a dogfight with no end in sight. It doesn’t help that Amazon keeps on growing from strength to strength and getting more aggressive. The online classified players have even bigger issues. Unlike the e-commerce Unicorns, Quikr, OLX, the real estate and car classified firms and other listing-related ones like Zomato have yet to see a serious revenue jump that matches their astounding valuation surge. They all have a serious dogfight coming with no one being particularly dominant in their segment (well Zomato is, but is revenue growth justifying valuation?). Ola and Uber? Ditto, serious dogfight with no end in sight. Ad-tech? Tough for InMobi and Pubmatic to claim resilience and justify high valuations when Facebook and Google want to eat it all. Payments? Paytm has an extraordinary franchise but is it too distracted with other possibilities? Probably the only secure privately-held Unicorn in India is MuSigma – no surprise there as it has real profits and real cash generation. All the rest of the Unicorns are work in process. For early-stage startups, good news and very bad news. The good news is that several Series A funds have lots of dry powder – Accel, Kalaari, Matrix, Nexus, SAIF, Sequoia, etc. will all continue to invest and there will be some fantastic opportunities as the extraordinary customer adoption, benefits of a hyper-connected world and improvements in broadband infrastructure will continue. This is a great time to invest, much like 2008-2011 when many Unicorns of today were created. Many investors have seen such down cycles before and they will not retreat. We also plan to continue investing at our regular rate of one to two deals per quarter. However, Series A investors have to be prepared to fund fewer deals and fund the winners more as Series B/C will not be easy to come by as the ‘hedgies’ boosting up this market and valuations are more or less gone. Indian startups are not a good ‘trade’ anymore! The really bad news is that funding will be available to only a small number of players, as investors get overly conservative. There will be mass closures or scale downs and heavy bleeding for many angel, seed and Series A investors. Capital will vanish for not only the vague and fluffy ideas but even for some good ones as they will get washed away with the tide and sink.\\n\\n\\nThe War on Campus Sexual Assault Goes Digital:\\xa0According to a recent study of 27 schools [in the United States], about one-quarter of female undergraduates and students who identified as queer or transgender said they had experienced nonconsensual sex or touching since entering college, but most of the students said they did not report it to school officials or support services. Some felt the incidents weren’t serious enough. Others said they did not think anyone would believe them or they feared negative social consequences. Some felt it would be too emotionally difficult. Now, in an effort to give students additional options — and to provide schools with more concrete data — a nonprofit software start-up in San Francisco called Sexual Health Innovations has developed an online reporting system for campus sexual violence. Students at participating colleges can use its site, called Callisto, to record details of an assault anonymously. The site saves and time-stamps those records. That allows students to decide later whether they want to formally file reports with their schools — identifying themselves by their school-issued email addresses — or download their information and take it directly to the police. The site also offers a matching system in which a user can elect to file a report with the school electronically only if someone else names the same assailant. Callisto’s hypothesis is that some college students — who already socialize, study and shop online — will be more likely initially to document a sexual assault on a third-party site than to report it to school officials on the phone or in person.\\n\\n\\nAs Bubble Deflates, A Cottage Industry Emerges Around Startup Investors Trying to Cash Out:\\xa0With Silicon Valley startups staying private longer these days, investors, company executives and rank-and-file employees are increasingly eager to cash out early. In recent weeks, growing fears of a bubble have given insiders even more incentive to sell their shares. Typically company founders try to limit such transactions, but a cottage industry has sprung up to help facilitate the sales on the quiet. Selling shares early isn’t entirely new. Before Facebook Inc. went public in 2012, a secondary market emerged that helped early employees and investors cash out to buy houses, cars or build a nest egg. A network of brokers helped facilitate the private deals, and firms such as DST Global Ltd., run by Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, were eager to amass positions in the growing social network. Many of the current crop of promising startups -- among them Palintir, Dropbox, Flipboard -- have reached or surpassed their fifth year of existence. That’s when early employees increasingly need the cash, said Mark Dempster, a partner at Founders Circle, which buys officially sanctioned secondary shares. Adding to the anxiousness among those with equity in startups is a drop in valuations for some high-profile companies. Fidelity cut the valuation of Snapchat Inc. by about 25 percent in the third quarter, BlackRock Inc. trimmed the value of storage-company Dropbox Inc. and payments company Square Inc. is seeking an IPO market capitalization that’s significantly lower than its valuation as a privately held company. There’s no shortage of eager buyers attempting to buy a stake in a hot startup. Some aspiring investors even cold call insiders asking to buy shares. organized sales clearly aren’t meeting all the demand to cash out. Many employees and investors are finding other ways to sell shares on their own. Several companies have sprouted up to help find buyers for their shares. EquityZen, based in New York, offers “forward contracts,” where an employee trades the rights to their stock in exchange for cash now. The company sends out regular e-mails offering stock in companies such as Spotify, AppDyanmics and Chartboost. The sellers “get the cash they are looking for,” said Chief Executive Officer Atish Davda said in an interview. More traditional financial institutions also are participating in the secondary market, with mutual funds, hedge funds and asset managers like BlackRock Inc. occasionally buying shares this way. Last month, Nasdaq bought Secondmarket Solutions Inc., the operator of a software platform that helps facilitate the sales of shares in private companies.\\n\\n\\nAfter Outcry, Ireland Adjusts Its Corporate Tax Draw:\\xa0While lawmakers often play down its importance, Ireland’s 12.5 percent tax rate (versus 35 percent, before deductions, in the United States) has been a mainstay in the country’s decades-long strategy to attract the world’s largest companies. With few natural and manufacturing resources, Ireland and its politicians instead have turned to one of the world’s lowest corporate tax rates as the country’s primary competitive advantage in the global economy. In recent years, other European countries have accused Ireland of acting like an unfair low-tax haven. The European Commission, for example, is investigating whether Ireland gave Apple a preferential tax deal that broke the region’s tough state-aid rules. While lawmakers and the company have repeatedly denied wrongdoing, the country is already phasing out the most controversial loopholes. Ireland has since turned to a new inducement: a low tax rate on revenue generated from patents and other intellectual property held in Ireland. Such an incentive — announced last month to be 6.25 percent, or half of the country’s corporate tax rate — could be most attractive to patent-heavy industries like technology and pharmaceuticals. But many tax experts say the benefits will be significantly smaller than many had expected, particularly for global tech giants. Because of recent changes to global agreements, Ireland must limit what type of intellectual property can be included in these low-tax structures, known locally as a “knowledge development box.” Such restrictions have been demanded by several European countries, particularly Germany, which raised concerns that Ireland and other countries would turn to such structures to unfairly bring down corporate tax rates. Under international law, Ireland and other countries like Britain and potentially the United States can offer the tax breaks only on intellectual property derived from research carried out in their national borders. Much of the research and development for technology companies is done outside Ireland. So revenue from global patents like those linked to Google’s search algorithm, many of which were developed in the United States, will not be eligible for the reduced tax. Still, for regulators who have tried to limit Ireland’s tax advantage, the restrictions placed on the country’s knowledge development box represent a victory in the global push to close unfair tax loopholes. Some companies in Ireland had lobbied for a wider definition of what type of intellectual property, especially linked to online advertising and search patents moved from other countries to Ireland, could be included in the tax mechanism. Those efforts, though, failed.\\n\\n\\nSensor and Chip Makers stand to win as automakers battle for high-tech dominance:\\xa0Automakers hope semi-autonomous features will, over time, help drivers and regulators get over fears of riding in vehicles that accelerate, steer and stop themselves, making potentially life-or-death judgments. Shorter term, car companies want these features to make driving more convenient - and cars more profitable. Ford\\'s Active Speed Limiter comes at 560 euros ($602.78), and it\\'s too soon to tell how popular it will be. Among the biggest winners for now are the companies that produce electronic sensors, cameras and software that make self-driving features possible. The growing list includes the high-tech units of traditional automotive suppliers such as Germany\\'s Continental AG, Israel\\'s Mobileye Vision Technologies, and consumer-technology giants Google, Apple, Samsung Electronics Co, Sony Corp and more. At Silicon Valley\\'s Nvidia Corp, for example, video games remain the biggest market, but automotive revenue is the fastest-growing segment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCisco quarterly forecast misses expectations, shares down 5%:\\xa0Network equipment maker Cisco forecast adjusted profit and revenue growth for the second quarter below analysts\\' estimates, citing a slowdown in order growth and weakness in its enterprise business outside the United States. Shares of Cisco, considered a bellwether for the performance of the broader network gear industry, fell 5 percent to $26.41 in extended trading on Thursday. Revenue rose 3.6 percent to $12.68 billion, while analysts were expecting $12.65 billion. Net income rose 33 percent to $2.43 billion, or 48 cents per share, in the first quarter ended October 24. Needham & Co analyst Alex Henderson attributed Cisco\\'s disappointing forecast to its exposure to emerging markets. \"It has a much higher percentage exposure to those emerging markets than most companies,\" Henderson said. Cisco is beefing up its enterprise and wireless security businesses to counter lower spending by telecom carriers, its traditional customers, and nimbler rivals who are quickly grabbing market share through their software-focused networking products. In August, Cisco teamed up with Apple to improve the performance of iPads and iPhones on its network.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber Signs Digital Mapping Deal With TomTom:\\xa0Uber, the ride-hailing service, agreed on Thursday to use digital maps provided by the Dutch technology company TomTom in its smartphone applications. The move is the latest foray into digital mapping for Uber, which had offered to buy Nokia’s mapping business for around $3 billion early this year but lost out on the deal to a consortium of German automakers. Uber, which is increasingly using digital maps to run its fast-expanding global operation, has also acquired a portion of Microsoft’s map technology and hired a number of engineers from Microsoft’s mapping team. As part of the latest deal, Uber will license TomTom’s mapping and traffic management services in the more than 300 cities where it operates. Uber did not say how much it would pay for the licensing rights. The agreement represents a lift for TomTom, which also provides the core mapping services used in Apple’s Maps app, as well as in its own mapping products. TomTom has faced stiff competition from the likes of Google Maps and Nokia’s former mapping unit, called Here, which is now owned by Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler. Both of those competitors have greater financial resources to invest in their mapping services, though analysts said the Dutch company could benefit as people who do not want to rely on Google or the German carmakers look for alternatives. That appears to be the case with Uber, which has shown increased interest in developing its own mapping operations despite maintaining close ties to Google. In February, for instance, Uber announced plans to open a research and development center in Pittsburgh, where the company said it would study autonomous cars.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook Is Now Selling Virtual Reality-Like Video Ads: Facebook will start publishing more 360-degree video content into your News Feed — and it’s also going to start including 360-degree video ads. You don’t need a virtual reality headset to watch these videos, but they simulate what it’s like to look anywhere in a scene. Facebook first launched 360-degree video in News Feed back in September — you can see how it works down below — and now it’s bringing that functionality to iOS devices and opening it up to advertisers for the first time. It’s also creating tools to make it easier for people to share 360-degree content to their profiles. It added a resource hub so people can learn more about how to upload 360-degree videos, and it’s partnering with camera manufacturers like Theta and Giroptic to add “publish to Facebook” features directly into the camera. It also poached three Microsoft researchers last month to handle this very challenge — to get people sharing more VR-like content to Facebook.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple is working on a person-to-person payments service that may give iPhone owners another reason to use their Apple Wallets.\\xa0The company is in talks with banks about the new service, which would let people use their smartphones to send money to one another as easily as they send messages, according to a person with knowledge of the conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The service, which could be ready as soon as next year, would compete with PayPal’s peer-to-peer payments app Venmo, and Square’s Square Cash. Apple started Apple Pay, a mobile payments service, in October 2014. This summer it combined payments with Passbook, an app that stored digital tickets and airline boarding passes, as the rebranded product Wallet. Apple has said that it wants a bigger slice of the payments industry. Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay, said at the company’s annual developer conference in June that Apple’s goal was “replacing the wallet.” Peer-to-peer payment services, which can foster consumer loyalty, are growing. This year, users of Facebook Messenger were offered a payment service akin to one that users of China’s popular messaging app WeChat use to send payments to friends. Google has also experimented with payments in its messaging service. Banks are trying to create peer-to-peer payment products within their own mobile banking apps using a bank-owned digital payments network called clearXchange, which covers about 80 percent of all of the banks. And Square Cash has processed more than $1 billion in money transfers since the peer-to-peer program was introduced about two years ago, according to Square’s recently filed prospectus for its initial public offering. Venmo, the money transfer app owned by PayPal and popular among younger users, processed nearly $2.4 billion in 2014. To date, few of these efforts are direct moneymakers for the companies. Square Cash and Venmo are free to use when linked to a customer’s checking account, and consumers are charged only a small fee when using a credit card. For companies like Apple and Facebook, peer-to-peer payments are a way to involve customers more deeply with their products and to encourage them to leave their wallets at home.\\n\\n\\nAmazon might export delivery model from India:\\xa0E-commerce giant Amazon.com is taking lessons learnt from its daily battles with India\\'s choked roads and cramped cities to some of its largest developed markets, exporting a model of cheaper deliveries and reduced warehousing costs. Online shopping is booming in India, where millions of consumers are newly able to access the Internet thanks to cheap smartphones. For Amazon, it is already the largest contributor of new customers outside the United States. More than two years on from its arrival in India, Amazon says it is now ready to apply some of the innovations applied here to markets including the United States, Mexico and Brazil. Britain, for example, could get a delivery service called Easy Ship, where orders are picked up by Amazon\\'s crew directly from sellers, cutting out the time and cost of sending goods to a warehouse and the need for more space. Launched in India in 2014, Easy Ship, for example, cuts out costs of storing, packing and separately shipping goods. \"This probably cuts your overall transportation cost at least by half,\" said Samuel Thomas, Amazon India\\'s director of transportation, adding that it trains sellers to provide the service, now used by 30,000, or more than 75 percent of them. Another service introduced in India in May and considered for export to other markets, Seller Flex, allows sellers to have the flexibility to store goods and ship them to customers on their own, instead of routing them through Amazon. Amazon provides technology and training to ensure goods are packed, labeled and delivered as the company would. While Amazon in developed markets may not want to tweak its model for best selling goods, analysts said, it could consider the made-in-India seller solution to cut down on warehousing and delivery costs for thousands of \"non core\" products which are offered, but infrequently bought.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter Square and DropBox, possible decline in Snapchat valuation signals trouble for unicorns:\\xa0The worth of hot technology start-ups seemed for years to go in only one direction: straight up. Now there are signs of growing unease over the dizzying valuations of some of the most richly priced private companies. The latest sign has emerged with one such favorite, Snapchat, being discounted 25 percent by one of its more recent investors, Fidelity, the mutual fund giant. Another start-up, Dropbox, the widely used file storage service, was devalued by the giant asset manager BlackRock this year. The funds’ markdowns may tap the brakes on a fast-growing market. Investors, in the hopes of getting a piece of the next Facebook or Google, have been pouring billions of dollars into young private companies. Yet the public stock market has cooled for new technology companies: witness the current effort by Square, a mobile payments company, to go public at a valuation lower than what its last private investment gave it. The moves by Fidelity and BlackRock reflect how mutual funds can create challenges for technology’s favored start-ups, just as they helped inflate valuations in the first place. Over the last few years, mutual funds fought to buy pieces of appealing venture-backed companies like Snapchat and Dropbox. The idea was that public investors wanted to own these start-ups because their value was growing faster than that of many publicly traded companies. By owning the private shares, the large mutual funds would also get to know the start-ups and be well positioned to buy their shares when they went public. As mutual fund and venture capital investors jockeyed with hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds to invest, their abundant capital pushed prices for private shares into the stratosphere. Snapchat, for example, is valued at more than $16 billion and Dropbox at around $10 billion. The biggest prize of them all, Uber, is now seeking a round of investment that would value the company at $60 billion to $70 billion. Uber’s success with that round would be a further test of investors’ appetite. The competition among investors also helped create a herd of dozens of “unicorns,” a term for private companies valued above $1 billion, coined when such a phenomenon was still considered rare. Yet unlike venture capital firms, mutual funds are legally obligated to value each of their portfolio holdings every day, including hard-to-value assets like shares in private companies, and they must report these values at least every half year. A spokesman for the Investment Company Institute, one of the largest mutual fund associations, said that the process was a “good faith determination” of what an owner could get in a sale of the asset.\\n\\n\\n\\nHands-On With Facebook Notify, A Push Notification News App And Twitter Alternative:\\xa0\\xa0Facebook released Notify, an app for reading customizable breaking news, info, and entertainment push notifications right on your lock screen. Notify lets you select from over 70 publishers and customize your alerts to only send you news about specific companies, cities, sports teams, music genres and more. Each is sent as a push notification and shown in the Notify app’s feed for 24 hours, and can be clicked through to read an associated link. Today Notify becomes available on iOS in the US. It doesn’t offer the real-time discussion and independent voices of Twitter, but could provide an alternative for Twitter lurkers who just wanted real-time information and aren’t interested in building another audience to broadcast to. Though Notify won’t feature any ads for now, there are certainly opportunities to offer sponsored suggestions for accounts to follow. As long as Facebook can get enough of its 1.55 billion users on Notify to justify the work publishers are putting in to produce content there, it could create the real-time, urgent, high-signal information channel the News Feed could never be. I spent some time with the Notify team and played with the app myself, and here are my hands-on thoughts. What’s really special about Notify is the granularity of alerts you can get. While general Twitter accounts feature a broad range of content that might not all be interesting to you, Notify lets you subscribe only to the very specific sub-topics that are relevant. Facebook has worked with 70 launch partners to create Notify stations, including The New York Times, CNN, Huffington Post, Vanity Fair, Techmeme, Fox Sports, Epicurious, Comedy Central, Fandango, BandsInTown and The Weather Channel. Many offer both general news stations and ones with options to follow specific sub-topics. Tapping a station lets you preview its content by showing the last 20 notifications it sent. Publishers use a special interface to write notification text, select a link, and then publish or schedule their alerts. There’s also an API for programmatic distribution of weather forecasts, sports scores and other structured data. Working out these partnerships is what led to the leaks about Notify this summer from The Awl and Financial Times.\\nAlibaba Sites Sold More Than $14 Billion of Goods in a Single Day:\\xa0Alibaba’s consumer shopping sites sold more than $14.3 billion of products on its biggest shopping day of the year, called Singles Day, marking around a 57 percent increase over last year’s total. The total for the last 24 hours, to be precise, was $14,341,847,366.00, according to a spokesman. To give you a sense of how big this sale is, the $14.3 billion figure is just 27 percent less than the $19.6 billion worth of goods that eBay sellers sold in July, August and September combined. The number also dwarfs the $2 billion Americans spent on Cyber Monday desktop shopping in 2014.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a Mobile Website Like an App, Flipkart Takes a Swipe at Apple:\\xa0India’s e-commerce start-up Flipkart has worked with Google to make a new mobile website that could eliminate the need for apps, in a move that takes a swipe at Apple’s grip on the mobile experience.\\xa0On Monday, Flipkart unveiled the website, which it created with the Google team that focuses on the mobile web browser Chrome. The two made a site that supports push notifications, the ability to search for and read information while offline, location-based data and access to hardware features like a smartphone’s camera. While such features have long been available in apps that people download to their phones, they typically have not been prevalent on mobile websites.\\xa0Flipkart plans to show other companies what it took to build the website — including the hurdles it had to overcome and the weaknesses it found — at Google’s Chrome Developers Conference this month. Google’s parent company is Alphabet.\\n\\n\\nMatch Is Seeking $3.1 Billion Value in I.P.O.:\\xa0The Match Group is seeking a valuation of about $3.1 billion as it prepares for an initial public offering.\\xa0The company, which owns the online dating brands OkCupid and Tinder, said on Monday that it planned to sell 33.3 million shares for $12 to $14 apiece. Those terms indicate an offering size of $433 million and a market valuation of $3.1 billion at the midpoint.\\xa0In setting these terms, Match begins a roadshow, meeting with investors who will help the company set an official I.P.O. price in a few weeks, based on demand.\\xa0The media conglomerate that owns Match, IAC/InterActiveCorp, whose chairman is Barry Diller, has been acquiring a number of dating sites over the last few years. As the online-dating industry increased in popularity, legacy sites like Match.com started facing more competition from free models like OkCupid. Mr. Diller’s strategy was to build scale by acquiring a portfolio of brands – now 45 in all – and eventually spin them off under the Match umbrella.\\n\\n\\nGoogle Offers Free Software in Bid to Gain an Edge in Machine Learning:\\xa0A race is underway toward the future of computer technology with advances in a branch of artificial intelligence known as machine learning. Machine-learning software is trained to handle vast amounts of data, and then learns as it goes, often on its own.\\xa0Machine learning has been around for a long time, and it has been a crucial technology in the success of Internet giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook — used in the development of search, ad targeting and product recommendations. But in the last few years, machine learning has made huge improvements in computer vision, language translation and speech recognition, largely by applying the techniques of deep learning, which is inspired by theories about how the brain recognizes patterns.\\xa0Every major technology company is investing aggressively in artificial intelligence and machine learning. And not just computer companies. Last Friday, Toyota announced it would spend $1 billion for research and development on artificial intelligence in the United States over the next five years.\\xa0Google announced on Monday a bold step to establish its leadership in the field of machine learning, accelerate the pace of innovation in the field and potentially strengthen its business. It is making the software of its new machine-learning system, TensorFlow, which was developed over years, open-source code. The software will be freely available for outside programmers to use and modify.\\n\\n\\nHow Pinterest Got the Full Attention of Ad Agency Execs:\\xa0Better features for marketers and consumers: Pinterest is getting serious about becoming a formidable digital advertising player, and agency executives are taking notice.\\xa0\"What Pinterest has accomplished in the last nine months is the most evolution of any platform,\" said Chris Tuff, evp and director of business development and partnerships at 22Squared. For comparison, Tuff said it took Facebook four and a half years to build the same kind of sophisticated ad tools that Pinterest is pitching.\\xa0On Monday, the site launched a search feature that uses photos to comb through millions of product images. For example, someone looking at a picture of a table can zero in on finding similar tables by tapping on the Pin to start a search result without typing a word. Up until now, people have only been able to search on Pinterest with text queries.\\xa0Marketers won\\'t be able to buy visual search ads like they\\'ve been able to with text search ads, which debuted in early 2014. Pinterest hasn\\'t said whether visual search ads were part of its future plans, but that scenario seems likely. The visual-search move should prove popular to users—which will help maintain marketers\\' attention for the Pinterest ad products that currently exist. In January, Pinterest opened its Promoted Pins advertising business to all U.S. advertisers. Then in May, the San Francisco-based company started offering more targeting and video promos.\\n\\n\\nRackspace Announces Better-Than-Expected Q3 Results, Including Revenue of $509M, Plans $350M Debt Offering:\\xa0Following the bell, Rackspace announced its third-quarter financial results, including revenue of $509 million and earnings per share of $0.26.\\xa0The market had expected Rackspace to report $0.20 in per-share profit off revenue of $503.08 million. Down nearly four points in regular trading, the company has swayed both positive and negative following its earnings announcement; investors, it seems, are not entirely sure at the moment how to parse the results.\\xa0The company’s top line expansion clocked in at 10.7 percent, compared to the year-ago quarter.\\xa0On the product side of things, Rackspace recently announced, and I’ll quote here to avoid butchering the truth, “Carina, A Hosted Environment For Running Docker Containers.” It has been rumored that Rackspace could entertain the possibility of going Full Dell, and heading private.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSquare Takes an IPO Bullet for All of the Overpriced Unicorns:\\xa0Square announced plans on Friday morning to price its IPO at $11 to $13 a share, meaning an IPO in that range would value the company at much less than the valuation it secured in its last round of private financing.\\xa0If the company prices at $13, Square would carry a value of about $4.2 billion based on the approximately 323 million shares it says will be outstanding. Square, Jack Dorsey’s payments company, was valued by private investors at about $6 billion in its last round of private financing, according to insiders.\\xa0To be sure, Square’s bankers could increase the price range before the IPO if they get feedback from investors that demand is higher than expected. But the range would have to jump a fair bit to even match what Square thought it was worth in its last round of funding.\\n\\n\\nVerizon Says Time Is Right for Kids to Get Smartwatches:\\xa0While smartwatches have yet to really become a hit for adults, LG and Verizon say the time is right to strap them onto little kids.\\xa0Verizon has started selling two new GPS-connected wearables that allow parents and kids to stay in contact and also to alert parents when their children leave a predefined area.The $125 GizmoGadget aims to mimic the look of adult smartwatches and has a touchscreen interface, apps and a choice of different themes and watch faces. It also features a pedometer and the ability for kids and parents to exchange text messages with emojis, voice clips or preset messages. GizmoGadget allows kids to call one of nine preset phone numbers.\\xa0The more basic GizmoPal 2, which sells for $55, has LED lights to alert kids when a caregiver is calling.\\n\\n\\nNYT VR: How to Experience a New Form of Storytelling From The Times:\\xa0Today, The New York Times takes a step into virtual reality. NYT VR is a mobile app that can be used — along with your headphones and optionally a cardboard viewing device — to simulate richly immersive scenes from across the globe.\\xa0To start, The Times Magazine presents three portraits of children driven from their homes by war and persecution — an 11-year-old boy from eastern Ukraine named Oleg, a 12-year-old Syrian girl named Hana and a 9-year-old South Sudanese boy named Chuol. “This new filmmaking technology enables an uncanny feeling of connection with people whose lives are far from our own,” writes Jake Silverstein, editor of the magazine.\\n\\n\\nWhy There\\'s Still a Market for Online Ads No One Sees:\\xa0Earlier this week the ad tech company AppNexus announced what it described as a major innovation: It would allow advertisers to pay only for those digital ads that are actually seen by people. To those uninitiated in the ways of programmatic advertising, this might seem like table stakes. Given all the talk about sophisticated tracking and targeting associated with digital ads, finding out which ones get viewed should be simple. But most industry studies estimate that only about half of digital ads are seen by real people. \\xa0AppNexus is not the only company trying to change that. Last month Google said advertisers using the Google Display Network wouldn’t be charged if their ads weren’t seen by people, and this week it began allowing third-party auditors to double-check Google’s own claims about the viewability of ads on YouTube. Facebook recently made a similar move. With the ad tech companies getting in line, it would seem the days of paying for digital ads no one sees are almost over.\\n\\n\\nGoogle Acquires Fly Labs To Join Its Google Photos Team:\\xa0Today, Google acquired Fly Labs to join its Google Photos team. The company aimed to help people edit videos and photos and it sported 3 million downloads over the past 18 months.

You’ll still be able to use them, but there will be no more updates.\\n\\n\\nIndian startups cut jobs as funding slows down:\\xa0“I don’t know what is going to happen now,” said Ankit Agarwal (name changed), a TinyOwl sales person who was sacked last week. His words summarise the predicament of around 1,700 persons who lost jobs in the Indian startups in the last three months. “We got a mail on Tuesday saying there will be a meeting to discuss future plans. We first thought it had something to do with our half-yearly appraisals,” Ankit explained how he and 24 others at TinyOwl’s Pune office lost jobs. He did not want to reveal his real name, fearing it would affect his future job prospects.\\xa0After much publicised 36-hour drama involving gherao of a co-founder, police intervention and local politicians’ entry into the startup’s premises, the sacked employees managed to get their full and final settlement that 15 of their colleagues who were fired in the previous month have not got yet. However, all of them will have an uncertain Diwali since their frantic job searches are met with stoic ‘we-will-get-back-to-you’ responses.\\xa0The actual number of job cuts could be even higher than the estimated 1700 lay-offs across well-known internet startups such as Housing, Zomato, TinyOwl and LocalBanya, as many such cases go unreported. Firings and shutdowns happen rather routinely among many 50-100 employee startups.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy Health Care Start-Ups Like Theranos Need Investing Expertise:\\xa0The Silicon Valley start-ups that often grab headlines are typically in the Internet and consumer technology world. But there’s another part of start-up land that is also highly active: health-related technology, which includes biotech, health care services and medical devices.\\xa0Venture capitalists have been pouring money into health-related start-ups, with funding jumping 34 percent to $9.4 billion in 2014 from a year earlier, according to the National Venture Capital Association. What’s often left unsaid about these companies is that they behave very differently from the typical consumer start-up or business software company.\\xa0The health-related start-up sector has produced fewer unicorns, which are the private companies with $1 billion-plus valuations, largely because it takes a long time to develop new medical tests, drugs or insurance systems. Regulators often weigh in. Even if an idea behind a start-up is truly great, it’s bound to fail if the science doesn’t work out, if the regulators don’t like what they see, or if insurers and the government won’t pay for the product.\\n\\n\\nThe High Price of Delivery App Convenience:\\xa0When Emily Yang, a San Francisco tech worker, is running out of cat food, she taps an app called Instacart to order a new bag of kibble to be delivered to her door within hours. For dinner, she often orders through Sprig and Munchery, app-powered services that bring fresh organic meals to her home.\\xa0Her experience highlights how a proliferation of instant-delivery apps has turned the smartphone into a sort of magic remote control that can almost beam items straight to your door: a burrito, a tennis racket, even a week’s worth of groceries. There are now so many of these apps, especially serving cities like San Francisco and New York, that you can tap an app even to do your laundry or mail packages.\\xa0But instant gratification has a price. With the delivery apps, tech companies act as a middleman connecting merchants and couriers with customers, and they pass the service charges on to the consumer. The fees are also more obfuscated and complex than you might expect when you, say, order a pizza. The receipt for the pie would clearly state its cost and the delivery fee.\\n\\n\\nPeople doing ‘crazy things’ with Tesla’s autopilot are spoiling it for everybody:\\xa0Tesla chief executive Elon Musk is warning that some new limits may be coming to the company\\'s autopilot feature because of \"some fairly crazy videos on YouTube\" showing drivers behaving dangerously while the car is in control.\\xa0Tesla doesn\\'t recommend taking your hands off the wheel while the car is in autopilot mode. Yet that\\'s exactly what some people are doing, leading to things like near-misses with other vehicles:Even the New York Times\\' video review made a big deal out of being able to drive hands-free.\\xa0\"This is not good,\" Musk said on an earnings call this week. \"We\\'ll put on some constraints on autopilot to minimize people doing crazy things with it.\"\\xa0Musk didn\\'t elaborate on what kinds of new restrictions autopilot users could soon face, though it\\'s likely that they would show up in the form of another software update.\\n\\n\\nIn a first, the FCC is fining a major cable company for getting hacked:\\xa0In the first such case against a U.S. cable company, federal regulators are slapping Cox Communications with a $595,000 fine after Cox allowed hackers from Lizard Squad to penetrate its systems and steal private customer information.\\xa0By posing as an IT administrator and tricking a couple of Cox employees into giving up their login credentials, a hacker known as \"EvilJordie\" broke into Cox\\'s databases and gained access to customer names, addresses, password recovery information and even \"partial\" Social Security numbers and driver\\'s license numbers, according to the Federal Communications Commission. They also got hold of some customers\\' telephone records.\\xa0As many as 61 current or former Cox customers were affected by the breach, which occurred between Aug. 7 and Aug. 14 of 2014. The hackers changed 28 of these customers\\' passwords, locking them out of their own accounts, and posted eight people\\'s personal information on social media.\\n\\n\\nYouTube to support virtual reality video on its app:\\xa0The Youtube app now supports VR video - a format that gives viewers what the company says are more realistic 360-degree perspectives of films.\\xa0To view it, a user would call up a virtual reality video on the YouTube app, click a button on the video for VR mode, and place the phone in Alphabet Inc\\'s \"Cardboard\" device, a handheld gadget made from the standard box material that creates a VR viewing experience.\\xa0Makers of virtual reality content can upload VR videos compatible with the Cardboard viewer directly to YouTube. YouTube said there are about a dozen VR videos, including one stemming from the \"Hunger Games\" movies.\\n\\n\\nAdd a Fund to Amazon Cart? You Have Indian Regulator\\'s Support:\\xa0Indians are estimated to spend about $9 billion this year shopping online for everything from smartphones to cupcakes. The nation’s stock market regulator wants them to add another product to their shopping cart: mutual funds.\\xa0The Securities & Exchange Board of India plans to change its regulations to allow online marketplaces such as Flipkart Online Services Pvt. and Amazon.com Inc. to offer funds alongside other products, Chairman U.K. Sinha said in an interview at his office in Mumbai.\\xa0Mutual funds have gained popularity among Indian savers, receiving more money in the past 17 months than they did in the preceding 12 years. Yet just 3 percent of the nation’s 1.2 billion people invest in them, with majority preferring bank deposits or gold, according to the Association of Mutual Funds in India. Allowing e-commerce sites to sell funds will help money managers reach out to young investors accustomed to shopping online, providing the industry with a new distribution channel, Sinha said.\\n\\n\\nIn India, Tiny Owl Founder Reportedly Detained for Two Days By Laid-Off Employees — and the Police:\\xa0Well that was strange — and scary. Hours ago, one of six cofounders of Tiny Owl, a two-year-old, Mumbai, India-based food ordering software startup, was released after being held captive for two days by disgruntled former employees at the company’s office in Pune. Tiny Owl had earlier this week announced $7.67 million in fresh funding from earlier backers Matrix Partners and Sequoia Capital. But the funding came with the understanding that Tiny Owl would follow through on a major restructuring to control its burn rate.As part of that restructuring plan, the company is shutting down its operations in four cities, including Pune. Which leads us to what happened to company cofounder Gaurav Choudhary.\\xa0Choudhary had traveled to Pune earlier this week to oversee the office’s closure, while his fellow cofounders – all of whom are graduates of IIT Bombay — traveled to sites in Gurgaon, Chennai and Hyderabad to do the same.\\xa0But according to various media accounts, soon after Choudhary informed Tiny Owl’s Pune-based employees of the layoffs, he was asked to pay them immediately. When he said he couldn’t, they reportedly refused to let him leave the building and return to Mumbai.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

And Facebook is spending a lot of dollars to do just that.\\xa0The social media giant on Wednesday posted another quarter of robust revenue growth — up 41 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, to $4.5 billion — fueled by its mobile advertising business and an increase in daily users. Net profit rose to $896 million, up 11 percent from a year ago.\\xa0The revenue and profit increases came alongside a surge in spending. Facebook’s expenses totaled more than $3 billion in the third quarter, a 62 percent leap from a year earlier, meaning that spending growth is outpacing sales growth. The company, based in Menlo Park, Calif., emphasized that it had no intention of slowing that down as it invested heavily in hiring, marketing, new technologies and other initiatives.\\n\\n\\nAirbnb and Uber Mobilize Vast User Base to Sway Policy:\\xa0Over the last few years, so-called sharing companies like Airbnb and Uber — online platforms that allow strangers to pay one another for a room or a ride — have established footholds in thousands of communities well before local regulators have figured out how to deal with them.\\xa0Now, as cities grapple with the growth of these services and try to pass rules for how they should operate, the companies are fighting back by turning their users into a vast political operation that can be mobilized at any sign of a threat.\\xa0Airbnb offered the latest and most vociferous example of this on Wednesday. Fresh off defeating a San Francisco measure that would have severely curtailed the company’s business in its hometown, Airbnb staged a news conference that functioned as a warning shot to other cities thinking about proposing new regulations.\\xa0The event was billed as a debriefing to discuss the defeat of Proposition F, which would have toughened existing rules for the service by, among other things, cutting the number of nights people could rent out rooms in their homes.\\xa0In this city of about 840,000 people, roughly $8 million was raised by groups opposed to Proposition F — about eight times the amount raised by the proposition’s backers, according to records filed with the San Francisco Ethics Commission. Airbnb is preparing for more fights. Mr. Lehane said the company was working to organize voting blocs in other cities where it operates. By the end of next year, he said, the company has a goal of creating 100 “clubs” made up of Airbnb home-sharers — sort of like local unions.\\xa0Companies like Airbnb and Uber have become multibillion-dollar companies by employing a kind of guerrilla growth strategy in which they set up a modest team of workers in a city and immediately start providing their services to the public, whether local laws allow them to or not.\\n\\n\\nJet.com to Raise Funds Valuing the Amazon Rival at $1.5 Billion:\\xa0Jet.com, the much-hyped Amazon.com competitor, is close to raising $500 million to $550 million in a funding round led by Fidelity Investments, according to a person familiar with the plans. The investment would give the year-old online shopping startup a valuation of at least $1.5 billion, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the deal isn\\'t finalized.\\xa0Founded by a former Amazon executive, Jet is aggressively trying to undercut its chief rival’s prices and attract customers quickly. To achieve that goal, it had raised $220 million before selling a single product and abandoned its subscription membership fee a few months after opening its doors in July.\\xa0Jet is attracting a loyal following by offering customers unique ways to save on orders, including discounts for paying with a debit card or waiving their right to return products they buy, said Scot Wingo, chairman of ChannelAdvisor. Customers can also amass savings by loading up their carts with more items, which minimizes the number of shipments.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba, Baidu Turn `Kingmakers\\' as China Sees Dealmaking Surge:\\xa0To understand why China is in the midst of a surge in dealmaking and why that won’t slow down anytime soon, consider the arranged marriage of two of the country’s largest travel websites. Qunar Cayman Islands Ltd. and Ctrip.com International Ltd. were bitter rivals for years, bickering in public and sacrificing profits to grab customers in the growing China market. Then Qunar’s largest shareholder, Baidu Inc., forced it into a deal that gave Ctrip control over the combined entity, according to a person familiar with the matter. Qunar’s management learned their fate only two days before the announcement, the person said. China’s Internet market, after a surge in startups and record venture-capital investments, is entering a new phase of consolidation as investors grow weary of money-losing battles for customers and push for profitability. Acquisitions by Chinese companies rose 75 percent this year to $413.2 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, with domestic deals in the Internet industry nearly quadrupling to $55.6 billion.\\n\\n\\nFacebook Hits 8 Billion Daily Video Views, Doubling From 4 Billion In April:\\xa0Facebook video viewership is growing by leaps and bounds. It now sees 8 billion average daily video views from 500 million users. That’s up from just 4 billion video views per day in April. Mark Zuckerberg made the announcement on the call to investors followingFacebook’s blockbuster Q3 2015 earnings report.\\xa0Some might contend that this stat isn’t totally accurate since Facebook counts just 3 seconds of watching as a “view”. But the 100% growth in seven months shows that even when controlling for this limitation of the metric, users are still voraciously consuming videos.\\xa0Even at just 3 seconds per view, Facebook is generating 760 years of watch time each day. That means there’s a ton of space for Facebook to lure in TV commercial dollars that are shifting to digital. It also has an opportunity to grow viewership\\xa0further with an ongoing test where it pays a revenue share to top video creators.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGmail’s Inbox app will now write (some of) your e-mails for you:\\xa0Google just gave a little bit of help to anyone tired of typing out the same reply to e-mails over and over again. Now, software will do some of the work for you.\\xa0An updated version of Inbox, one of Google\\'s mail apps, will \"read\" your e-mails and offer up suggested replies. In a company blog post, Gmail software engineer Bálint Miklós said Tuesday that the feature \"uses machine learning to recognize emails that need responses and to generate the natural language responses on the fly.\" The goal is to have options good enough that a user will send short messages in just two taps. And the suggestions are designed to get better as you use the feature more often, and Inbox learns your personal quirks.\\n\\n\\nTesla’s autopilot will soon become an ‘in-app purchase,’ Elon Musk says:\\xa0Tesla owners will soon be able to add autopilot functionality to their vehicles if they weren\\'t able to sign up for it earlier, company chief executive Elon Musk said Tuesday.\\xa0Drivers will be allowed to unlock Tesla\\'s autopilot with a $3,000 payment, Musk told investors. That\\'s about $500 more than what early adopters paid for autopilot\\'s most powerful capabilities.\\xa0\"That\\'s something we\\'ll be allowing people to do at some point in the coming months,\" said Musk. \"Sort of like an in-app purchase, I guess.\"\\xa0All Tesla vehicles already benefit from some autopilot safety features, thanks to a recent software update. Automatic emergency braking, collision avoidance and collision warning have now rolled out across the fleet, Musk said. But only about 40,000 Teslas have autopilot enabled, he added. Those vehicles are collectively logging a million miles of driverless driving a day, giving Tesla valuable usage data.\\xa0The decision by Tesla to allow \"in-app purchases\" of a sort highlights the company\\'s growing habit of using software to upgrade its vehicles, equipping them with new powers on a rapid update cycle.\\n\\n\\nUber\\'s China Rival Says Cash Burn Has Slowed With Lower Payouts:\\xa0Didi Kuaidi, the ride-hailing service competing in China with Uber Technologies Inc., said it has slashed the subsidies it pays out to drivers and riders since the middle of this year, reducing its cash burn as the rising number of orders reduce the need for enticements.\\xa0The level of financial incentives last month were about a third of the level in June and July, Stephen Zhu, vice president of strategy and head of taxi services at Didi Kuaidi, said in an interview in Beijing on Tuesday. Some of its services like taxi-hailing are close to breaking even, he said. The decline in subsidies comes as the transport ministry released draft guidelines that prohibit Internet ride-booking companies to offer their services below cost in order to gain market share, describing such tactics as disruptive to “normal market order.” The proposed regulations also codify requirements that vehicles used in hailing services must be registered for commercial use and that drivers have to obtain qualifications before being allowed to ferry fares.\\n\\n\\nAmazon Opens Its First-Ever Physical Store, Selling Books on Paper, With a Side of Irony:\\xa0Amazon, bookstore slayer, meet Amazon, bookstore owner.\\xa0The e-commerce giant known in many circles as the archenemy of brick-and-mortar stores — and bookstores, specifically — plans to open its first physical storefront in its history on Tuesday. The store’s name? Amazon Books. Yes, Amazon is opening a bookstore in its hometown of Seattle.\\xa0In an interview with the Seattle Times, Amazon said that the physical store would use online customer reviews and other digital data to inform some of its inventory decisions. Amazon will display a review or rating for each of the 5,000 or so books on display. Prices will match those on Amazon.com.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSnapchat’s new Terms of Service freaked people out because no one reads them:\\xa0Snapchat updated its Terms of Service last week, and the Internet freaked out a little bit. Some users interpreted changes to mean the company could now hang on to users\\' private messages, broadcast them publicly and sell them to third parties. The pushback grew so loud that Snapchat took to its blog Sunday to explain itself, saying that private Snaps and Chats are still automatically deleted from its servers once viewed or expired. But, Snapchat said, its new Terms of Service granted the company \"broad license\" to user content. The company said those clauses are meant to apply to images and videos users share publicly for its \"Live Stories\" feature, which may be syndicated across other platforms. The new policy was also expanded to account for its Replay feature, which charges users who want to rewatch videos more than once, the blog post said.\\n\\n\\nInstagram is jumping into the curation business, too:\\xa0Over the weekend, Instagram took a page from the playbook of social media competitors and made a curated stream, based around Halloween videos, that pulled together clips submitted by its users. As Twitter and Snapchat have done before it, Instagram used the stream to highlight unique content on its network that users may not catch if they were just scrolling through their own apps. The trend toward curation makes quite a bit of sense. Sure, part of the fun of being on a real-time social network is being able to jump into the stream at any time and get plugged in to whatever\\'s happening at that moment. But that can be overwhelming for new users, and even more experienced ones who want to zero in on a particular topic. On days such as Halloween — where everyone is posting similar videos for comparison — it seems like a smart thing to do to briefly bring the whole network together.\\n\\n\\nDell eyes $10 billion asset sales ahead of EMC merger:\\xa0Dell Inc is preparing to sell around $10 billion in non-core assets, including software and services, to reduce the heavy debt load it will be taking on to buy EMC Corp (EMC.N), according to people familiar with the matter.\\xa0Dell, which will assume $49.5 billion of debt once the merger with EMC is completed, has communicated the plan to credit rating agencies in recent days, the people said on Monday.\\xa0Assets Dell could sell include Quest Software, which helps with information technology (IT) management; SonicWall, an e-mail encryption and data security provider; back-up solutions unit AppAssure; as well as IT services provider Perot Systems, the people said.\\xa0The divestitures will not include Dell\\'s hardware assets such as servers, which are crucial in its quest to dominate the large enterprise market through its merger with EMC, as well as compete more effectively with the likes of Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) and International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), the people added.\\n\\n\\nFitbit Crushes Expectations In Q3, But A Follow-On Equity Offering Drags Its Shares Down: Following the bell, Fitbit announced its third-quarter financial performance, including revenue of $409.3 million, and earnings per share using normal accounting methods of $0.19. The company’s adjusted profit totaled $0.24 per share.\\xa0The results are notably strong. Investors had expected the company to report a far-slimmer $0.10 adjusted per-share profit off of revenue of just $350.97. Shares in the company, however, are sharply lower in after-hours trading, off nearly 9 percent as of the time of writing.\\xa0What is going on? Despite a smashing quarter, Fitbit’s equity is getting whacked by what, so far as TechCrunch can tell at current tip, is planned liquidity for current shareholders, a newly announced follow-on offering, and legal friction.\\xa0Starting with the legal point, Jawbone and Fitbit have a legal back and forth going, with the latest news being a counterclaim filed by the former. Fitbit has a pending patent infringement case on the books, but Jawbone has denied all allegations…using the fun word “frivolous.”\\n\\n\\nGoogle Says Chromebooks and Chrome Operating Systems Aren’t Going Away:\\xa0Rumors of the demise of the Chrome operating system have not just been exaggerated but are simply untrue, Google said on Monday in a rare public response to an earlier report.\\xa0A report on Thursday in the Wall Street Journal claimed Google is preparing to merge its Chrome OS, which powers the Web-centric Chromebook laptops, with its mobile OS Android. After the story landed, Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google’s SVP who runs both Android and Chrome, pushed back on it, tweeting that the company is “very committed” to the desktop operating system.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMeg Whitman Seeks Reinvention for HP as It Prepares for Split:\\xa0When HP splits in two on Sunday after a year of planning, what is left will bear little resemblance to the engineering-driven company founded more than 75 years ago in a garage not far from Stanford University.\\xa0On one side will be HP Inc., which will largely consist of personal computers and printers. On the other, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, or HPE, which will sell the computer servers, data storage, networking, software and consulting services that run a modern company. Each company is expected to have annual revenue of about $50 billion and will be among America’s 500 largest public companies.\\xa0Neither will have the standing as one of the most innovative operations in the world that the old HP enjoyed for decades.\\n\\n\\nWith Instagram’s Boomerang, making gifs is easier than ever:\\xa0It’s a gif world, and we’re just living in it. Those short, looping (often loopy) animated files pop up just about everywhere on the Web and in social media. Now, it’s easier than ever to make them yourself. Instagram’s new app, Boomerang, makes it very easy to make your own 1-second gifs for sharing on Instagram, Facebook and your phone’s camera roll.\\xa0The process couldn’t be simpler. Just find something moving that you want to shoot, hit the capture button and keep as still as you can for a second or so. You can shoot from either rear-facing or front-facing camera. To work, the app will need permission to access those cameras, as well as your phone’s storage. Free, for iOS and Android.\\n\\n\\nUber Germany retreats to Berlin, Munich:\\xa0Taxi-hailing service Uber Technologies is making a retreat in Germany to the cities of Berlin and Munich as it grapples with a ban from using unlicensed cab drivers.\\xa0Uber will for now suspend services in Hamburg, Frankfurt and Duesseldorf, it said in a statement on Friday, citing a difficult regulatory environment.\\xa0A German court in March banned Uber from running services using unlicensed cab drivers and set stiff fines for any violations of local transport laws by the pioneering online taxi firm.\\xa0The company in Germany has since limited itself to drivers that hold a passenger transport license, among other legal requirements, through its UberX and UberBlack smartphone apps, but it has run into a shortage of suppliers of ride services.\\n\\n\\nZomato CEO warns may not meet revenue goal, pulls up sales team:\\xa0Zomato, the restaurant listing and services company which is valued around $1 billion, might fail to meet its sales target for the current financial year, according to an email co-founder and CEO Deepinder Goyal sent to the staff on Friday.\\xa0In a long mail that Goyal first sent to the company’s sales team and later forwarded to all employees, he talked about the underperformance of the sales team and how it might result in the company missing its revenue targets.\\xa0“We are far behind the numbers that we promised our investors for this financial year (year ending March 2016) – our investors have said that so far, we have always delivered what we have promised. We are close to not living up to that for the first time in the last 5 years,” Goyal said in the email.\\xa0The email came a fortnight after the company sacked about 300 employees globally, or 10 per cent of its total workforce. Zomato has also been facing difficulties in retaining top-level staff as a number of senior executives have left the company after short stints.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlphabet Edges Toward Settling the Android or Chrome Question:\\xa0For years, Google, now known as Alphabet, has supported two operating systems on two very different tracks: Android and Chrome. But now the company is nodding in the direction of Android. Google is working toward allowing its low-cost Chromebook computing devices to work on the popular Android operating system. The work will take place over the next year, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Google is not indicating it plans to stop development of Chrome OS, but making Android work on Chromebooks opens the door to one of the few products that Chrome OS, the lesser-known operating system, had to itself. Chrome OS should not be confused with Google’s popular Chrome web browser. The first Android operating system for mobile devices was introduced about seven years ago as a direct competitor to Apple’s iOS mobile operating system. Since then, it has become the most widely used operating system in the world. Its development was led by an executive named Andy Rubin, who went on to lead much of the company’s robotics efforts before leaving Google last year. Google introduced Chrome OS about a year later, surprising some who wondered why the company needed two operating systems. Interestingly, its early development was led by Sundar Pichai, who is now the chief executive of the part of Alphabet that is still called Google. Chrome OS has gained a following in academia but very few other places. According to IDC, a market research firm, about 3.9 million Chromebooks were shipped to the American education sector last year. If Google should drop the Chrome OS, it will follow in the footsteps of Microsoft. The latest version of Microsoft’s flagship Windows operating system is meant to run on both PCs and mobile devices. Apple still supports separate operating systems for mobile devices and PCs.\\n\\n\\nAmazon Launches ‘Pay With Amazon’ Buttons for Mobile Apps:\\xa0Amazon says it is finally ready to turn its huge customer base into a big payments business outside of Amazon. For real this time. The e-commerce giant is bringing its “Pay with Amazon” buttons to mobile apps, while “tripling down” on placing its Pay with Amazon buttons on websites in overseas markets like Japan. The moves are the latest in the company’s on-again, off-again efforts to take advantage of the more than 200 million customer accounts it has on file by processing payments on websites outside of its own walls. Earlier this year, Amazon hired PayPal vet Patrick Gauthier to lead a newly created team dedicated solely to building a payments business across the Web and app world. The payments industry is watching closely. For years, it has been waiting for Amazon to become a real player, perhaps challenging PayPal along the way.\\n\\n\\nBaidu’s Profit Tops Estimates Even as Spending Rises - Revenue up 36%, Shares pop 7%:\\xa0Baidu Inc. kept spending under enough control to report a third-quarter profit that topped projections, giving the Chinese Internet search provider more room to boost a share buyback program to $2 billion. Revenue climbed 36 percent to 18.4 billion yuan ($2.89 billion), matching estimates. The board authorized a new block of share repurchases, after completing a $1 billion buyback program in the latest quarter, the Beijing-based company said in statement Friday. Chairman and Founder Robin Li is betting new services including home delivery and online video will drive growth beyond the company’s mainstay search advertising business. Baidu said this week its Qunar travel site will form an alliance and swap shares with rival Ctrip.com, the latest move toward consolidation in China’s Internet industry. Baidu Inc. kept spending under enough control to report a third-quarter profit that topped projections, giving the Chinese Internet search provider more room to boost a share buyback program to $2 billion. Adjusted earnings per ADS was $1.43 a share, exceeding the $1.28 average of analyst projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue climbed 36 percent to 18.4 billion yuan ($2.89 billion), matching estimates.

Baidu said this week its Qunar travel site will form an alliance and swap shares with rival Ctrip.com, the latest move toward consolidation in China’s Internet industry. Baidu’s three major new businesses, video service iQiyi, online commerce site Nuomi and travel site Qunar, remain loss-making, dragging on profit generated by its core search advertising business. By taking a 25 percent stake in Ctrip, in return for 45 percent of Qunar, Baidu intends to cut costs and benefit from reduced competition. That may affect Baidu’s revenue.\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft Sells $13 Billion of Bonds in Month\\'s Busiest Day:\\xa0Microsoft tapped the bond market for $13 billion Thursday, its biggest sale ever, in the busiest session of the month for high-grade issuers. The seven-part deal eclipsed a mark set just eight months ago by the tech giant as it raises money to repurchase stock and repay existing debt. It sold its longest portion, a 40-year bond, at a yield that was 1.8 percentage points more than comparable government debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company sold $3 billion of 10-year notes at a spread of 0.18 percentage point more than its similar maturity debt in the secondary market on Wednesday. “This is a banner year for tech issuance, so they needed to price wide to get people to take down $13 billion,” CreditSights Inc. analyst Jordan Chalfin said in an interview. “For Microsoft, an extra five-10 basis points doesn’t really matter. Their debt-funded share buybacks are very accretive for equity holders.” Microsoft, one of only three non-financial companies with top AAA credit ratings, said in a filing on Thursday that it will use the proceeds for anything from working capital to stock repurchases and repayment of existing debt.\\n\\n\\nLinkedIn Earnings Beat Expectations With $780M In Revenue, Stock Jumps 9%:\\xa0LinkedIn handily beat analyst expectations today with revenue of $780 million and earnings of 78 cents per share. Analysts were expecting earnings of 45 cents per share on about $756 million in revenue. LinkedIn shares promptly spiked as much as 8 percent in extended trading. In total, the company’s revenue grew 37 percent year-over-year, up from around $568 million in the third quarter last year. The company’s Talent Solutions division was its fastest growing segment, up 46 percent year-over-year to $502 million in revenue. Marketing solutions grew 28 percent to $140 million in revenue, while subscription revenue grew 21 percent year-over-year to $138 million to round out the rest of the company’s revenue report. LinkedIn’s domestic growth continues at a healthy clip, up to $484 million in revenue from $343 million in the third quarter last year, up 41 percent. Its international segment is still not quite as large as its domestic business, but was still up from $225 million to $295 million, a jump of 31 percent. Basically, its domestic business is performing stronger than its international business — which is not all that surprising given the big presence and brand it has in the U.S. So, as expected, the company’s recruiting segment continues to be one of its fastest-growing. LinkedIn has basically become the go-to service for what are effectively a more modern form of resumes, making it a gold mine for recruiters seeking new talent. So it’s not all that surprising that recruiting and the company’s Talent Solutions division is one of its most important — and getting a lot of attention. The company has two new launches coming up — its referrals product in November, and a new revamped Recruiter platform coming early next year. Both those products are geared toward better automating the process, and eliminating redundant tasks, of searching for new recruits.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFlipboard\\'s Fanfare Fades as Executives Exit, Sale Talks Stall:\\xa0Flipboard Inc. debuted in 2010 with the kind of fanfare any startup would envy. The news-reading app piggybacked perfectly on the debut of Apple’s iPad tablet and Steve Jobs’s promise of a new era for digital media. Critics loved Flipboard’s magazine-like layout, created by one of the first software designers of the iPhone, and investors poured money into the company. Almost five years later, Flipboard is struggling to live up to the praise. Several senior executives have departed, including co-founder Evan Doll, and talks to sell the company haven’t reached the finish line, according to people familiar with the plans, who asked not be named discussing private matters. Flipboard’s woes are indicative of a larger malaise gripping startups across the technology landscape as questions emerge about the sustainability of the tech-investment boom. Flipboard is performing well enough -- and, after raising more capital earlier this year, is at no risk of going out of business -- but is no longer a breakaway hit. People are finding media through their Facebook or Twitter feeds, limiting the need for a stand-alone application like Flipboard. Meanwhile, advertising rates -- the company’s main revenue stream-- have been in decline. While Flipboard’s reading app was a showpiece for the iPad five years ago, the company is now working to adjust to a changing digital-news market and live up to its $800 million valuation. Other companies facing similar questions about whether they can make good on early investor expectations -- and lofty private-market valuations -- include online storage service Dropbox Inc., note-taking company Evernote Corp., music-streaming service Deezer SA and blood-testing company Theranos Inc., said Anand Sanwal, chief executive officer of CB Insights, a firm that tracks startup investing. The companies face a challenge in that they could be too expensive for another company to buy, yet may not have the business fundamentals to justify their valuations to public investors through an initial public offering, he said.\\n\\n\\nSamsung Deploys Cash Pile With $10 Billion Buyback, Capex Boost, As Phones Fail To Revive Growth:\\xa0Samsung Electronics is tapping its $50 billion cash pile to buy back shares and invest in its components business after struggles in the smartphone division battered investors. Shares surged. The company will buy back and cancel 11.3 trillion won ($10 billion) of shares and boost capital spending by 14 percent this year, Samsung said Thursday. The announcements came after the company posted profit that trailed analyst estimates. Capital expenditure will rise to 27 trillion won this year as the company invests in chips and display plants. \\xa0Samsung is struggling for an answer to Apple Inc. in high-end smartphones, trying price cuts, a $120 rebate program and new models to tempt consumers from buying iPhones. That has prompted a renewed focus on making components for earnings growth, with new semiconductor and display plants to get its parts into other vendors devices. Samsung said it will increase capital spending after posting profit that missed analysts’ estimates as price cuts on new Galaxy S6 smartphones failed to sway consumers from buying iPhones. Capital expenditure will rise 14 percent to 27 trillion won ($24 billion) this year, the company said Thursday. Net income, excluding minority interests, was 5.31 trillion won ($4.7 billion) in the third quarter with profit to fall in the current period, Samsung said. Increased marketing spending, including a $120 rebate program, hasn’t sparked sales of the premium devices that generate fatter profit margins. Samsung is investing in computer chip plants as it tries to revive Galaxy smartphone demand through a new mobile payment service and by releasing larger devices at least a month before the new iPhones to recapture market share from Apple Inc. Shares of Samsung rose 4.9 percent in Seoul, the highest since May. The rally erased their decline for the year.\\n\\n\\nEbay Exceeds Expectations While Paypal Flops: PayPal CEO Dan Schulman defended his strategy of inking deals with big merchants and smartphone applications and offering free peer-to-peer payments as investors sent shares down on concerns the efforts are hurting the company’s quarterly profit. PayPal, in its first quarter as a stand-alone company separate from EBay Inc., said it added 4 million accounts to reach 173 million users. Its total payments volume gained 20 percent to $69.7 billion from a year earlier. But investors reacted to the company’s declining take rate, a measure of how much money PayPal keeps from each payment made on its platform. That metric fell to 3.24 percent in the third quarter from 3.39 percent a year earlier, the company reported Wednesday in a statement, and shares dropped as much as 7.8 percent in extended trading. The goal of the July split with EBay was to make sure that each company could focus on their main businesses. EBay last week reported quarterly profit and sales that topped analysts’ estimates and raised its outlook, sending shares up the most in 10 years. PayPal’s strategy is to attract more customers and merchants and offer them expanded services as competition in the payments industry intensifies with startups Square Inc. and Stripe Inc. as well has Apple Inc. and Google Inc. who are trying to create digital wallets. Even JPMorgan Chase & Co., entered the digital payments race Monday. PayPal is processing more payments in stores like Macy’s and on popular smartphone applications like Uber and Airbnb. But PayPal keeps less money from each transaction because the clients that bring bigger volume to the payments company also have the leverage to negotiate lower rates. The downside of that strategy was on display when Square disclosed its money-losing relationship with Starbucks Corp. The challenge for Schulman is to differentiate PayPal as competition intensifies. Among the additional services the company offers is a merchant cash advance program called PayPal Working Capital, which gives preapproved loans to businesses that process payments through PayPal. PayPal also is getting into the international money-transfer business by purchasing Xoom Corp. for $890 million in a deal announced in July.\\n\\n\\nYelp - struggling so far this year - beats Street expectations on revenue sending shares up 7%:\\xa0Yelp reported a bigger-than-expected 40 percent jump in quarterly revenue as more local businesses advertised on Yelp.com, its consumer review website. Shares of the company, whose website and app allow users to rate restaurants and a variety of other businesses, rose about 7 percent after the bell on Wednesday. To Wednesday\\'s close of $22.07, Yelp\\'s stock had fallen nearly 60 percent this year. San Francisco-based Yelp, which gets about four-fifths of its revenue from local advertisers, said the number of local advertising accounts rose about 37 percent to 104,200 in the third quarter. Yelp has been investing to grow its website beyond user reviews by investing in services such as restaurant reservations, food ordering and delivery. The company reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $8.1 million, or 11 cents per share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a profit of $3.6 million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $143.6 million from $102.5 million.\\n\\n\\nVerizon says Internet of Things revenue at $500 million year-to-date.\\xa0Aimed at connecting to the Internet everything from household devices to industrial machines, the business is growing at a \"double-digit\" rate, Mike Lanman, senior vice president of enterprise products at Verizon said at an event in San Francisco. \"A large portion of our revenue comes through connectivity but a significant part of it comes from the application layer already,\" he said in a phone interview after introducing a platform to help customers develop applications in healthcare, agriculture, utilities and connected cars. Last year, Verizon\\'s annual revenue from the business totaled $585 million. The global Internet of Things market is expected to grow to $1.7 trillion in 2020 from $656 billion in 2014, according to market research firm IDC. Examples include Verizon\\'s fleet management tracking application and a partnership with Intel Corp (INTC.O) to provide water management sensors in vineyards, Lanman said. At the event, Verizon also unveiled a chip that Lanman said halves the cost of connecting low data usage devices like dog trackers to high-speed networks. AT&T has also been working on growing its \"Internet of Things\" business and previously launched initiatives such as a cloud-based data-analytics platform for companies and a global SIM card for connected cars. AT&T said last week it added 1.6 million connected devices including 1 million connected cars in the third quarter of 2015.\\n\\n\\nAlphabet, Indonesian companies to expand Web access via balloons:\\xa0Alphabet, the new holding company for Google, has teamed up with three Indonesian telecommunications companies to expand Internet access in that country using solar-powered balloons. Alphabet officials, including co-founder Sergey Brin, and representatives from Indonesian companies Telkomsel, XL Axiata Tbk PT (EXCL.JK) and Indosat Tbk PT (ISAT.JK) signed an agreement Wednesday to bring so-called Project Loon to the nation of 250 million people. The project sends solar-powered balloons 16,000 feet (5,000 meters) into the air to deliver Internet access through radio frequency signals to antennae connected to buildings on the ground. The balloons use algorithms to find the best winds to carry them along their charted course. Project Loon is part of Alphabet\\'s secretive X division, where the company experiments with far-off technologies dubbed \"moonshots\" such as its self-driving car technology. Alphabet and its partners will deploy hundreds of balloons in 2016 over the country of more than 17,000 islands in an effort to determine where gaps in service lie as part of the tests before full-scale service is launched. The U.S. tech company has already tested the project in Brazil, New Zealand and Australia but with only a single carrier. Project Loon Vice President Mike Cassidy said the Indonesian partnership marks the first time it will send signals from multiple telecommunications companies through a single balloon, and that it will be the service\\'s largest deployment to date and could eventually reach 100 million users. Cassidy said the effort is also a model for how Alphabet will move the product into the commercial market. He said the telecommunications companies will use the trial period to determine pricing and billing while Google works out technical issues.\\n\\n\\nGoPro Plunges 15% After-Hours Following Q3 Earnings Miss:\\xa0GoPro took a dive Wednesday after releasing Q3 financials that disappointed street expectations. At the market’s close, GoPro reported a miss on its Q3 earnings, posting an adjusted $0.25 per share on $400.3 million non-GAAP revenue during the period. Those figures compared to street expectations of a $0.29 per-share profit, and revenue of $433.6 million. The action camera maker’s $400.3 revenues represented a 43% year-over-year increase from $280.0 in Q3 2015, with EPS also up significantly from $0.12 in the corresponding quarter last year. The company shipped 1.6 million camera devices in Q3, up 46% from Q3 2014, but still less than the street had expected. Interestingly, GoPro emphasized how important foreign markets, specifically China, had been to the company’s growth. Sales outside of the U.S. reportedly made up more than 50% of the company’s revenue. The company said China was “the fastest growing market in GoPro’s history.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Profit Is Up 31%, Revenue Up 22% as iPhones Sell Briskly, but Its Forecast Is Muted:\\xa0Apple on Tuesday turned in another quarter of enviable revenue and profit growth, fueled by sales of the iPhone. But the results raised a perennial question for the world’s most valuable company: How can it keep its growth streak alive? The issue was stoked by Apple’s muted forecast for its all-important holiday quarter, as well as the unwillingness of Timothy D. Cook, the company’s chief executive, to go into detail in an earnings conference call about how Apple plans to rev up sales next year. Over all, Apple posted a profit of $11.1 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter, up 31 percent from a year ago. Revenue was $51.5 billion, up 22 percent from last year. The results exceeded Wall Street estimates. Yet while the performance was bolstered by sales of the iPhone — Apple said that it sold 48 million iPhones in the quarter, up from 39 million in the same period last year — the company was more cautious about sales for the key holiday sales period. Apple projected revenue of $75.5 billion to $77.5 billion for the end-of-year quarter. While the sheer numbers are huge, the low end of the forecast fell below Wall Street estimates and would amount to anemic growth of less than 4 percent from a year ago. The last time Apple’s quarterly sales fell below 4 percent was in mid-2013.\\xa0New Products:\\xa0Apple is going into 2016 with a full slate of refreshed products. In late September, the company introduced its newest iPhone models, the 6s and 6s Plus. It also announced a larger iPad, the iPad Pro, and will begin shipping a new Apple TV this week.\\xa0IPad Struggles:\\xa0While the iPhone continues to grow, the iPad has been facing declines. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Apple said iPad sales dropped 20 percent from a year ago, making it the seventh consecutive quarter that sales of the tablet have slipped. The company is increasingly positioning the iPad as a business device.\\xa0Apple Watch:\\xa0The company did not break out sales of the Apple Watch, which debuted in April. But the category called “other products” — which includes the watch — posted $3 billion in revenue in the quarter, up from $2.6 billion in the previous quarter, which was the first quarter that included sales of the device. Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies, said that the numbers for the “other” category were in line with his expectations, and implied somewhere between 3.5 million and four million watches were sold over the quarter.\\xa0China:\\xa0One of Apple’s fastest-growing markets — China — continued to grow. Sales in the region that Apple calls Greater China jumped 99 percent in the quarter to $12.5 billion. The region remained the company’s second-largest market after the Americas, accounting for 24 percent of sales in the quarter, compared with 13.7 percent a year ago. Investors have been scrutinizing the China business given that the country has been cutting interest rates to shore up a slowing economy.\\xa0Apple Pay:\\xa0Apple said it has partnered with American Express to bring its Apple Pay mobile payments service to global markets. Chief Executive Tim Cook said the credit card company will bring the service to customers in Australia and Canada, then expand to Spain, Hong Kong and Singapore in 2016.\\n\\n\\nDismal Twitter Forecast and Flat User Growth Send Its Stock Lower:\\xa0On Tuesday, Twitter gave a dismal forecast for its fourth-quarter revenue and profits. Shares in Twitter, a social media company, plunged as much as 13 percent in after-hours trading as Mr. Dorsey and his lieutenants offered little explanation for the gloom in a conference call with investors. In a similar call three months ago, Mr. Dorsey’s pointed critique of Twitter’s product failings sent the stock down 11 percent. Twitter also reported revenue of $569 million for the quarter, up 58 percent from $361 million a year ago. Its net loss was $132 million, or 20 cents a share, compared to a loss of $175 million, or 29 cents a share, in the same quarter last year. For the fourth quarter, usually the strongest thanks to holiday advertising, Twitter warned that revenue would be $695 million to $710 million, well below the $740 million that Wall Street had been expecting. The new projections, delivered as the company exceeded analysts’ expectations for its third-quarter results, provided fresh evidence that Twitter is failing to win over advertisers, the source of most of its revenue, as it confronts stiffening competition from Facebook, Instagram and Google. “The company is finding real challenges gaining traction with advertisers,” said Mark Mahaney, an Internet analyst with RBC Capital Markets, citing the new forecasts and an advertiser survey his firm conducts twice a year. Mr. Mahaney, who has a neutral rating on Twitter’s stock, said he was struck by the contrast between the upbeat tone of Twitter’s executives on the call and the company’s deteriorating outlook. “Everything sounds so good, yet you reduced your forecast pretty materially. Why?” Mr. Dorsey didn’t answer that question, although Adam Bain, the company’s former ad chief and new chief operating officer, offered a clue: Ad prices plunged 39 percent in the third quarter, which he said was partly because of improved efficiency of video ads.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba Revenue Up 32%, Sends Shares up 4%; Cloud Computing Revenue Doubles Y/Y; Overseas Sales at 8%; GMV growth sinks to lowest in 3 years:\\xa0China\\'s Alibaba is squeezing more money from online shopping than expected, beating analyst forecasts for revenue growth, as mobile shopping grows. The company wrung out higher-than-expected revenue growth of 32 percent year-on-year, even as gross merchandise volume (GMV), the total value of goods transacted across its platforms, sank to its slowest annual growth rate in more than three years.\\xa0Alibaba\\'s U.S.-listed shares closed about 4 percent higher on Tuesday, after rising as much as 8.4 percent during market hours.\\xa0Alibaba is trying to replace decelerating volume growth in online shopping with new kinds of online buying, mirrored in its latest investments. For instance, Alibaba invested $4.6 billion in Suning during the quarter. It also offered $3.5 billion to become sole owner of Youku Tudou, known as China\\'s YouTube. Online video users in the country are beginning to cough up money for high-quality online streaming services. But the majority of Alibaba\\'s revenue still comes from China\\'s online shoppers buying from domestic businesses, a business driven by growth in GMV. For the latest quarter, growth came mostly from Tmall, an Amazon-like website allowing businesses to sell to customers, where GMV rose 56 percent. Gains at Taobao, more akin to eBay and by far the company\\'s biggest contributor to GMV, showed signs of slowing at just 15 percent. Alibaba\\'s revenue rose to $3.49 billion in the three months ended Sept. 30. Net income attributable to shareholders reached $3.58 billion, or $1.40 per share.\\xa0International Expansion:\\xa0The proportion of revenue Alibaba gets from abroad reached 8 percent, compared with 9 percent in the previous quarter. Co-founder Jack Ma has said he wants half of the company’s sales to originate outside China. The company named Michael Evans, a former Goldman Sachs \\xa0partner, as president in August to spearhead a global expansion into regions such as Russia and Brazil. The company is also looking to make forays into Italy, France, Australia and New Zealand, Evans said in October.\\xa0Cloud Business:\\xa0Revenue from cloud computing more than doubled from a year earlier. The e-commerce giant is betting on Internet-based computing and big data to boost growth for the next decade thanks to demand for processing and storage from governments, finance and online gaming companies. AliCloud could account for more than $1 billion of Alibaba’s revenue by 2018\\n\\n\\nIBM says SEC investigating company\\'s books, shares fall:\\xa0The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating how the International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) recognized revenue for certain deals in the United States, Britain and Ireland, IBM said on Tuesday, news that sent its shares down 4 percent. Shares of IBM fell as much as 4.4 percent to a five-year low of $137.33 and closed down 4 percent. News of the SEC probe came a week after the company posted lackluster quarterly results and cut its 2015 profit forecast. \"It couldn\\'t come at a worse possible time because now the stock is at another 52-week low as a result of this,\" said Belpointe analyst David Nelson. He said, however, that the probe \"doesn\\'t look like a massive smoking gun.\" \"The investigation could be into warranty reserves, they could have recognized an item at the wrong time,\" Nelson said.\\n\\n\\nPayPal says makes $1 billion in small-business loans in first two years:\\xa0PayPal Holdings, the online payment processor, said on Tuesday its small-business lending program has processed $1 billion in loans in the first two years of its launch and more than doubled loan growth in that span. PayPal Working Capital is extending short-term loans totaling more than $100 million per month, or $3 million per day, to a mix of sellers on eBay and standalone small- to medium-sized merchants, the company said at a payments conference in Las Vegas. PayPal separated from eBay earlier this year, and Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman has stated he is looking to use PayPal\\'s size to offer affordable financial services widely.\\n\\n\\nEven As Oracle and AWS Circle Each Other, Oracle Will Not Build a Giant Cloud System Like AWS:\\xa0Counter to the expectations of many industry watchers, Oracle, the world’s largest maker of software for businesses, is not planning a global computing system to rival Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, the other big global cloud companies. While it has built out a network of 20 data centers, largely filled with Oracle equipment, it now plans to go after customers by offering faster updates of its core products, new ways of customizing applications and a much younger, retooled sales force. “We’ve made our investments,” Mark Hurd, co-chief executive of Oracle, said in an interview. Compared with A.W.S., he said, “the place we like is one of higher profit margins.” Besides applications, Amazon sells raw computing and data storage, which are generally lower-margin businesses. Oracle is expected Tuesday to announce better security inside its cloud because of changes from its proprietary hardware, but won’t sell access to the machines on their own. Oracle’s better margins, Mr. Hurd said, will come from selling large-scale software that can be customized by its buyers to suit local markets and products. He hopes to lower his sales costs and bring in younger companies with salespeople recruited straight from college and given crash courses in selling Oracle cloud products. In the last four years, he said, the company has hired 1,000 graduates a year. “We train them in products, sales skills and processes,” said Mr. Hurd. “They’re selling within a year, with a much lower cost of sales.” Oracle’s sales force, some 30,000 people globally, is considered among the most aggressive and highly compensated in the tech business. Now, Mr. Hurd said, “we have to do some branding” to entice the kind of smaller companies and start-ups the new sales team is chasing. The ease of modification and the faster sales force illustrate how, while still far apart, Oracle and A.W.S. are becoming more like each other as cloud computing goes mainstream. For its part, a few weeks ago A.W.S. dropped all pretense and made a direct bid for Oracle’s customers. A.W.S. even put up a thinly disguised picture of Oracle founder and executive chairman Larry Ellison.\\n\\n\\nJapan\\'s Carmakers Proceed With Caution on Self-Driving Cars:\\xa0At this week’s Tokyo Motor Show, Nissan Motor Co. will display a concept car with retractable steering wheel and message-flashing windshield, joining Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. in exhibiting vehicles with autonomous modes for changing lanes and avoiding collisions on highways. But while Tesla deployed its Autopilot system this month and Google aims to have fully self-driving cars on the road by 2020, Japan’s automakers see a wait for such vehicles, with introductions coming only after 2025. The unwillingness to take a software-testing approach -- with beta versions used for trial periods and ongoing updates -- and apply this to car-making divides traditional auto companies and tech-industry challengers, said Tatsuo Yoshida, an auto industry analyst with Barclays Plc. Whereas Tesla beamed Autopilot into Model S sedans with the promise the system would continually learn and improve itself, Japan’s automakers view such an approach as putting features on the road before they’re ready. They’re also wary of exposure to liability if they introduce safety features that fail. Each of Japan’s three biggest automakers have set targets to start deploying the technology around 2020. Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk told reporters this month the company can probably develop a completely self-driving car in about three years, while Google has forecast about a five-year time frame.\\n\\n\\nRackspace Launches Carina, A Hosted Environment For Running Docker Containers:\\xa0Rackspace is getting deeper into the container game. The company today announced the beta launch of its Carina container service. Carina gives developers access to a fully managed container environment that offers bare-metal performance and still allows them to use the same native Docker tools they are used to from their local development environments. Right now, the service — which will remain available for free during what the team expects to be a long beta period — focuses on Docker’s tooling, but over time, the idea here is to use the flexibility of Magnum and OpenStack to give developers the ability to use other container orchestration engines like Kubernetes and Mesos, as well. The team believes that the combination of a multi-tenant environment and (near) bare-metal access will allow it to deliver the right mix of a high-performance system and low cost. Otto acknowledged a multi-tenant system may not be the right choice for workloads that are highly security sensitive, but the service also gives users the choice to also run containers on Rackspace’s private cloud service. The service provides users with a set of defaults based on the company’s experience, but users can then tweak these as necessary. Otto believes most users will opt to stay with Docker Swarm as the container orchestration engine, simply because it gives users more control (and in an imperative way) than Kubernetes, which is far more opinionated. Because of the way the company architected the service without using a traditional hypervisor (using libvirt/LXC instead), containers will start significantly faster than on a similar service that uses more traditional virtual machines. Because there are still some advantages to running containers on virtual machines — especially when it comes to security — Rackspace also plans to support virtual machines. It’s no secret that large public cloud vendors like Google, AWS and Microsoft now all offer their own container services. The Rackspace team believes that it has an advantage over them in terms of speed, but also because they don’t abstract away the containers from developers. In addition — and this is no surprise coming from Rackspace — the company believes it can offer a level of service that is significantly higher than its competitors. Rackspace already worked with a number of partners to test the service in a private beta. These include O’Reilly Media, which is using containers to power parts of its online learning tools, as well as the Drupal and WordPress hosting service Pantheon, which has long used containers at the core of its platform.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",
      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\n\\nReuters Exclusive: Wal-Mart seeks to test drones for home delivery, pickup:\\xa0Wal-Mart applied Monday to U.S. regulators for permission to test drones for home delivery, curbside pickup and checking warehouse inventories, a sign it plans to go head-to-head with Amazon in using drones to fill and deliver online orders. The world\\'s largest retailer by revenue has for several months been conducting indoor tests of small unmanned aircraft systems – the term regulators use for drones - and is now seeking for the first time to test the machines outdoors. It plans to use drones manufactured by China\\'s SZ DJI. In addition to having drones take inventory of trailers outside its warehouses and perform other tasks aimed at making its distribution system more efficient, Wal-Mart is asking the Federal Aviation Administration for permission to research drone use in \"deliveries to customers at Walmart facilities, as well as to consumer homes,\" according to a copy of the application reviewed by Reuters. The move comes as Amazon.com, Google and other companies test drones in the expectation that the FAA will soon establish rules for their widespread commercial use. FAA Deputy Administrator Michael Whitaker said in June that the agency expected to finalize regulations within the next 12 months, faster than previously planned. Commercial drone use is currently illegal, though companies can apply for exemptions.\\n\\n\\n\\'Bottomed Out\\' Alibaba Set for Best Month After Post-IPO Crash:\\xa0Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. looks like it may be bottoming out after suffering the worst post-IPO crash ever. Shares are heading for their best month ever, and analysts have raised their sales projections in the past four weeks. Results due Tuesday are expected to show revenue growth of 27 percent in the September quarter, while in the background China’s leaders draft plans for stimulating the economy during the next five years. Chairman Jack Ma pulled off a record initial public offering as investors backed his bet on e-commerce and Alibaba catapulted to the top of the market in China. Then the domestic economy slowed to its weakest growth in 25 years, prompting the billionaire to calm investor fears that at one point erased $150 billion from its market value -- the equivalent of an International Business Machines Corp. The stock fell to a record low of $57.20 on Sept. 29, or 16 percent below its IPO price. Since then it has surged 33 percent, closing Monday at $76.35, up 1 percent for the day. That has come as at least four analysts covering Alibaba raised estimates. Sales in the September quarter are expected to be 21.4 billion yuan ($3.4 billion), with adjusted earnings-per-share of 3.44 yuan, according to estimates. New cloud-based services for merchants to reach consumers and an expansion of entertainment and local-services businesses are central tenets of Ma’s growth strategy. Increased promotions on Tmall.com and Taobao Marketplace are driving e-commerce ahead of next month’s Singles’ Day, the country’s biggest shopping event. The company also offered $4.6 billion for the rest of Youku Tudou Inc., a YouTube-like website, to add content it can stream to Internet users and to bolster revenue beyond e-commerce. Alibaba is expanding its London office to serve as its European hub and opening up in France and Germany.\\n\\n\\nJPMorgan Chase says it is building a rival to Apple Pay:\\xa0JPMorgan Chase said on Monday it will soon launch its own competitor to Apple Pay that will allow consumers to pay retailers using their smartphones in stores, and it has already won the endorsement of a major group of merchants. The largest U.S. bank is the latest company to try to profit from the prevalence of smartphones, which many financial executives believe will one day be consumers\\' preferred way to pay for everything from milk and eggs at the supermarket to a rental car at an airport. The companies that figure out how to convince consumers to stop pulling credit cards out of their wallets and start paying with their phones stand to earn vast sums by taking a percentage of the trillions of dollars that consumers spend annually. No clear front-runner has emerged in the business yet. Chase believes its smart phone application, known as Chase Pay, has one key advantage: the caliber of retailers it has brought on board, Gordon Smith, chief executive of the bank\\'s consumer business, told Reuters. Chase has signed a deal with the Merchant Customer Exchange, a group of major retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, (WMT.N) the largest U.S. retailer, and Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) to accept payments through the bank\\'s technology. Retailers included in the Merchant Customer Exchange ring up more than $1 trillion of sales per year and have over 100,000 outlets. Rivals like Apply Pay have struggled to sign up retailers to accept their payments. In June, Reuters interviewed the top 100 U.S. retailers and found that two-thirds said they did not plan to accept Apple Pay this year. Apple Pay\\'s website lists Best Buy in its \"Coming Soon\" section but has no mention of Wal-Mart. Chase signed up the Merchant Customer Exchange mainly by promising to cut retailers\\' costs, Smith said. Whenever a consumer pays for something with plastic, the retailer pays fees to banks and credit card networks to process the transaction. Chase is willing to accept a lower fee for Chase Pay transactions than for other transactions, and hopes to make up the difference by getting more volume over its network, Smith said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBig headlines from last week:\\xa0Smashing earnings from \\xa0Alphabet (the new Google), Amazon and Microsoft.

Facebook is investing heavily in other parts of the project, including experiments to deliver cheap Wi-Fi to remote villages and to beam Internet service from high-flying drones. Mr. Zuckerberg is also determined to win over the Indian public. Last month, he hosted a live-streamed chat with India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, from Facebook’s Silicon Valley headquarters. And this week, Mr. Zuckerberg will be in New Delhi, where he will take questions from some of Facebook’s 130 million Indian users. Internet.org’s free services — which include news articles, health and job information and a text-only version of Facebook — are deliberately stripped down to minimize data use and the cost to the phone company. Facebook says the primary goal is to show people what the Internet is all about. But many Indians want more and complain that, contrary to its altruistic claims, the project is simply a way to get them onto Facebook and to sign up for paid plans from Reliance. Internet activists have also attacked Facebook, accusing it of cherry-picking partners to include in its walled garden rather than simply offering a small amount of free access to the whole Internet. Their concerns have struck a chord with the Indian government, which is considering new rules that would govern such free services. The magnitude of the task ahead was apparent during a reporter’s visit in August to Dharavi, home to as many as a million of Mumbai’s poor. Several billboards advertised Freenet, Reliance’s version of Internet.org. But in the neighborhood’s narrow alleys, where rivulets of raw sewage competed with sandaled feet, there was little evidence that anyone had taken notice. At Yahoo Mobilewala, a nearby phone shop named in honor of the American Internet company, the owner, Rizwan Khan, offered service from every major carrier. But his stack of Reliance chips — each in a blue Freenet envelope that said “Go free Facebook” — was gathering dust in its display case.\\n\\n\\nRumor:\\xa0Uber Refueling Its Warchest Yet Again, At A Valuation Of Up To $70B:\\xa0Another month, another billion for Uber… The ride-hailing business is reportedly raising yet again — planning to raise close to $1 billion in new investment according to the NYT citing “people close to the matter”, with investors looking at a valuation of between $60 billion and $70 billion for the six-year-old startup. If the NYT’s report is on the money, it comes mere months after the WSJ reported Uber had raised almost $1 billion in new financing, with a valuation then, in July, of more than $50 billion.\\n\\n\\nFacebook updates its search feature to drive more conversation:\\xa0On Thursday, Facebook announced that it\\'s making a few updates to the way search works on the site to make it easier than ever to find conversations running through your social circle. In a company blog post, Facebook said that it wants to make search a better tool for sparking conversation on the social network. For example, public posts or posts made by your friends will begin showing up in search results, as will what Facebook calls \"public conversations.\" Basically, that enables Facebook to become a place where people can more easily dip into discussions about the topic of the day. \"When a link gets shared widely on Facebook, it often anchors an interesting public conversation,\" the company said in a post. \"With one tap, you can find public posts about a link, see popular quotes and phrases mentioned in these posts, and check out an aggregate overview of sentiment.\" So if you found yourself completely perplexed by \"pizza rat\" or \"pirate cat\" or, you know, \"Hillary Clinton Benghazi hearing,\" you should be able to hop into Facebook and look up what your friends and others are saying about it. The updates to search will start rolling out for its U.S. English users Thursday, Facebook said, with more plans for search \\xa0in the pipeline.\\n\\n\\nYouTube has a new music service...\\xa0What is YouTube Music? YouTube Music is a new app from Google that lets you specifically search for music on the site. That means you get more focused results — a search for \"Prince,\" for example, won\\'t bring up videos about royalty. Well, not of the non-musical variety, anyway. The app will also suggest other songs that you may like, based on your preferences. Doesn\\'t YouTube already have a music service? You may remember that YouTube previously launched a service called YouTube Music Key, which was in an open beta, and seems to have been discontinued in light of the new service. how does this work with YouTube\\'s new subscription service, YouTube Red? Subscribing to YouTube Red, Google\\'s new ad-free subscription service, will get you access to ad-free versions of YouTube, YouTube Gaming and YouTube Music, plus Google Play Music. That will cost you $10 per month if you\\'re an Android user and $13 per month if you\\'re on iOS. You will be able to use the YouTube Music app for free, but those who don\\'t pay will still see ads and not have access to some of the more advanced features. How does this stack up against other services? You could always listen to YouTube, with ads, for free, so why would you pay for that? There are a few perks that may convince you. For one, you no longer have to leave the soundtrack of your day up to the whim of the auto-play algorithm or take the time to actually make your own playlists. Plus, on mobile, you couldn\\'t just keep it running in the background — if you wanted to listen to YouTube, that was all you were going to do. YouTube Music fixes all of these problems. Can I download it now? Not yet. You will have to wait a little while. Although YouTube Red will launch next Thursday, the Music portion of it is scheduled to be out only by the end of the year.\\n\\n\\n..and that caused Disney\\'s ESPN to withdraw content from YouTube:\\xa0Walt Disney Co\\'s sports network ESPN said it will not make its content available on YouTube, due to the recently announced ad-free subscription-based offering coined YouTube Red. ESPN would not be part of the subscription service at launch due to \"rights and legal\" issues, a YouTube spokeswoman told Reuters.\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft Goes Upscale With Fifth Avenue Flagship Store:\\xa0Most of the luxury brands on the storefronts of Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, one of the world’s most famous shopping thoroughfares, seem to belong together, like the notes of a song. There are Tiffany & Company, Gucci, Armani, Valentino, Rolex and — cue the sound of a record needle sliding off vinyl — Microsoft? Yes, the company that brought us Windows and Office is opening a store on the street that brought us $5,000 handbags and $20,000 watches. The doors of the striking new flagship Microsoft Store will open to the public on Monday. It’s an expensive gamble on a retail strategy that is still a long way from paying off. It does not take a detective to see that the foot traffic is often light at the Microsoft stores the company has opened — the Fifth Avenue store will be its 113th — over the last six years. That’s a contrast with the jamborees usually found over at Apple’s stores, inevitably a few blocks away or across the mall from Microsoft’s electronics boutiques. I got a preview tour of the store last week. It’s clear the building renovation cost a fortune, though Microsoft executives wouldn’t say how much. The company gutted a building from the 1930s that was previously a Fendi store, replacing all but the top of its facade with huge sheets of glass. Walking into the store, what hits you first are the Microsoft devices arrayed on large open tables in the middle of the room. There is a collection of Surface Books, the company’s first laptop, which has received positive reviews and goes on sale Monday. Nearby is the Surface Pro 4, the latest version of the company’s popular tablet computer. An Xbox set up in the front corner of the store — an area Microsoft calls the living room — lets people play Halo 5: Guardians, the science-fiction shooter game that goes on sale Tuesday. Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, is showing more patience with the company’s stores than he has with other unfulfilled initiatives begun under his predecessor, Steven A. Ballmer. Mr. Nadella shut down a Microsoft group that made television shows for people with Xboxes, and he cut the staff working on Microsoft’s phone hardware to a fraction of its former size. Why do Microsoft Stores survive? The bricks-and-mortar alternatives for showing new Microsoft products in their best light are not great. The number of electronics stores has dwindled, leaving just one giant in the United States, Best Buy. And while the stores of wireless carriers are good for putting smartphones in front of the public, category-bending tablets and laptops often require explanations from more-trained specialists.\\n\\n\\nHackers Demand Ransom From TalkTalk, British Telecom Firm\\xa0...BAE Hired to Investigate:\\xa0The chief executive of TalkTalk, a British telecommunications provider, said on Friday that she had received a ransom demand from hackers who had claimed responsibility for stealing data on some of the company’s four million customers. TalkTalk, which offers cable and fixed-line services in Britain, said local authorities had opened a criminal investigation into the widespread data breach. The hackers may have gained access to personal data on the company’s customers, including sensitive information like credit card details, dates of birth and addresses. TalkTalk’s shares fell as much as 11 percent in morning trading in London, but recovered by the afternoon and were down 2.3 percent in midafternoon trading. Despite the claims of responsibility, it remained unclear whether the group that had contacted TalkTalk was behind the breach or whether the ransom demands were credible. Yet TalkTalk’s data breach — the third successful attack on the company in the past 12 months — is the latest in a number of online hackings that have affected a wide range of companies, including Target, Home Depot and JPMorgan Chase. It also potentially represents a high-profile example of hackers’ efforts to ransom stolen online data to companies or individuals. Such tactics, commonly known as ransomware, have often involved hackers encrypting people’s computer data and holding it hostage until a fee is paid. In certain instances, hackers have also stolen data directly from companies and demanded payment for not publishing the material online.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll be out for about a week, snippets will resume once I\\'m back :)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNetflix falls 9% as weak subscriber additions at odds with lofty valuation:\\xa0Investors questioned Netflix Inc\\'s premium valuation after the video-streaming service reported U.S. subscriber additions below its own expectations, a sign that competition from the likes of Hulu is intensifying. Netflix shares fell more than 9 percent to $100.11 in early trading on Thursday. While Netflix blamed the disappointing numbers on the mandated transition to chip-based debit and credit cards, some analysts said the reason seemed unconvincing since these cards have been around for a while. \"The Netflix excuse is laughable,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, who is rated four stars on a scale of five on StarMine for the accuracy of earnings estimates of Netflix. \"Credit cards expire all the time, and people know how to deal with it. Netflix is seeing declining demand, and churn is a part of that,\" he said. Netflix doesn\\'t disclose churn or subscriber attrition numbers. The video-streaming service provider had forecast a net addition of 1.15 million subscribers in its home market in the quarter, but ended up with just 880,000. Netflix\\'s stock has more than doubled this year. It trades at 356.6 times forward 12 month earnings, versus a peer median of 12.9.\\n\\n\\nTesla Adds High-Speed Autonomous Driving to Its Bag of Tricks:\\xa0It is not every day you get to open a door and step into the future. But to pull the handle on a newly updated Tesla Model S this week and slide into the driver’s seat was to catch a glimpse of the auto industry’s plans to soon let cars drive us, rather than the other way around. The updated Tesla, an already high-tech electric car that starts at about $75,000, was equipped with what the company calls Autopilot — a semi-autonomous feature that allows hands-free, pedal-free driving on the highway under certain conditions. The car will even change lanes autonomously at the driver’s request (by hitting the turn signal) and uses sensors to scan the road in all directions and adjust the throttle, steering and brakes. It is the first time that a production vehicle available to consumers will have such advanced self-driving capabilities. Or more to the point, the first time they will be unleashed for driving 70 miles per hour along twisty, though clearly marked, highways for long stretches. (Other manufacturers like Volvo and Mercedes-Benz recently introduced their own semiautonomous features, but limit the functions to lower speeds or require the driver to constantly touch the wheel.) And it’s perfectly legal. Among the states, only New York has any law prohibiting hands-free driving.\\n\\n\\nYahoo Mail Eliminates Passwords as Part of a Major Redesign:\\xa0Seven months after replacing traditional passwords with single-use SMS codes, Yahoo is taking the next step toward blowing up the password altogether. The company today announced Yahoo Account Key, which links your account to a mobile device and then asks you to approve new logins through push notifications. It’s part of a broad redesign of Yahoo Mail designed to make the service faster and easier to search, and also lets you use the app with accounts from Outlook, Hotmail and AOL for the first time. (No Gmail, though, at least not yet)\\n\\n\\nTwitter Courts Direct-Response Advertisers With New Reporting Tools\\xa0(Claims early tests show Promoted Tweets lift conversions) Twitter today unveiled an analytics feature called Conversion Lift that lets marketers regularly measure how Promoted Tweets perform in terms of conversions, which entail clicks, app installs or sign-ups for services. Interestingly, the feature also susses out if the ads persuaded someone to switch phone carriers, something T-Mobile\\'s social team is likely particularly interested in. To determine how effective an ad is, Conversion Lift splits a marketer\\'s target audience into two groups: people who saw a news feed-style ad and those who didn\\'t. The reporting then compares the conversion rates of both groups, including whether the action took place on desktop or mobile. Twitter said the tests, utilizing Conversion Lift, revealed that people who see Promoted Tweets are 1.4 times more likely to interact with a brand than those who don\\'t see an ad. What\\'s more, it said people who visit a brand\\'s website after seeing a Promoted Tweet are 3.2 times more likely to convert than those who visit the website without seeing one. Based on the data, Twitter then recommends ways for advertisers to more effectively target. For example, Twitter may advise an athletic brand that initially only zeroed in on sports enthusiasts to also target casual sports fans. \\xa0The Conversion Lift represents Twitter\\'s latest step toward convincing direct-response advertisers that it\\'s a good place to spend money. Late last month, Twitter rolled out its \\'Buy\\' button to all retailers and added video to its conversion-driving app installs in July.\\n\\n\\nGoogle Express Loses Another Exec as Wildfire Co-Founders Exit:\\xa0Victoria Ransom and Alain Chuard, the couple behind social ad startup Wildfire, are leaving Google three years and three months after the search engine scooped up their company. Talented people leave, join and stay at Google all the time. But Ransom’s departure is noteworthy because hers marks the third major exec exit from Google’s commerce arm in the past year. Ransom took over product duties at Google Shopping Express, its delivery service, after its director, Tom Fallows, decamped for Uber last November. Their boss, Sameer Samat, left for Jawbone in May. Then, in August, Google reshuffled the deck again, appointing its business development lead, Brian Elliott, as general manager for the entire Express operation, which has since expanded service across the Midwest as it aims to compete with Amazon and other delivery companies. The married couple arrived at Google in 2012 to some fanfare with the purchase of Wildfire, a startup that helped marketers manage spending on social platforms. It came amid Google’s feverish push to compete with Facebook on social. (The price tag was between $250 million and $350 million, depending on whom you asked.)\\n\\n\\nDropbox Announces Paper, A Google Docs Competitor:\\xa0Dropbox is going head-to-head against a very popular web app, Google Docs. Dropbox Paper is a collaborative document editing platform in your browser. It lets you edit a document in real time with your Dropbox contacts. Here’s how it works. Paper users can create a document and type text right away. Compared to Google Docs or Quip, it has very few rich-text editing features. If you want to format your document, you’ll have to use another word-processing app. In some ways, this is reminiscent of Etherpad. What if you want to add images and videos? You can browse your Dropbox and add a Dropbox link directly in the document. Paper will automatically change these links into images and videos. It also does the same with other web content, such as YouTube videos, SoundCloud songs and more. You can write todo lists, @mention people in the document to notify them when you need someone else’s feedback and also leave comments next to a specific paragraph. I called Paper a Google Docs competitor, even though it seems quite different with the smart embeds and mostly plain text approach. It looks like a white board more than a document creation platform. But then again, many Google Docs users already use the service to quickly draft something. So it’s unclear whether Google Docs users will switch to Paper to do something they can already do with Google Docs without the nice embeds. Paper isn’t available just yet. You have to sign up to a waiting list first.\\n\\n\\nMusic-streaming site Deezer files for $345M Paris IPO:\\xa0Deezer SA is seeking at least 300 million euros ($343 million) in a Paris share sale, valuing the music-streaming site at as much as 1.1 billion euros as it tackles Spotify Ltd.’s bigger and better-known service and Apple Inc.’s more recent products. The initial public offering would value the French company at 900 million euros to 1.1 billion euros. Started in 2007 by Marhely, who quit school at 16 to work as a developer for Internet startups, Deezer had 6.3 million subscribers at the end of June, according to the IPO filing. The company, whose largest shareholders also include Leonard Blavatnik’s Access Industries, is smaller than Swedish rival Spotify, which has more than 20 million paying subscribers and was said to be valued at $8.5 billion in its most recent financing round. \\xa0As the competition in music streaming intensifies, companies are branching out into events and merchandising to make their services more appealing to consumers and artists. Last week, Pandora Media Inc., the world’s leading online radio service, paid $450 million for Ticketfly, a ticketing service. Deezer said Thursday it will partner with BandPage Inc. to include concert listings in artist profiles and alert fans to upcoming offers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSquare, the Mobile Payments Company, Discloses I.P.O. Plans - Lost $77M on revenues of $561M in H1 2015:\\xa0Jack Dorsey is about to get even busier. On Wednesday, one of the companies Mr. Dorsey runs, Square, the mobile payments start-up, made its initial public offering prospectus public, indicating it is close to a road show to sell stock to investors. The move follows an action-packed 10 days for the technology executive, who was named permanent chief of Twitter last week and who on Tuesday announced that he was laying off 8 percent of the staff at the social networking company as he tries to attract more users to the service. The disclosure of Square’s I.P.O. prospectus is set to quicken the pace for Mr. Dorsey. While the filing revealed that Square’s revenue jumped to $850 million last year, up 54 percent from a year earlier, losses increased to $154 million in 2014, more than in 2013. For the first six months of this year, Square lost $77 million on revenue of $561 million. That means Mr. Dorsey, 38, will need to sell a money-losing Square to investors when I.P.O.s — including recent technology offerings like Pure Storage — have been met with a lackluster reception. In addition, Mr. Dorsey faces questions about whether he can juggle his chief executive roles at Twitter and Square. Taking a company public and navigating the turnaround of another are each tall tasks on their own. Some critics have said Square’s core business does not make enough money to justify the lofty $6 billion valuation that it received from private investors. While Square said that more than two million merchants accepted five or more Square transactions last year, the company’s revenue is not as large as some other technology giants that it is often mentioned alongside. The filing also presented a rocky picture of a key partnership with Starbucks, the global coffee giant, which the two companies entered into in 2012. Square ended up losing tens of millions of dollars on the countless credit card transactions it processed for Starbucks customers, the filing showed. The deal, which is expected to wind down in 2016, will winnow away a significant portion of Square’s transaction volume.\\n\\n\\nSquare’s IPO Filing: It’s Complicated:\\xa0Square recorded revenue of about $560 million in the first half of the year, a 51 percent increase over the first half of 2014. For the same period, losses were about flat year-over-year at about $78 million. That doesn’t look great. But a more nuanced look at the numbers, stripping out the Starbucks deal, tells a story of a healthier core business with even a path toward, yes, profitability. As a result, Square is making the case that that deal doesn’t reflect its core business, and it is right: Square loses money on Starbucks transactions, while Square makes money on the transactions it processes for all the other brick-and-mortar businesses it works with. Additionally, the metric subtracts other costs associated with things like stock-based compensation that fast-growing tech companies often argue don’t reflect the health of their main business. In the first half of the year, Square narrowed its Ebitda losses to $19 million from $44 million in the same period last year. And in the second quarter of this year, Square actually recorded an adjusted Ebtida profit, even if just barely. That’s a good sign.\\n\\n\\nJack Dorsey owns 24.4% - i.e. a lot - \\xa0of Square:\\xa0No wonder Jack Dorsey wants to keep running Square. Dorsey, the payment company\\'s chief executive officer who also just took on the same role at Twitter, is the largest shareholder in Square by a wide margin, with 24.4 percent. The investment firm Khosla Ventures is the second-largest with 17.3 percent, according to Square\\'s registration for an initial public offering filed Oct. 14. Dorsey\\'s sizable stake indicates that he was savvy enough to keep control of the company he co-founded. Dorsey\\'s high-flying reputation as a Twitter co-founder helped him negotiate more favorable terms for Square than an untested entrepreneur trying to raise money could. Contrast Dorsey\\'s position with that of, say, Box CEO Aaron Levie. When the file-storage company filed for an IPO in January, the 30-year-old Box co-founder owned 4 percent. While that still makes for a nice payout, six venture-capital firms owned more shares than Levie when the company went public. Or look at Dorsey\\'s first venture, Twitter. Evan Williams, a Twitter co-founder along with Dorsey, provided the company with early financing, which helped him maintain a 12 percent stake by the time it went public. Meanwhile, Dorsey had 4.9 percent. This month, Dorsey was named \"permanent CEO\" of an ailing Twitter at the same time Square was prepping for an IPO. He\\'s said he can handle both jobs, but investors are wondering how that will play out. In terms of ownership, he\\'s got a lot more eggs in Square\\'s basket. \"There are so many incentives for him to just spend all his time on Square,\" Lemkin said.\\n\\n\\nAmazon Shutters Hotel-Booking Site After Six Months:\\xa0Amazon.com Inc. has shuttered its hotel booking site \"Amazon Destinations\" six months after its start, signaling the world’s largest e-commerce company couldn’t persuade many of its customers to book weekend getaways. The Seattle company introduced the site in April hoping to expand on its Amazon Local initiative connecting shoppers with deals close to home. The destinations site featured maps, lodging offers and information about restaurants at popular weekend getaways near Los Angeles, New York City and Seattle. Amazon Destinations stopped selling reservations on Tuesday, according to an announcement on the website. \"If you have a reservation, your reservation is valid and will be honored by the hotel,\" the site states. “We have learned a lot and have decided to discontinue Amazon Destinations,” the company said Wednesday in a statement. The business pitted Amazon against Web travel businesses Priceline Group Inc., Expedia Inc., startup Airbnb Inc. and others for a piece of the online hotel booking market.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nShopify partners with Uber to ensure same-day delivery:\\xa0Canadian e-commerce platform Shopify said on Wednesday it was partnering with taxi-hailing service Uber to help merchants deliver goods to customers on the same day in New York City, Chicago and San Francisco. Shopify said the UberRUSH delivery service will be available to its merchants in the three cities immediately. U.S. department stores such as Kohl\\'s and Macy\\'s Inc offer same-day delivery services via a tie-up with Deliv, an Uber-like startup that contracts drivers to pick up ordered items from stores and deliver them to customers. The agreement with Uber is the latest in a series of major tie-ups announced by Ottawa-based Shopify. Last month, it inked a tie-up with the U.S. Postal Service, making it more attractive for smaller U.S. retailers to use its software to power their e-commerce sites. Just prior to that, Amazon.com also made Shopify its preferred partner for smaller vendors that are seeking to sell their goods via the online retailing giant. Although the rapid delivery services appear to compete with Amazon\\'s own speedy shipping options, the tie-ups with Uber and USPS will not put Shopify on a collision path with Amazon said Brennan Loh, Shopify\\'s head of product partnerships, who added that smaller vendors would still look to sell their products via Amazon due to its much broader reach, in comparison to their own portals.\\n\\n\\nBehind the Failure of Leap Transit’s Gentrified Buses in San Francisco:\\xa0Leap, which raised $2.5 million from some of the industry’s best-known investors, charged riders $6 to get across San Francisco, nearly three times the cost of riding a city bus. Its primary draw was luxury. Each bus had a wood-trimmed interior outfitted with black leather seats, individual USB ports and Wi-Fi. The buses also offered a steady stream of high-end snacks, sold via app. The luxury vehicles were up for auction; Leap filed for bankruptcy in July. The end for Leap apparently came so suddenly that its founders didn’t have time to remove much from the vehicles. Inside each bus, sitting in an out-of-the-way parking lot near Oakland, Calif., was a state registration form pinned to the wall, a bundle of iPhone and HDMI cables, and a display case full of snacks. Among the choices were packages of That’s It — vegan, gluten-free, non-G.M.O. fruit bars — and organic, paleo Simple Squares. Leap is one of at least several dozen tech companies that have failed this year. Their deaths are illuminating; dead start-ups show us which investors’ theories are bogus, which technologies aren’t ready for prime time and which common ways founders overextend themselves. In particular, Leap’s death suggests one emerging cause of start-up doom, a problem that also did in the anonymous social network Secret: too close an association with Silicon Valley’s tech-bro sensibilities. Start-up deaths often go unstudied. Silicon Valley stands out for the way it embraces failure, and it’s true that the “We Failed!” start-up post-mortem note has become a staple on publishing sites like Medium. By the time of its bankruptcy auction earlier this month, which attracted only a handful of bidders, Leap was all but forgotten. In its bankruptcy filing, Leap reported that it made nearly $21,000 in the two months during which it offered service. That turned out to be less than two of its buses — which officials told me could no longer start — fetched at auction: One sold for $11,100, and another for $12,100.\\n\\n\\nTwitter has appointed Omid Kordestani, who until recently was Google’s chief business officer, as its executive chairman.\\xa0Mr. Kordestani, who has a reputation for affability and business acumen, could bring a level of calm and stability to Twitter, which has been plagued by management chaos it its nine-year history. A company spokesman said Mr. Kordestani was unavailable for an interview but said he would play an active role in operations, supporting the leadership team and helping with recruiting. His appointment is the latest in a series of quick decisions by Mr. Dorsey, who announced on Tuesday that Twitter would cut up to 8 percent of its staff. Mr. Kordestani was the 11th employee hired at Google. He joined in 1999, when it was a year old, and helped create its primary business of selling the ads that appear in Google searches. His original title was “business founder” and he oversaw Google’s first dollar of profit and built its first sales team. That model has since generated hundreds of billions of dollars and still accounts for more than half of Google’s annual revenue. Mr. Kordestani left the company in 2009 but came back last year after his successor, Nikesh Arora, quit to join SoftBank. As chief business officer, he was Google’s highest-paid executive in 2014, with a $130 million pay package that consisted mostly of stock vesting over four years. Mr. Kordestani does not appear to be a regular user of Twitter. Before his appointment, he had sent just eight tweets on his personal account. Some Twitter investors, most notably Chris Sacca, have complained that Twitter has too many board members who “don’t use the product.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter to Cut More Than 300 Jobs:\\xa0Twitter announced on Tuesday that it was laying off as many as 336 employees, or 8 percent of its work force, to streamline and refocus as it tries to find ways to attract new users to its social network. “We are moving forward with a restructuring of our work force so we can put our company on a stronger path to grow,” Mr. Dorsey, one of the founders of Twitter, wrote in an email to employees. “We feel strongly that engineering will move much faster with a smaller and nimbler team, while remaining the biggest percentage of our work force. And the rest of the organization will be streamlined in parallel.” The cuts, one of the first major moves by Mr. Dorsey since he was named chief executive, received a mixed reaction from Wall Street. News of the impending layoffs leaked out Friday, after the market closed, and Twitter’s shares fell nearly 7 percent on Monday. After the staff cuts were announced Tuesday morning, the stock rebounded briefly and ended the day at $29.06, up 1 percent. “Cutting 8 percent of your work force is a little jarring,” said Mark Mahaney, an Internet analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You don’t normally see job cuts at this early stage for growth companies unless there is something materially going wrong with the operations or the strategy.” Twitter’s work force has grown quickly in recent years, through acquisitions and hiring. As of June 30, the company, which is based in San Francisco, had about 4,100 employees, an increase of more than 800 people, or 24 percent, from the previous June. Twitter said Tuesday that revenue and adjusted profit for the third quarter would meet or exceed previous forecasts. The high end of the company’s previous forecast predicted revenue of $560 million and adjusted earnings of $115 million. The company said it would provide “generous” exit packages to those who are losing their jobs, including 60 days of pay for San Francisco employees, which is required under a provision of state law governing large layoffs. Twitter intends to take a pretax charge of $5 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter in connection with the layoffs. Demand for software engineers is intense in Silicon Valley, and former Twitter employees were quick to reach out to those laid off and urge them to join them at other companies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s not just Twitter: Snapchat is laying off workers, too:\\xa0Snapchat, the app that\\'s best known for its disappearing messages, is stepping back from creating Netflix-style original content. You might not have realized Snapchat was even in the business of creating scripted shows. But in a move that likely reflects its poor performance, the effort has been shut down — and now the 15-member team responsible for it is being disbanded. Among those leaving? Marcus Wiley, a former Fox comedy executive whom Snapchat hired to run its program planning and development. Snapchat\\'s \"Snap Channel\" was one of a number of content streams available on the company\\'s app. It appeared on the Discover tab, running alongside partner channels from CNN, BuzzFeed and ESPN, among others. As those companies ran their content on their Snapchat feeds, Snapchat itself produced shows such as \"Literally Can\\'t Even\" and \"Pillow Talk,\" a casual talk show set in a bedroom where the host and guests appeared on camera in their pajamas. Unfortunately for Snapchat, these shows weren\\'t enough to keep the channel going. After less than a year, the company made the decision to shut down the Snap Channel, a move that convinced Wiley it was time to go.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStarbucks Is Testing Coffee Delivery to Office Workers in the Empire State Building; Opens a \\'secret\\' kitchen on the ground floor:\\xa0ree weeks after rolling out mobile ordering in its U.S. stores—a service that lets people pay for drinks in a branded app and pick them up in stores—Starbucks is bringing coffee delivery to the office door. Today, the coffee chain launched its first foray into food delivery with a store on the bottom floor of New York\\'s Empire State Building, which houses 12,000 workers. The program—dubbed \"Green Apron Delivery\"—lets staffers in 150 offices order food and drinks through a website that only tenants in the iconic building can utilize, meaning that tourists will not be able to participate in the program. \\xa0The new store isn\\'t your typical Starbucks, though, mainly because you can\\'t walk inside. Instead, it\\'s more of a kitchen where baristas whip up a small menu of drinks and food. Once someone places an order, a barista makes the drink and delivers it to an office within 30 minutes. Through October, the delivery option is free, and it will cost $2 per coffee run starting next month. Starbucks was quick to emphasize its project in the skyscraper is only a test, but it\\'s the latest example of how the company wants to make digital ordering mainstream. Last month, the coffee chain launched mobile payment at 7,400 stores, and later this year, it will launch another pilot program in its Seattle hometown as part of a partnership with on-demand app Postmates.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn Boost to Uber, Ola, India Said to Issue Guidelines for Ride-Hailing Apps:\\xa0The rules, which aren’t binding, if implemented by the states will be a boost for Uber Technologies Inc. and its bigger competitor Ola that have faced bans in some cities such as capital New Delhi. This month China also proposed rules for ride-booking services that also ask operators to obtain licenses from local authorities and offer cars that are registered for commercial use. The guidelines, prepared by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, mandate ride-hailing companies obtain permits from respective state transport departments to operate in a region, the people said asking not to be identified before a public announcement. The states may set the maximum fares to be charged to provide a level playing field with taxis, according to the advisory. The vehicles to be offered must be equipped with a location tracking device as well as an emergency safety button. Drivers, who offer their services on multiple platforms, will need to have a commercial license and the company will have to obtain a police verification certificate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntel’s Earnings Beat: $14.5B Revenue Despite Shrinking PC Market Reflect Move to Cloud Computing; Shares Flat:\\xa0Intel’s net income for the third quarter was 64 cents a share, above the projections of Wall Street analysts. According to a survey by Thomson Reuters, analysts thought Intel would make 59 cents a share, down from 66 cents a year ago. Revenue was $14.5 billion, down slightly from $14.6 billion a year ago, and above projections of $14.2 billion. Intel shares were down about 3.5 percent in after-hours trading, in part because of a projected fourth-quarter dip in demand from cloud companies. Intel became the world’s biggest producer of semiconductors thanks mostly to personal computers, which eventually led to chips for server computers. Now, the new hot trend of cloud computing — data centers filled with tightly connected servers — is remaking Intel. On Tuesday, Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said that in the three months that ended Sept. 26, PC chips brought in $8.5 billion and chips for servers in cloud computing data centers brought in $4.1 billion. A year ago, PC chips brought in $9.2 billion and data center chips brought in $3.7 billion. Making PC chips is still a big business, but not the way it once was. The data center group also has much higher profit margins: Operating profit from PC chips was $2.1 billion, down 20 percent from a year ago, while data center chips had an operating profit of $2.1 billion, up 9 percent. Intel’s mix of cloud-computing customers shows how much influence is wielded by just a handful of big operations. Of 200 cloud company customers that Intel tracks, just seven take one-third of those chips: Google, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Facebook, as well as Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent of China. While the rest are now growing at twice the rate of the top seven, Ms. Bryant said, the big companies are unusually demanding customers, even designing their own chip modifications to make their global clouds work better.\\n\\n\\nFacebook Is Building Its Own YouTube Inside Facebook:\\xa0Facebook has started serving up billions and billions of videos to its users by placing the clips in their feeds, between pictures of your friends’ kids and stories about people who don’t have kids. But what if you wanted to watch a video on Facebook, without looking at kids or reading about them? Like you can on YouTube? Now Facebook is going to let you do that, too: The social network says it is testing a “dedicated place on Facebook for people to go when they exclusively want to watch video,” which will help “people discover, watch and share videos on Facebook that are relevant to them.” Just like you can do on YouTube, the world’s biggest video site. The parallels between the two platforms aren’t a coincidence, and Facebook’s announcement is one that video industry insiders have expected for at least a year, starting when Facebook began its video push in earnest: If Facebook was going to really take on YouTube for video viewers’ time — and, eventually, advertisers’ dollars — then it would have to offer an experience like YouTube, where you could go look for things you want, instead of waiting for Facebook to show you something you didn’t know you wanted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple loses patent lawsuit to University of Wisconsin, faces up to $862M in damages:\\xa0Apple Inc could be facing up to $862 million in damages after a U.S. jury on Tuesday found the iPhone maker used technology owned by the University of Wisconsin-Madison\\'s licensing arm without permission in chips found in many of its most popular devices. The jury in Madison, Wisconsin also said the patent, which improves processor efficiency, was valid. The trial will now move on to determine how much Apple owes in damages. Representatives for the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) and Apple could not immediately be reached for comment. WARF sued Apple in January 2014 alleging infringement of its 1998 patent for improving chip efficiency. The jury was considering whether Apple\\'s A7, A8 and A8X processors, found in the iPhone 5s, 6 and 6 Plus, as well as several versions of the iPad, violate the patent. Cupertino, California-based Apple denied any infringement and argued the patent is invalid, according to court papers. Apple previously tried to convince the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to review the patent\\'s validity, but in April the agency rejected the bid. According to a recent ruling by U.S. District Judge William Conley, who is presiding over the case, Apple could be liable for up to $862.4 million in damages. He scheduled the trial to proceed in three phases: liability, damages, and finally, whether Apple infringed the patent willfully, which could lead to enhanced penalties.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook adds dedicated shopping section in continued move into e-commerce:\\xa0Facebook Inc (FB.O) wants its users to shop for clothes and other products from their mobile phones without ever leaving its app. In an effort to move further into e-commerce and compete with Amazon Inc’s (AMZN.O) retail offerings, Facebook announced Monday it is testing several ad features that allow users to shop directly through its app. Few users make purchases on mobile phones because it is slow and cumbersome, but Facebook hopes to win over more ad dollars by smoothing the process. Mobile purchases make up less than 2 percent of all retail sales, according to research firm eMarketer. Among the new features are ads that take a user through a specific brand\\'s products without redirecting them to another site. For example, a user who clicks on an ad from a boutique could see an expanded page that displays numerous clothing items. Businesses on Facebook will also be able to display products for purchase directly on their own pages. And users will be able to purchase products directly on Facebook through a “buy now” button that will be more widely available. The 1.5-billion-member social network has also added a new section on its app that takes users directly to a shopping page where they can browse among numerous brands from a select group of small businesses that will gradually expand. “From Facebook’s perspective, they’re addressing a pain point for retailers,” said Catherine Boyle, an analyst at eMarketer. “They will attract serious ad dollars with this offering.”\\n\\n\\nDell buys EMC for $67 billion in largest deal in tech history:\\xa0Dell announced Monday it had reached a deal to acquire cloud computing giant EMC for $67 billion -- the largest acquisition in the history of the technology industry. The deal signals that Dell believes it is best to go big at a time when many older technology firms such as Hewlett-Packard are paring down and becoming smaller, nimbler companies. Traditionally known as a personal PC-maker, Dell has more recently set its ambitions on the high-tech business world and portrayed itself as an all-in-one provider of equipment and services. Dell and equity firm Silver Lake Partners said in a press release Monday that buying EMC, a major data storage company, broadens its appeal to those lucrative corporate customers. In 2007, Dell returned to run the company he founded and took the company private again in 2013 with backing from Silver Lake Partners. The EMC transaction is expected to close in the “middle of next year,” executives said on a call with analysts Monday morning. It will take time for Dell and EMC to integrate their businesses if the deal closes, Hewitt said. For one, he noted that EMC has carved its niche by offering comprehensive — and not inexpensive — software solutions to businesses, which is where Dell wants to go. But, he noted, Dell\\'s philosophy is deeply rooted in providing cost-efficiency. As Dell has struggled to adapt its PC business for the modern age, EMC has also been under pressure from activist investors to spin off its cloud and virtualization business called VMWare for more than year as its faced heavy competition from flash storage and cloud storage firms. It has also faced pointed questions about its \"federated\" business structure, which strung together three firms -- its traditional business, VMWare and its software development firm Pivotal. Analysts had formerly counted Dell, as well as HP, Cisco and Oracle, as potential buyers for the firm.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nSAP third-quarter operating profit beats estimates on mature markets:\\xa0SAP said third-quarter operating profit, excluding special items, rose to 1.62 billion euros ($1.84 billion), beating the most optimistic estimate among 14 analysts, with individual estimates ranging from 1.45 billion to 1.59 billion euros, according to Thomson Reuters data. Third-quarter total revenue of 4.98 billion euros was slightly ahead of the average expectation of 4.93 billion. Europe\\'s largest software maker said it was sticking to its outlook for the full year for non-IFRS operating profit of 5.6 billion euros to 5.9 billion euros at constant currencies, which represents flat growth to a rise of as much as 5 percent from 5.6 billion euros last year.\\n\\n\\nFinancing in the Dell-EMC Deal:\\xa0Under the terms of the deal announced Monday, EMC has negotiated a \"go-shop\" provision in the preliminary deal that gives it the opportunity to seek out other buyers. Yet analysts say that while the Dell deal may slightly undervalue EMC shares, it\\'s still a good deal. Shares of EMC rose about 1.5 percent during regular trading Monday. While the company will be a private concern after the deal is closed, a portion of its shares will continue to trade publicly. EMC investors will receive roughly $33.15 per share — they will receive $24.05 per share and a type of publicly tradeable stock \"linked to a portion of EMC’s economic interest\" in VMWare. Dell\\xa0plans to pay $24.05 a share in cash plus tracking stock in EMC’s prize holding, software maker VMware Inc., valued at about $9 for each\\xa0EMC share. EMC’s stock climbed 1.8 percent Monday to $28.35. Dell will add almost $50 billion to its debt load to complete the purchase, people familiar with the matter said, on top of the $11 billion it already is carrying. The combined company will be run by Michael Dell, the chief executive officer of the company he founded and took private for about $25 billion two years ago. He is financing the takeover with his MSD Partners investment vehicle, Silver Lake and Singapore state-owned investment company Temasek Holdings. He also is using debt, the VMware tracking stock and cash on hand. The deal will combine EMC’s dominance in devices that store data with closely held Dell’s No. 2 position in servers, the powerful machines that help companies handle big computing challenges.\\n\\n\\nImplications for the Data Center Business:\\xa0The deal will help Dell raise its profile in data centers, the modern factories of the digital age that house servers, networking gear and storage systems. EMC had 21 percent of the storage market last year, about twice what Dell had, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While Dell has been outperforming some of its rivals, the company is grappling with sagging demand for personal computers. During the third quarter, overall shipments declined 7.7 percent, according to Gartner Inc. Still, Dell was able to post a small gain of 0.5 percent while larger rivals declined.\\n\\n\\nImplications for VMWare:\\xa0EMC investors will receive roughly $33.15 per share — they will receive $24.05 per share and a type of publicly tradeable stock \"linked to a portion of EMC’s economic interest\" in VMWare.\\xa0VMware declined 8 percent to $72.27 on Monday amid concern that the creation of a tracking stock will weigh on the company’s valuation. Analysts at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. lowered their target price for VMware to $75 from $95. EMC rival Pure Storage Inc. rose 8.8 percent to $18.06, exceeding its public offering price of $17 for the first time since shares began trading Wednesday.\\n\\n\\nSilver Lake Had Explored Sale of Dell’s PC Business Ahead of EMC Deal:\\xa0Private equity firm Silver Lake, co-owners of Dell, last week approached Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and Huawei to explore the possibility of selling off Dell’s personal computing business, sources familiar with the matter told Re/code. But by Monday, Dell proposed to pay a combined $67 billion to acquire the data storage company EMC and its subsidiary VMware in what is the largest proposed technology M&A deal in history. It was not immediately clear if Silver Lake acted alone or if Dell was consulted. It is also unclear if Silver Lake or Dell would continue to explore a sale at this point. The approach comes as the once thriving PC industry grapples with declining sales. That’s partially why none of the parties that were approached engaged further. Nearly half of Dell’s annual revenue come from the PC business, or about $27 billion, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",
      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter Is Planning Company-Wide Layoffs for Next Week:\\xa0\\xa0Twitter is planning company-wide layoffs next week, according to multiple sources. It’s unclear how much of the staff will be culled, but insiders say it will likely affect most, if not all, departments. The downsizing comes at the same time Twitter is restructuring its engineering organization to make it leaner and more efficient, these sources say. It’s likely that many of those impacted by the layoffs will be engineers, which make up about half the staff. Those close to the company have argued for years that Twitter has become too bloated. It reported roughly 4,100 employees last quarter, more than double the roughly 2,000 employees it had in Q2 2013 just before the IPO. Twitter’s user base has grown less than 50 percent in that time. Of course, some of the growth has come via acquisitions — Twitter has made plenty over the past two years. But still, the feeling from those close to the company is that Twitter’s engineering team is much larger than it needs to be. The reorg also aligns with what Dorsey has been preaching for the last four months: That Twitter needs to be more focused. In June he told Re/code that the company needed to do a better job of “clarifying ownership” around projects, and he restructured Twitter’s product team in August to do just that. Now, it appears, the rest of the staff will be reshuffled, too. Update: Twitter stock is down more than 3 percent in after-hours trading on the news.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Is Said to Deactivate Its News App in China:\\xa0Apple has disabled its news app in China, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation, the most recent sign of how difficult it can be for foreign companies to manage the strict rules governing media and online expression there. The Apple News app, which the company announced in June, is available only to users in the United States, though it is being tested in Britain and Australia. Customers who already downloaded the app by registering their phones in the United States can still see content in it when they travel overseas — but they have found that it does not work in China. Those in China who look at the top of the Apple News feed, which would normally display a list of selected articles based on a user’s preferred media, instead see an error message: “Can’t refresh right now. News isn’t supported in your current region.” Greater China is now Apple’s second-largest source of revenue after the United States, with sales of more than $13 billion in the third quarter. That means the company is most likely taking a careful approach to delivering new content, like that on its news app, within China. Beijing generally insists that companies are responsible for censoring content inside China. In Apple’s case, that would mean it would probably have to develop a censorship system — most Chinese companies use a combination of automated software and employees — to eliminate sensitive articles from feeds. For now, Apple seems to be avoiding the problem by completely disabling the service for users in China.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow Do You Value A Company Like Uber?\\xa0I became interested in Uber after reading a news story in June 2014, which reported the company was being valued at $17 billion in its latest venture capital round. I posted my first valuation of Uber in June 2014, viewing it as an urban car service, with local (but not global) networking benefits. Assuming that it would increase the size of the urban car service market by about 40%, while preserving its low capital-investment business model, I valued Uber at just under $6 billion. While some in the VC community were quick to dismiss the valuation, I will remain grateful to Bill Gurley for a post where he took me to task for having too narrow a vision of Uber’s business model. In his counter narrative, he argued that Uber was not just urban (it could create inroads in suburbia), not just a car service (it was in logistics & transportation) and that it was working with other businesses to create global networking benefits. Since Bill, as an early investor in Uber with access to its internal workings, clearly knew far more about the company than I did, I revalued Uber using his narrative and arrived at $54 billion as the value that reflected the narrative. I was wrong about Uber’s value in June 2014, when my estimate of $6 billion was below the $17 billion assessment by venture capitalists then. Correcting for both my cramped vision and the changes that have occurred since June 2014, my estimated value today is $23.4 billion. I know my estimated value lags the $51 billion value that VCs are attaching to the company today. This may very well be a reflection that my vision is still too cramped to capture Uber’s possible businesses, but it is what it is.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSingPost Doubles Down on E-Commerce With U.S., European Services:\\xa0Singapore Post Ltd., which counts Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. as its second-biggest shareholder, plans to expand freight services and warehouses in the U.S. and Europe as Asia’s emerging middle class drives online purchases from overseas. The move comes as other postal companies in Asia also are looking to reinvent themselves. Japan Post Group, a $2.5 trillion behemoth that also function as a bank and insurer, is preparing an initial public offering and looking to expand internationally after buying Australian logistics company Toll Holdings Ltd. earlier this year. SingPost holds a monopoly on mail delivery in its home base, which accounts for about 80 percent of its operating profit, but is looking for new areas of growth as more people use mobile phones and access the Internet. Worldwide business-to-consumer sales could grow 34 percent to $675 billion in 2016 from last year as the global middle class grows, SingPost said, citing data from researcher eMarketer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDocuSign CEO resigns as company heads toward IPO: source. The chief executive officer of DocuSign has resigned, according to an internal memo, signaling a leadership change for a well-funded tech company that is on the brink of an initial public offering. Keith Krach, chairman and CEO of DocuSign, a San Francisco company that makes software to add legally compliant electronic signatures to documents, told employees in a memo the company would begin a search for his successor. Krach became CEO four years ago and has been chairman for seven. Sources familiar with the company say Krach will continue to have a significant presence there. He will stay on as chairman for at least three more years. He is also one of DocuSign\\'s largest individual shareholders. Krach will remain CEO until a replacement is named. A search has begun, and the board is looking at both internal and external candidates. The next logical step for the company is an IPO, according to the source who asked not to be named because the plans are confidential. DocuSign, valued at $3 billion, aims to replace one of the final paper-and-pen aspects of business transactions: the signature. It is available in more than 40 languages and about 188 countries. DocuSign recently closed a Series F funding round that exceeded $300 million and now has well over $500 million in financing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon plays a long game with AWS:\\xa0Amazon Web Services doesn’t just want to dominate the global business in selling computing online. It also wants to be the rarest thing of all in the technology industry: a long-lived company. Its strategy hinges on an unprecedented level of automation in computer programming and maintenance, coupled with offering new products and services at a rate none of the old-guard companies seem able to match. The idea seems to be to dominate not so much by the traditional “vendor lock-in” of hooking customers on proprietary technology, but by making itself the center of the styles and habits of cloud computing. At least some of its customers seem to think that will work. On Wednesday, Jim Fowler, the chief information officer of General Electric, said, “A.W.S. will be the trusted partner that will run our company’s information technology for the next 140 years.” That’s how long G.E., founded by Thomas Edison, has been around. Mr. Fowler was talking at the annual A.W.S. conference, during a session in which the company indirectly made the case that it would go after all of the existing customers of some of the biggest technology companies around. Among other offerings, A.W.S. plans to send customers machines that will extract an Oracle database, say, and send it to A.W.S. to be transformed to a cheaper cloud product. G.E. had at one point thought of building its own cloud, but it went with Amazon in part because of this know-how. A.W.S. also introduced a range of new technology products, including automated creation of mobile software applications, automated large- and small-scale data analysis systems in real time, and ways of building software that can be managed easily across the globe from a single location. There were, of course, also ways to make these parts fit together, mostly in automated forms that configured and managed most of the underlying technology. To work with it all, last week A.W.S. published a 56-page manual on how to build and run software in A.W.S. “Cloud is the new normal,” Werner Vogels, Amazon’s chief technology officer, said to a roomful of several thousand software engineers on Thursday. “This is how you will build your applications.” Certainly, a good part of A.W.S. software is open source, which means it could be used elsewhere, and companies like Microsoft and Google also have big clouds. But neither of them, nor IBM, which also wants the cloud business, created more than 500 new features and services last year, as A.W.S. did. That raises an interesting prospect. A.W.S. does not have a lot of the proprietary technology or onerous contracts that have traditionally held captive the customers of big enterprise software companies. Amazon may be creating a kind of casual lock-in of its own: All this automation, features and standardization of practices could mean that in several years most young engineers will know how to work in the A.W.S. system, but none other. That’s not exactly a hostage situation, but it would hold companies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook to Test Emoji as Reaction Icons:\\xa0Despite the billions of “likes” bestowed on Facebook posts every month, something has been missing: an option to express a different emotion. On Thursday, Facebook announced it will begin testing six new emotional reactions that you can convey with a simple emoji, similar to the thumbs-up “like” icon that the social networking service has made so famous. The six new emoji depict various expressions, from an open mouth to express surprise to a scowling red face for anger. The other four emotions are love, laughter, sadness and a supportive cheer. The new reaction icons will be available to most Facebook users in Spain and Ireland by the end of this week. Adam Mosseri, who oversees Facebook’s news feed, said the company would evaluate how people in those two countries use the new buttons and refine them, before expanding the rollout to the company’s 1.5 billion users worldwide later this year.\\n\\n\\nFacing China Slowdown, Alibaba and JD Find Solace in Russia:\\xa0Russia’s plunging currency hasn’t weened consumers off foreign goods. Instead, cash-strapped shoppers are turning to online retailers for imported smartphones, jewelry and clothes, giving an unexpected boost to Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. Alibaba’s AliExpress site posted a 40 percent increase in Russian visitors to 22 million in July compared with a year earlier, according to researcher TNS. JD.com, which gets more than half its sales from electronics and home appliances, started its first international site in June in Russia, exclusively offering devices such as Xiaomi Corp. smartphones for about $214. That’s less than half of what an IPhone or Samsung Electronics Co. model with similar technical specifications costs locally. Millions of Russians are sinking into poverty as the collapse in crude prices drags down the economy of the world’s biggest energy exporter, sends the ruble into a tailspin and cuts government revenue. In August, wages fell 9.8 percent in real terms and Russians now face significantly lower disposable income than a year ago. While the economy may be in recession, Russians are embracing deliveries from China. Some 80 million people go online in Russia, making it Europe’s largest Internet market by users, according to East-West Digital News. However, the number of Web shoppers is still about a third of that, compared with 70 percent to 90 percent in the U.S. and western Europe.\\n\\n\\nNetflix is raising its prices again.\\xa0Netflix announced Thursday that it will raise its prices again, this time by $1 to $9.99 a month, giving the streaming video service more money to develop original content. The price increase will take effect on Nov. 11 for new customers. Existing customers will continue to pay the current rate, $8.99 a month, until October 2016. Longtime customers who still pay $7.99 a month will hold onto that rate until at least May 2016. The change may reflect that it is getting more expensive for Netflix and other video distributors to secure deals for television and movie content. In August, Netflix announced it would not renew a deal with cable network Epix, costing U.S. subscribers access to some high-profile movies including \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,\" \"World War Z\" and \"Transformers: Age of Extinction.\" Rival Hulu quickly swooped in to make a deal of its own with Epix. The price hike will allow the company to offer more original content, said company spokeswoman Anne Marie Squeo. This year alone, Netflix introduced more than two dozen new series or films, including “Narcos,” a popular crime drama focusing on the life of Pablo Escobar and his Medellin drug cartel.\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft’s Mission to Reignite PC Sector May Be Taking Hold:\\xa0Shipments of personal computers fell nearly 11 percent last quarter, to the shock of almost no one. Sales have been declining for so long — 14 consecutive quarters — that it is becoming harder to remember a time when PCs ruled the tech world. Yet despite all that movement — or maybe because of it — something curious has emerged in recent months: optimism. “Initiatives like Surface and Surface Book have helped the industry wake up and say, ‘We’ve got to make the industry cool and sexy again,’ ” said Frank Azor, executive director and general manager of Dell’s XPS line of PCs. The stated reason that Microsoft got into the PC hardware business three years ago, with the original Surface, was not to put PC companies out of business. The company said the goal was to better illustrate the capabilities of its software, providing devices that would inspire PC makers to be more innovative. Analysts and industry executives say the strategy may be starting to work. Dell, which still sells millions of PCs, announced on Thursday several new machines that run Windows 10, a new Microsoft operating system. One of them, the XPS 12, is similar to Microsoft’s Surface Book, a “two-in-one” device that combines the keyboard of a traditional laptop with a touch-sensing screen that can be detached for use as a tablet. The Microsoft event on Tuesday, where the Surface Book was introduced, generated the kind of buzz from the tech press that’s normally reserved for an Apple event. Apple itself generated discussion last month about whether it has begun to imitate Microsoft by announcing a new big-screen tablet with a stylus, the iPad Pro. The Surface has been available with a big screen and a stylus for some time. \\xa0It remains to be seen whether these efforts will result in more sales. Microsoft has seen terrific growth in its Surface business, which has jumped to $3.6 billion in annual sales from nothing three years ago. But most other big PC makers have not been able to get customers to spend on PCs as they once did. PC owners are holding on to their machines longer, making do with systems that are good enough for their needs. At the same time, they are relying on mobile devices for more of their computing tasks. On Thursday, IDC, the technology research firm, said that global PC shipments declined 10.8 percent in the third quarter from the same period a year ago, slightly worse than the research firm had expected. (Another research firm, Gartner, had pegged the decline at 7.7 percent.)\\n\\n\\nAmazon launches platform to build apps for \\'Internet of Things\\':\\xa0Amazon.com\\'s cloud business, Amazon Web Services, has launched a service to help customers build applications to connect devices through the cloud, the so-called \"Internet of Things\". The service, called \"AWS IoT\", will allow factory floors, vehicles, health care systems, household appliances among other \"things\" to connect through cloud services, the company said on Thursday. The beta version of the service is available from Thursday, Amazon\\'s Chief Technology Officer Werner Vogels said at a company event in Las Vegas. The connection to the cloud will be fast and lightweight, making it a good fit for devices that have limited memory, processing power, or battery life, Amazon said.\\n\\n\\nTwitter Opens Up Its Amplify Video Ad Program:\\xa0Twitter just announced an expansion of its Amplify ad program that should make it accessible to more publishers and advertisers. Amplify is the company’s two-year-old program for video ads. Initially, it involved a direct and somewhat complicated relationship — the publisher would embed a short video clip in a tweet, then the advertiser would both include a short pre-roll ad in the tweet and pay to promote the tweet in Twitter. In the new, open version of Amplify, an advertiser no longer needs to work with a specific publisher. Instead, they choose a content category, then Twitter will automatically include their pre-roll ads in videos tweeted by relevant publishers. (Advertisers can also use Twitter’s other ad targeting capabilities at the same time.) This isn’t just about making the process easier for advertisers — it also gives publishers a monetary incentive to share their video clips on Twitter. We’ve heard that the revenue split is 70 percent for publishers and 30 percent for Twitter, and that publishers will be able to blacklist certain advertisers or categories if they feel like they’re not a good fit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSingapore Post, Like Amazon, Tests Package Delivery by Drone:\\xa0Singapore Post Ltd. is testing package delivery by drone, echoing attempts by Amazon.com Inc. to extend the commercial capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles. The company known as SingPost said a drone it developed with the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore carried a packet containing a letter and T-shirt on a five-minute, two-kilometer (1.2 miles) flight. This marks the first time any postal service has successfully used a drone for “point-to-point recipient-authenticated mail delivery,” it said in a statement Thursday. SingPost is looking to such unmanned aircraft as online transactions increase in the Asia-Pacific region and as Singapore plans to develop itself into a so-called Smart Nation through technology usage. There is “immense potential” in drone technology for last-mile mail and e-commerce delivery, Bernard Leong, SingPost’s head of digital services, said in the statement.\\n\\n\\nAn Amazon Rival, Jet.com, Eliminates Its Membership Fee:\\xa0Just three months after its introduction, Jet.com, the much-hyped rival to Amazon and Costco, has done a 180-degree turn in its business model by making its members-only shopping club freely accessible. On Wednesday, Jet said it would eliminate its $50 annual membership fee, but continue to provide better prices on items, along with high-quality customer service and free shipping on orders of more than $35, among other benefits. The about-face raises questions of whether Jet was struggling to gain the traction it needed to expand its business. But Marc Lore, the company’s chief executive, said in a blog post that customer response to Jet over a three-month free trial period had exceeded expectations. The average amount of items per order was twice what it expected, for instance, he said. While eliminating a membership fee may help expand Jet.com’s customer base, the move could diminish the company’s chances of turning a healthy profit. Mr. Lore had raised more than $200 million from investors to fund the site. In an interview with The New York Times, he had predicted that the company would take five years to grow to a point where it was not losing money on every shipment. The $50 membership fee would have been a major revenue stream contributing to Jet’s profit. Now Jet’s revenue will rely on raking in commissions on sales from retailers. Discounts for customers come from what Jet calls Smart Cart savings, which let shoppers lower costs by adding more products to their shopping carts, resulting in orders that are more efficient and cheaper to fulfill.\\n\\n\\nAmazon Seeks Cloud Computing Growth With New Data Products:\\xa0Amazon Web Services announced products Wednesday that give businesses new ways to transfer, manipulate and derive insights from data they store in the company’s cloud. The products span diverse areas of information technology from a business intelligence service named Quicksight, to security systems, to new tools to help people migrate databases from proprietary versions into free ones hosted within Amazon. The company also unveiled a new product, called Snowball, that is a hardware device that lets businesses securely transfer large amounts of data into the Amazon Web Services cloud. And Amazon announced a deal with consulting giant Accenture Plc to focus on corporate customers. The products and services shown at the company’s re:invent customer conference in Las Vegas represent a further expansion by Amazon into competitors’ territories, whether database vendors such as Oracle Corp. or business intelligence companies such as Tableau Software. The effort also keeps the pressure on traditional hardware providers, who are seeing their businesses slow as more of their customers opt for cloud computing offered by Amazon and others. Amazon’s Web Services division generated $1.8 billion in sales in the Seattle-based company’s most recent quarter and almost $400 million in operating profit. The e-commerce company created the AWS division almost 10 years ago, giving it a lead on competitors such as Microsoft, Google \\xa0and IBM. that were slow to release their own cloud services. In recent years that has changed. Microsoft is now a major competitor to AWS via its Azure service, and companies like Oracle are converting more applications to run in the cloud.\\n\\n\\nSnapdeal invests $20M more in logistics firm gojavas:\\xa0Jasper Infotech Pvt Ltd, which runs online e-com marketplace Snapdeal, has invested $20 million (Rs 131 crore) more in logistics firm QuickDel Logistics Pvt Ltd, which runs operations under the gojavas brand, it said on Wednesday. Snapdeal had first invested in gojavas, which was previously a part of Jabong, a lifestyle e-tailer incubated by Rocket Internet, in March this year. It had not disclosed the investment amount but said it has picked a minority stake in the logistics firm. “The company’s average timeline for delivering Snapdeal orders has reduced by a full 24 hours in the last six months and our teams have worked closely to come up with innovative solutions that are enhancing customers’ shopping experience on Snapdeal. With the freshly infused funds, our aim is to help gojavas become more successful and expand their reach,” said Rohit Bansal, co-founder of Snapdeal. Snapdeal said it has invested $100 million in the last six months to improve it delivery timelines by 70 per cent and it will invest $200 million more in next 12 months to strengthen its supply chain. gojavas will be using the capital for expanding its operations to 100 more cities within 12 months. Vijay Ghadge, COO at gojavas, said the partnership with Snapdeal has helped it become one of the largest independent logistics players in the country with a revenue run rate of Rs 500 crore currently. gojavas currently manages over 1 lakh sq ft of fulfilment centres and helps more than 400 companies reach consumers in close to 350 cities and towns in more than 3,000 PIN-codes. It claims to deliver over 1.8 lakh packages every day and closed FY15 with revenues of over Rs 200 crore. It was originally an in-house delivery venture of Jabong but later spun out as a separate third-party logistics firm.\\n\\n\\nPandora Buys Ticketfly, a Competitor to Ticketmaster:\\xa0Pandora Media, the biggest player in Internet radio, has moved into the ticketing business with an agreement to buy Ticketfly, an independent firm that competes with Ticketmaster and is popular with clubs and festivals in the United States and Canada. Pandora announced early Wednesday that it would acquire Ticketfly for $450 million, in a mix of cash and stock. The deal further expands Pandora’s interests in providing services to artists. Last year, it introduced a data system, the Artist Marketing Platform, or AMP, that shows musicians which songs are most popular on the service and where. And in May, Pandora bought Next Big Sound, another data service, which studies the listening and searching patterns of streaming music customers. Pandora, which has nearly 80 million regular listeners, said that its acquisition would benefit artists and listeners. The deal will also add a level of complexity to the sometimes delicate system of alliances in the ticketing world, which is dominated by Ticketmaster, a unit of Live Nation Entertainment. Ticketfly, which was founded in 2008 and was an early proponent of using social media and the web to market tickets, has become a popular choice for promoters that want to avoid the Ticketmaster system. Last year, according to its announcement with Pandora, Ticketfly sold 16 million tickets worth more than $500 million. Among Ticketfly’s clients are the club Brooklyn Bowl and the Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago. This year, the independent ticketing world was jolted when Ticketmaster bought Front Gate Tickets, another service popular with clubs, festivals and acts, a move that led some bands, like Wilco, to shift their alliances to other companies. Pandora’s control of Ticketfly could pose a challenge to Ticketmaster, particularly given Pandora’s history of using its user data for marketing. The company, which derives about 80 percent of its revenue from ad sales, has long pitched advertisers on its ability to identify its users based on their demographic data and listening habits — even going so far as to say it can predict its listeners’ political affiliation. “The combination of Ticketfly and Pandora will be a marketing and event discovery powerhouse.”\\n\\n\\nAmazon considering online TV service:\\xa0Amazon.com Inc is considering the creation of a live online TV service and has reached out to networks such as CBS Corp and Comcast\\'s NBCUniversal to express interest in carrying their channels, Bloomberg reported. The e-commerce giant\\'s talks with the networks are in preliminary stages, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Such a move would increase Amazon\\'s already growing presence in online video. Amazon currently offers an on-demand video streaming service similar to that of Netflix. Amazon signed an exclusive deal with former \"Top Gear\" host Jeremy Clarkson in July to present a new motoring show for its Amazon Prime subscription service. The company last month said it would launch six TV show pilots for its video streaming service in the United States, the UK, Germany and Austria for the 2015 fall pilot season.\\n\\n\\nIf Your Wi-Fi Is Terrible, Check Your Router:\\xa0Bob McConnell, a retired engineer, set up a new wireless router in his home this year to get faster Internet speeds. Instead, he got the opposite, with his iPad often getting no wireless connection in his bedroom. For days, he tinkered with the router’s settings, but couldn’t figure out a fix. “It was totally ruining my life,” said Mr. McConnell, who lives in a condominium building in Kirkland, Wash. “Things would work, and then the next morning they wouldn’t work again.” What Mr. McConnell experienced is a situation we call “Wi-Fi headache,” and it’s an ailment that many can relate to. The condition is rooted in the networking devices called routers that people install in their homes for Wi-Fi connectivity. Most routers are difficult to configure for anyone who doesn’t work in an information technology department. Jargony tech terms like 802.11 or dual-band add to the confusion when people upgrade a router or try to decide which one to pick. So to diagnose and cure Wi-Fi headaches, we teamed up with The Wirecutter, the product recommendations website. The Wirecutter put dozens of top-rated routers and devices through hundreds of hours of testing to pick out the best router for most people and come up with other recommendations tailored to different living situations and budgets. It also ran new tests for The New York Times to come up with best practices for getting a stronger, faster Wi-Fi signal. The bottom line: People with devices both new and old will see an improvement by upgrading to a recent router that supports the latest Wi-Fi standards. But they should be wary of buying a cheap router that isn’t any good, or spending too much on one that is too complex for their needs.\\n\\n\\nPure Storage Falls In Public Debut, CEO Optimistic:\\xa0Pure Storage, the enterprise storage company, went public on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday. After pricing at $17, shares traded down in its debut, closing the day at $16.01. CEO Scott Dietzen spoke to TechCrunch about why the company executed an IPO during what has been a lackluster year for tech stocks. “We were ready to be a public company,” said Dietzen. “We don’t worry about market conditions. Great companies can come out when it’s right for them.” The company’s IPO performance, slipping in its first day’s trading, isn’t big news. Other recent IPOs that have seen sharp declines in value following their flotation have performed more strongly. For example, Box, a tech company that went public this year, surged on its initial day as a public company. In the ensuing months, its shares have sagged. For industry watchers, any current public technology offering is a bellwether. The IPO cadence for technology firms has been infamously slow in 2015, causing concern among those both seeking liquidity for their investments, and executives worried about where their private valuation might square with the public markets. To underscore that point, Dropbox, a company that could formerly do no wrong, recently endured an embarrassing haircut. Pure Storage’s offering went off mid-range. It fell a modest 5.8 percent. These things are not the end of the world. But they may describe public investor uncertainty about the value of firms that are burning large quantities of cash to expand their top line. Box, MobileIron, and a host of others have endured related declines.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter’s Next Hail Mary, Project Lightning, Has Arrived..is Uncannily\\xa0Similar to Snapchat\\'s Live Stories:\\xa0Just 24 hours after Jack Dorsey officially took over as the new CEO, Twitter is finally rolling out Project Lightning, the multimedia update it has aggressively pitched for months, to resuscitate growth and get Twitter back on track with Wall Street. In many ways, Lightning is Twitter’s most important product update ever. The new product, which Twitter is now calling Moments, is the kind of product that will shape how Dorsey is remembered in his third stint at the company he helped create. A Moment is a group of tweets stitched together around a specific topic, such as the Super Bowl or a breaking news event. These Moments are curated by Twitter, or Twitter partners like BuzzFeed and the New York Times, and primarily exist within a new tab inside the Twitter app, although they can be shared as links within tweets as well. Moments tend to be multimedia-heavy, with lots of photo and video tweets included, although that isn’t necessarily a requirement. Unlike your Twitter timeline, in which tweets are typically read in reverse chronological order, Moments are constructed in the same way you’d read a book — with a beginning, middle and end. If you’re familiar with Snapchat’s Live Stories feature, which have become very popular with its users, you’ll notice some striking similarities. (Very striking.) The purpose of the product is twofold. For starters, it’s a way for Twitter to play to its strengths by creating more content and engagement around live events, an area where Twitter truly does dominate other social platforms, including Facebook. When you follow a Moment, Twitter will temporarily insert tweets about that topic into your feed from people you don’t actually follow; as soon as the event is over, you’ll stop seeing tweets from those people. There’s no easy way to follow a bunch of people talking about a breaking news event, for example, so Twitter is trying to do that for you. Twitter is also looking for ways to entice new users, and believes Moments may serve as the bait. Twitter can be underwhelming when you first sign up, admits Madhu Muthukumar, product manager for Moments. But if you can immediately follow a Moment — and all the important people contributing to that event — it’s easier to find interesting people and feel like you’re part of the conversation right away, he added.\\n\\n\\nBill Gurley on Tech Bubble: I’m a Pragmatist, Not a Doomsayer:\\xa0\\xa0Bill Gurley, general partner at venture capital firm Benchmark, has developed a reputation as the Nostradamus of Silicon Valley. He has repeatedly called out startups and fellow investors for over-the-top valuations, warning of an impending tech bubble. He isn’t ditching that reputation. “It’s kind of my responsibility to call it out,” the venture capitalist said at the Vanity Fair Summit in San Francisco on Tuesday. “If you’re in a car heading over a cliff and I say, ‘Hey, slow down’ — that’s being a pragmatist, not being a doomsayer.” New York Times reporter Nick Bilton, who moderated the panel, asked Gurley how he squares that view with the fact that Benchmark is among the venture firms priming startups with cash. Gurley’s retort: The founders he backs could raise money in any condition — and could do it even better when funding dries up. “Most of the great CEOs I work with want this to stop. They’re forced to play this game,” he replied. “Great entrepreneurs raise money in any cycle. When there’s less money available, the better entrepreneurs have the advantage.”\\n\\n\\nData Transfer Pact Between U.S. and Europe Is Ruled Invalid:\\xa0Europe’s highest court on Tuesday struck down an international agreement that allowed companies to move digital information like people’s web search histories and social media updates between the European Union and the United States. The decision left the international operations of companies like Google and Facebook in a sort of legal limbo even as their services continued working as usual. The ruling, by the European Court of Justice, said the so-called safe harbor agreement was flawed because it allowed American government authorities to gain routine access to Europeans’ online information. The court said leaks from Edward J. Snowden, the former contractor for the National Security Agency, made it clear that American intelligence agencies had almost unfettered access to the data, infringing on Europeans’ rights to privacy. The court said data protection regulators in each of the European Union’s 28 countries should have oversight over how companies collect and use online information of their countries’ citizens. European countries have widely varying stances toward privacy. Data protection advocates hailed the ruling. Industry executives and trade groups, though, said the decision left a huge amount of uncertainty for big companies, many of which rely on the easy flow of data for lucrative businesses like online advertising. They called on the European Commission to complete a new safe harbor agreement with the United States, a deal that has been negotiated for more than two years and could limit the fallout from the court’s decision. Some European officials and many of the big technology companies, including Facebook and Microsoft, tried to play down the impact of the ruling. The companies kept their services running, saying that other agreements with the European Union should provide an adequate legal foundation. But those other agreements are now expected to be examined and questioned by some of Europe’s national privacy watchdogs. The potential inquiries could make it hard for companies to transfer Europeans’ information overseas under the current data arrangements. And the ruling appeared to leave smaller companies with fewer legal resources vulnerable to potential privacy violations. “We can’t assume that anything is now safe,” Brian Hengesbaugh, a privacy lawyer with Baker & McKenzie in Chicago who helped to negotiate the original safe harbor agreement. “The ruling is so sweepingly broad that any mechanism used to transfer data from Europe could be under threat.”\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft is making its first-ever laptop:\\xa0Under the leadership of chief executive Satya Nadella, the message out of Microsoft has been one of collaboration rather than competition. Since Nadella took over in February of last year, the historically sharp-elbowed firm has seemed to soften. A humbler Microsoft emerged, putting a greater focus on helping consumers use its products on whatever device they wanted, rather than being its own cheerleader. But Microsoft showed that its competitive spark is alive and well Tuesday with the announcement that it\\'s making its first-ever laptop. The laptop, called the Surface Book, has a 13.5-inch screen and weighs 3.34 pounds with a detachable keyboard -- clearly putting it in competition with Apple\\'s MacBook Air and the many, many Microsoft partners who make the class of lightweight laptops known as ultrabooks. (So does its starting $1,499 price tag.) The Book can be used as a tablet or as more traditional laptop.\\n\\n\\nSamsung Electronics third-quarter profit guidance beats estimates:\\xa0\\xa0Samsung Electronics said on Wednesday its July-September operating profit likely leapt 79.8 percent from a year earlier, beating expectations and pushing the South Korean tech giant\\'s share price sharply higher. Samsung, in a regulatory filing, estimated its third-quarter profit at 7.3 trillion won ($6.29 billion), its first quarterly profit gain in two years and its biggest since the first quarter of 2014. This compared with a 6.7 trillion won profit tipped by a Thomson Reuters SmartEstimate poll of 30 analysts. Samsung\\'s shares opened 4.1 percent higher after the guidance release. Smartphone earnings likely improved from a year earlier, analysts said, partly due to the launch of new lower-end models and the August launch of the Galaxy Note 5. Semiconductor sales were also expected to be strong, driven by the launch of new smartphones including the Galaxy Note 5 and Apple\\'s iPhone 6S models. The weaker South Korean won likely also boosted profits, analysts said. Samsung expects third-quarter revenue to rise by 7.5 percent from a year earlier to 51 trillion won.\\n\\n\\nAdobe 2016 forecast disappoints, shares slump:\\xa0Adobe lowered its profit forecast for 2016 below analyst estimates partly due to a strong dollar, sending its shares down as much as 13 percent in extended trading. The Photoshop maker said it expects full-year revenue of about $5.7 billion and an adjusted profit of $2.70 per share. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $5.93 billion and earnings of $3.19 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In 2013, Adobe forecast an adjusted profit of $3 per share for 2016. The company is expecting a $200 million hit on revenue as a result of the stronger dollar, and a $100 million hit as Adobe\\'s \"last material businesses are transitioning to ratable revenue.\" Adobe has been switching to web-based subscriptions from traditional licensed software to help attract more predictable recurring revenue.\\n\\n\\nEtsy doubles down on manufacturing as it faces off with Amazon:\\xa0Etsy, the online store that made its name selling handmade crafts, is trying to stop merchants from defecting as giant rival Amazon.com Inc prepares to attack it on its own ground with a new site for artisanal items called Handmade. But Etsy\\'s policy of allowing sellers to use outside manufacturers continues to anger some of the smaller vendors of handmade items who helped make it successful. Even changes to that policy have done little to address the criticism or hold off defections, analysts and sellers say. \"Until now, Etsy sellers had nowhere else to go,\" said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities based in Los Angeles. \"But what Handmade at Amazon represents is a trip back in time to Etsy\\'s original vision.\" Etsy disputes that sellers had no other outlets, saying it knows that while about half of its sellers sell only on its site, the other half also use other venues - from craft fairs to their own websites. But on average, even those who sell in many venues make the majority of their income on Etsy, the company said. Etsy, launched 10 years ago, became popular as an alternative to Amazon and eBay, tapping into shoppers\\' appetite for handmade items. But since its April initial public offering, which valued the company at $4 billion, Etsy\\'s shares have fallen by more than 50 percent. And the company\\'s losses doubled in the most recent quarter due in part to rising expenses and the stronger dollar, which dampened demand for U.S. products.\\n\\n\\nFacebook Gives Viewers 3 New Ways to Engage With Their Favorite TV Shows,\\xa0Challenges Twitter for second-screen supremacy: Facebook is trying to steal some of Twitter\\'s thunder, aiming to be the first choice among second-screen viewers, people who watch TV and engage on social media at the same time. So, this morning Facebook—with its 213 million monthly active users in the U.S.—announced new tools aimed at helping TV producers better engage audiences during live broadcasts. \\xa01. Hashtag voting and polling: This feature should get broadcasters the most excited. Instead of being directed toward separate apps within a show\\'s Facebook page, users will be able to vote directly within a top-level post or comment. 2. Photo and video submissions: Facebook is giving viewers or aspiring contestants on competition series the ability to submit photos and videos directly to show pages. Those can be anything from video questions (Fox News used this to solicit questions for August\\'s GOP debate) to funny submissions for late-night talk shows or audition videos. 3. Custom icons: Taking a page from Twitter\\'s playbook, Facebook will create custom icons—much like Twitter\\'s custom emojis—for certain events such as the Oscars, the Emmys, The Bachelorette and sporting events like the Rugby World Cup.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter shares pop 6% as it names Jack Dorsey as its permanent CEO\\xa0but said it would look elsewhere for a chairman, seeking to allay concerns about its co-founder\\'s dual role as head of the mobile payments company Square. Twitter\\'s shares rose as much as 6 percent on Monday after the announcement, which ended months of speculation about who would take the top job at the microblogging service. Dorsey has been running Twitter as interim CEO to much acclaim since his predecessor, Dick Costolo, stepped down on July 1. Twitter is working to rekindle growth after its latest quarterly results revealed the slowest rise in monthly average users since the company went public in 2013 - a performance that Dorsey at the time called \"unacceptable.\" Some investors had expressed concerns about whether Dorsey could run both Twitter and Square, which he also co-founded. Square is expected to go public this year and Dorsey may have to devote substantial time courting investors for the IPO. But others say Dorsey, 38, is a more effective leader now than in 2008, when he was fired from his first stint as Twitter CEO. Investors and analysts have lauded faster product rollouts since Dorsey took the helm in July, including a widely available \"buy now\" button that allows users to make purchases directly through Twitter.\\n\\n\\nGoogle Told by Russian Regulator to Unbundle Android Search:\\xa0Russia’s antitrust regulator has ordered Google \\xa0to amend agreements with smartphone producers that it said disadvantage third-party applications on devices running the Android operating system. Mountain View, California-based Google is abusing its market dominance through Android, the regulator ruled last month after a complaint from local search engine provider Yandex, which has been losing market share to its U.S. rival on mobile devices. Google has allowed Android-phone producers to use its application store Google Play on the condition that they also pre-install services from the company, including search, and prioritize those icons on screens, the Russian regulator said Sept. 14. Yandex has said Android’s default options push mobile users to Google services, limiting consumers’ ability to choose such services from Yandex or other vendors. “To restore competition on the market, Google should amend agreements with mobile-device producers within a month and exclude the anti-competitive clauses,” Russia’s Federal Anti-Monopoly Service said in a statement on its Website on Monday. Yandex shares rose as much as 13 percent in U.S. trading and were up 7.3 percent at $12.17 at 12:40 pm in New York. Yandex’s share in Russian search fell to 50 percent in August versus 54 percent at the start of 2014, while Google’s share rose to almost 42 percent from 34 percent, according to LiveInternet.ru. Google may also face a fine of 1 percent to 15 percent of the revenue from the services where the violation occurred, according to the regulator.\\n\\n\\n‘Yelp for People’ App Founder Says Peeple Won’t Be ‘Shamed Into Submission’:\\xa0 An entrepreneur said she wanted to create an app that would allow people to be reviewed, the way restaurants or vacation spots are, and you’ll never believe what happened next. (Unless you’re familiar with the social web’s climate of Internet shaming. Then you probably can.) In what was perhaps a speed record for attempting to dismantle a product that doesn’t exist yet, angry people circulated an online petition to prevent the project, called Peeple, from ever making it to an app store. Sleuths at the website Snopes, known for debunking rumors, tried to figure out if the whole thing was an elaborate ruse. And the woman behind the app, Julia Cordray, insisted that Peeple was the real thing, and that it would proceed despite receiving a viral heap of negative reviews. Though it appeared to be offline Monday, a cached version of Peeple’s website offered people the chance to sign up for beta testing of the app. Illustrations showed users with number and star ratings, in the manner of Yelp, and comments under a user’s profile. On Monday, Ms. Cordray did not say whether a prototype was available or whether it had been made available to journalists. Though it appeared to be offline Monday, a cached version of Peeple’s website offered people the chance to sign up for beta testing of the app. Illustrations showed users with number and star ratings, in the manner of Yelp, and comments under a user’s profile. On Monday, Ms. Cordray did not say whether a prototype was available or whether it had been made available to journalists. \\xa0The cached site’s terms also say that users cannot remove themselves from the app. In the LinkedIn post, Ms. Cordray attempted to scale back some earlier assertions about the concept of Peeple: “You will NOT be on our platform without your explicit permission,” she wrote. “There is no 48 hour waiting period to remove negative comments. There is no way to even make negative comments.” In that case, the app would fall in line with a plethora of platforms that offer users the ability to opt in to the service and then review one another, making the app more like LinkedIn than Yelp. Comparisons have also been drawn to Lulu, an app that allows women to rate prospective male dates using hashtags like #motherslovehim (positive) or #longnails (negative). Lulu has seen its share of criticism, receiving complaints from men who say they don’t want to be rated without their permission.\\n\\n\\nLegal troubles, market realities threaten Uber\\'s global push:\\xa0Uber Inc\\'s aggressive global expansion is looking costlier and riskier than ever as the company struggles with regulatory and competitive obstacles in major markets. Just last week, the company faced a police raid on its European headquarters in the Netherlands, a criminal trial of two top executives in France, a ban on its services in Rio de Janeiro and proposed new regulations in London and Toronto that could cripple its services in those cities. The Uber Pop service, known as Uber X in the U.S., which enables people to offer rides in private cars, is now banned outright in most of Western Europe. In Australia, Uber is popular but mostly illegal, with several big court challenges looming. Meanwhile, in China and other Asian countries Uber faces increasingly powerful competitors and idiosyncratic local transportation markets. Uber has in some cases responded by moving into businesses like car rental - which could be viewed as a nimble response to local conditions or a risky move into a low-margin, capital intensive business. That\\'s on top of the challenge to its business model that Uber faces in its home state of California, where a class action lawsuit could force the company to treat its contract drivers as employees. Taken together, Uber\\'s recent troubles raise the question of whether the firm\\'s headlong drive for global market share, underwritten by more than $7 billion in venture capital investment, is a prudent strategy. It has moved far more quickly in its global expansion than any company in memory--it\\'s now in 60 countries after being founded in 2009 --and the cost and complexity of so many legal wars and subsidizing millions of rides in countries like China could tax even a company as wealthy as Uber. In the U.S. alone, Uber has been involved in at least 173 U.S. lawsuits since October 2012, a review of Westlaw dockets shows, while rival Lyft has been involved in 66 and lodging service Airbnb has been a party to just 20. As a private company Uber discloses little about its spending but one indicator of the scale is its $1.2 billion funding for its China unit in September. Leaked financial documents show Uber overall lost more than $100 million in the 2nd quarter of 2014. \"Uber is adopting the shock and awe strategy,\" said Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at NYU\\'s Stern School of Business. \"I think it\\'s a very high risk strategy.\"\\n\\n\\nSamsung Seen Tapping $55 Billion Cash Pile for Share Buyback:\\xa0\\xa0Investors in Samsung Electronics are watching their holdings plunge as new Galaxy smartphones get a lukewarm public response. With $55 billion in cash, the company may be poised to offer consolation. Analysts expect the world’s biggest smartphone maker to buy back shares as early as this month in an effort to return some value to stockholders. Removing more than $1 billion of stock from the market could prompt shares to rally by as much as 20 percent, according to the top-ranked analyst covering Samsung, potentially erasing their declines this year. Samsung has lost about $25 billion in market value -- roughly equivalent to a Nintendo \\xa0-- this year as sales of the S6 and Note 5 devices sputter against new models from Apple \\xa0and Chinese makers. A buyback would be just the second in eight years and may take the sting out of sliding market share and sales projected to hit their lowest since 2011. “A share buyback should happen anytime now because the earnings haven’t been performing well,” said Dongbu Securities’s Yoo Eui Hyung, who tops Bloomberg Absolute Return rankings for his calls on Samsung Electronics. The possibility of a Samsung buyback comes after the government imposed a 10 percent tax on chaebol conglomerates’ income unless their spending meets certain minimum levels. The measures are aimed at pushing chaebol to increase salaries and boost investment.\\n\\n\\nReport: Google Invests In Wall Street Messaging Tool Symphony:\\xa0Google has participated in a new round of funding for Symphony Communication Services, valuing the company at $650 million, reports Dow Jones. The deal is expected to close this week. Launched last year, the Palo Alto-based messaging service has previously received financing from Wall Street giants including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and BlackRock. Symphony hopes its communications software will compete with Bloomberg’s financial terminal business, by providing news and research from Dow Jones. Symphony built a cloud communications service, which is compliant with FINRA and Sarbanes-Oxley, no easy task. Of course, you can have Slack-like conversations and create virtual discussion rooms, both public and private, but the trick is that there are special rules around who can talk to whom and the system has to respect the rules. Users can also do things like follow certain subjects via a hashtag system, so they can easily track a particular industry within the platform by setting up a set of rules, allowing people to track content, conversations and public social chatter about subjects that matter to them. The product is actually available for free for anyone who wants to use it as of last month, but if a company wants the all of the security and tracking ability, of course, they will need to buy the enterprise version. It’s possible that Google sees the potential of this tool beyond the financial services industry and that’s why it’s investing in the company at this point. Secure communication with the ability to track content could have wide reaching use for both consumers and businesses alike and Google could want a piece of that action. In July, the Wall Street Journal reported that Symphony was looking to raise funding at up to a $1 billion valuation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter stopping Product Ads, Amazon discontinues recently-launched Text Ads:\\xa0As of October 31, Amazon’s recently launched Text Ads program will be RIP-status. Yesterday afternoon, Amazon notified its advertisers via email that the Amazon Text Ads (ATA) program will be discontinued on October 31 — ironically, the same day that Amazon Product Ads also get the boot. Let’s back up. ATA ExampleThroughout the past year, you may have noticed text-based ads within Amazon search results and product listings. The Amazon Text Ads program delivered content based on keywords used in Amazon shoppers’ browser searches. This past August, Amazon used the sunset announcement of its popular Product Ads advertising format to introduce Text Ads as a possible alternative. The program has been in beta since Q4 2014 but will never see a public debut. It’s important to note that Amazon’s Text Ads and Product Ads take shoppers off Amazon and to the advertiser’s website. Is Amazon discontinuing these programs in an attempt to keep shoppers within the Amazon ecosystem? What does this mean for its remaining advertising program, Sponsored Products (with auction-based, keyword-driven ads promoting your Amazon listings when you have the Buy Box)? No one can say for sure. However, we recently caught sight of Sponsored Products in a new location on the Amazon webpage, which makes us think that Amazon is possibly working to improve this channel to help sellers promote their products on the marketplace. \\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nGoogle Inc has morphed into Alphabet Inc.: After U.S. markets closed on Friday, Alphabet replaced Google as the publicly traded company that will house Google\\'s search and Web advertising businesses, maps, YouTube and its \"moonshot\" ventures such as driverless cars. Google\\'s class A shares and class C shares will automatically convert into the same number of Alphabet class A shares and class C shares and start trading on the Nasdaq from Monday. The ticker symbols will not change. The core businesses will be called Google and operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alphabet. Sundar Pichai will head Google. Alphabet will be run by Google co-founder Larry Page and each of its businesses will have its own chief executive. Starting from the company\\'s fourth quarter in January, Alphabet will have two reporting units - Google and all other Alphabet businesses taken as a whole.\\n\\n\\nAmazon to Stop Selling Apple TV and Chromecast:\\xa0\\xa0Amazon said on Thursday that it would stop selling devices from Apple and Google that compete with its own streaming media players, escalating the entertainment battle between the major tech companies. Apple TV and Google’s Chromecast are popular items in Amazon’s electronics store. But the devices are in a brawl for market share with Amazon’s Fire TV and Fire TV Stick, which were introduced in 2014. The Fire Stick delivers Amazon’s rapidly expanding video offerings to its customers. Apple TV and Chromecast do not. Amazon’s move to ban competitors is not a retailing gambit. In fact, the company is willing to risk annoying customers who cannot get what they want because it is pursuing a much bigger prize. The stick is crucial to Amazon’s ambitions to move from being just a retailer to a multifaceted provider of everything virtual and physical. “It’s unlike Amazon to be this territorial,” said James McQuivey, an analyst with the research firm Forrester. But he said it was a logical and perhaps inevitable move.\\n\\n\\nFacebook Expands Mobile Video Feature That Helps Content Creators Make Money\\xa055% of ad revenue in curated video feeds goes to creators: In July Facebook made a big move into YouTube\\'s turf with plans to launch Suggested Video—a feed of curated video clips from brands like Funny or Die, the NBA and Tastemade. After a small test over the past three months, it\\'s now showing up in more mobile news feeds. Clicking on a video from a news feed leads to a page that pulls all of the publisher\\'s videos together in a stream, as well as other related clips. To help publishers make money off those clips, an ad appears between every few videos, similar to a commercial. Similar to YouTube\\'s business model, creators receive 55 percent of money sold from the ads while Facebook gets 45 percent. All video ads are sold by Facebook. The program is geared specifically for iPhone viewers, since a majority of Facebook\\'s traffic comes from mobile, to help publishers squeeze some extra money from clips watched from a smartphone. The stream pulls in video ads that brands have already bought, meaning that marketers are not paying extra money to get their clips to appear in the new section. \\xa0During a small test on Thursday and Friday, ads for Under Armour, Procter & Gamble, Taco Bell, Jet Blue, Target and KFC were playing alongside publishers\\' clips.\\xa0Just this week, Sheryl Sandberg pitched a room of agencies and brand marketers at Advertising Week on Facebook\\'s size as equivalent to a Super Bowl. \"What people are starting to understand is that what we offer is really broad reach—we have a Super Bowl on mobile in the U.S. every day,\" Sandberg said. \"Our data says that if you do TV plus Facebook, you enhance your reach by 17, 18 percent and more than double that for millennials, which is a hard group to reach right now on TV.\"\\n\\n\\nPew stuty of teen dating measures effects of social media and technology:\\xa0Ah, young love. Many of us may remember the intensity and ecstasy of puppy love. But how have those relationships changed in an era of constant communication, oversharing and emoji? That\\'s what a new study into teen dating, published Thursday by the Pew Research Center, explored in-depth. The study takes a look at how social media and technology weave into every stage of the dating process, from flirting to breakup. There\\'s a lot of digital flirting going on -- one boy said that his way of flirting is to put \"a bunch of emojis\" under a girl\\'s \\xa0photo. But asking someone out in person is still the most common way to start a relationship. Over three-quarters of teens said they\\'ve never dated someone they initially met online, though a quarter did admit they have dated (or hooked up) with people they met first online. One thing is for certain: if Romeo and Juliet had carried out their romance today, they probably would have avoided their catastrophic communication breakdown. Thirty-eight percent of teens who date expect to hear from their partners at least once per day; 11 percent expect to hear from their partner every hour. That doesn\\'t mean, however, that teens necessarily like this constant communication. Sure, many teen daters have used online messages or texts to resolve arguments (48 percent) or just engage in conversations that makes them feel closer to each other (70 percent). But 43 percent have also found themselves in situations where they think their partner is distracted by their gadgets during their alone time. The study also explored some questions of gender differences. Girls, for example, are much more likely to experience unwanted flirting, mirroring another Pew finding that women are more likely to be the victims of online harassment. Male and female teens, however, reported that there are definitely times when partners have crossed the line. Online tools can also exacerbate jealous tendencies, the study found, and 69 percent of teens reported that they think social media in particular gives too many people a window into their private lives. Many teens told researchers that pressure to post about their relationships made them present a less authentic picture of their lives. Others said they stayed away from posting too much about their dating lives online because it leads to \"drama\"; \\xa0one teen said it was because \"more people ask questions and stuff like that.\" Digital communication had its role to play at the end of relationships as well, researchers found, but in some ways teens were surprisingly traditional. Yes, there were slivers of teens -- 7 percent each -- that think it\\'s perfectly fine to break with someone by proxy or by just changing your social media status to \"single.\" (That\\'s cold, kids.)\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDaily Report: The Buy Button Heads to YouTube and Twitter:\\xa0On Tuesday, YouTube said it would make it easier for advertisers to pair their ads with videos highlighting a particular product. The new feature, available in the coming months, will allow viewers to get directly to a retailer’s site with a single click. No searching required. The new feature seems to be particularly appealing on the many videos of product reviews and tutorials, a type of video that has been growing in popularity on YouTube. It also, as Hiroko Tabuchi writes, brings “a shopping element to yet another corner of the Internet, as highly trafficked websites and social networking services increasingly fashion themselves into shopping hubs.” If there was any doubt about that trend, Twitter put it to rest on Wednesday. As Vindu Goel reports, the company is making it possible to put a buy button in a tweet. “A Twitter user,” he wrote, “can then purchase the product in as few as two taps — one tap on the buy button and a second to confirm the purchase.” It has been a big week for new online ad tools and features, several of which have been announced at Advertising Week in New York. As Sydney Ember wrote on Monday, Madison Avenue might still be the heart of the advertising industry, but much of the money — and influence — is coming from Silicon Valley.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore on the Twitter Buy Button:\\xa0Twitter Makes ‘Buy’ Button Widely Available:\\xa0After two years of testing, Twitter is finally making it easy for millions of merchants to sell products through a tweet. The social network announced Wednesday that its “buy now” button will be available to any merchant in the United States that uses one of three major e-commerce platforms to run its online shopping operations. A store that is a customer of Demandware, Bigcommerce, or Shopify can use the software to tweet out a link to a product that will show up with a buy button. A Twitter user can then purchase the product in as few as two taps — one tap on the buy button and a second to confirm the purchase. (The first time people buy something through Twitter, they will also have to go through a screen to provide payment and address information.) Twitter’s expansion of its buy button, which builds on a partnership with the e-commerce platform Stripe announced earlier this month, comes as competing platforms are also beginning to offer e-commerce directly from their services. On Tuesday, Google’s YouTube service announced that advertisers can now place buy buttons in other people’s videos — allowing, say, Apple to offer a way to buy an iPhone from inside a fan’s video showing the unboxing of a new iPhone (yes, there are lot of videos like that). Pinterest, Facebook and Instagram, a photo-sharing service owned by Facebook, are also testing buy buttons. Facebook isn’t so sure about Buy Buttons. Sheryl Sandberg, the company’s chief operating officer, said that Facebook studied the behavior of its 1.5 billion users and concluded that buy buttons should not be a high priority right now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore on the YouTube Buy Button:\\xa0YouTube to Expand Shopping Links to More Videos:\\xa0YouTube announced on Tuesday that it would introduce shopping ads on its videos that let viewers jump directly to retailers’ websites and buy the products featured in the clips. The video-sharing site, owned by Google, already lets advertisers show links to products within their own videos. But the new service would place product ads on any video on the site, like product reviews uploaded by amateur reviewers, provided the clip’s owner opts in. YouTube’s new ads bring a shopping element to yet another corner of the Internet, as highly trafficked websites and social networking services increasingly fashion themselves into shopping hubs. Sites like Pinterest and Instagram have introduced “buy button” functions that let users purchase the products that appear in the millions of posts and photos shared on their platforms each day. Google itself has pushed to become a shopping destination in an increasingly direct challenge to Amazon, currently the web’s de facto shopping search engine. YouTube’s ads seek to tap into the fast growth in product reviews and tutorials posted by users. Susan Wojcicki, the company’s chief executive, announced the change at an advertising industry event in New York. In the last year alone, viewership for product-related clips on YouTube has jumped 40 percent, she said. YouTube users have already uploaded tens of thousands of reviews of a battery-powered self-balancing skateboardlike device that retailers expect to be a hot holiday gift this year. Once the service is available in the coming months, videos from users who opt into the program, and which contain products that match YouTube ads, will display an icon in the top-right corner. Users can click on the icon to view a list of images and prices of the products featured in the video, and to jump to retailers’ websites for more reviews, information and an option to buy. YouTube matches videos with ads based on the video’s content and audience. Similar to YouTube’s AdWords service, advertisers pay only when a user clicks on a shopping ad. The site will test the ads this fall, and will offer the service to AdWords clients in the coming months, it said. For users who upload YouTube videos, the shopping ads could mean a new revenue stream, the sites said. And for viewers, YouTube promises an unobtrusive way to shop as they surf videos.\\n\\n\\nWhat it’s like to ride in a Google self-driving car:\\xa0Google’s cars have been trained to be extremely conservative in unusual situations. “They understand their own limitations,” said Dmitri Dolgov, principle engineer on Google’s self-driving car project, at a briefing later. “They understand that there’s something really crazy going on and they might not be able to make really good, confident predictions about the future. So they take a very conservative approach.” A few blocks away from Google I got another glimpse of the SUV’s cautious nature. A car, also with a stop sign, arrived at the intersection just after us. The Google car inched forward in two spurts. After a pause we drove through the intersection. We got through it fine, but slower than I expect most drivers would have. Soon we pull back in front of GoogleX’s building, a 14-minute ride in the books. “Manual,” calls out the female voice as our driver took control again, and turned the car off. If I was grading the SUV on our brief trek I would give it a B+. It wasn’t perfect driving, but safe and effective. Of course, our route wasn’t especially difficult. The real challenges come when pedestrians, inclement weather, construction sites and cyclists arrive.\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft, Google stand down in patent battles:\\xa0Microsoft and Google have agreed to bury all patent infringement litigation against each other, the companies announced on Wednesday, settling 18 cases in the United States and Germany. In another sign of the winding down of the global smartphone wars, the companies said the deal puts an end to court fights involving a variety of technologies, including mobile phones, wifi, and patents used in Microsoft\\'s Xbox game consoles and other Windows products. The agreement also drops all litigation involving Motorola Mobility, which Google sold to Lenovo last year while keeping its patents. However, as Microsoft and Google continue to make products that compete directly with each other, including search engines and mobile computing devices, the agreement notably does not preclude any future infringement lawsuits, a Microsoft spokeswoman confirmed.\\n\\n\\nSources: Jack Dorsey Expected to Be Named Permanent Twitter CEO:\\xa0Jack is apparently back — for good this time. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, who has been serving as interim CEO for the past three months, is expected be named the company’s new permanent CEO as early as tomorrow, although that timeframe may change, according to sources. Dorsey will apparently continue to run Square, the payments company he founded where he’s also CEO. [UPDATE: Sources said that it’s not clear if the board has officially voted on Dorsey’s appointment, because it was still settling the status of other key execs this week, most specifically revenue chief Adam Bain and CFO Anthony Noto. Bain is widely expected to become COO, although Noto may also report directly to Dorsey. Both have indicated to the board, said multiple sources, that they want Dorsey in the top job. The Twitter board also has what one source called a “Plan B” of a single serious outside candidate, although every single person I have contacted who has been considered and also contacted by the company’s recruiting firm, Spencer Stuart, said that discussions did not progress very far.] Sources added that there is likely to be some shake-up of the board too, most immediately the departure of Costolo as a director.\\n\\n\\nGoogle Is Acquiring Rich Messaging Startup Jibe Mobile:\\xa0Google said on Wednesday that it has acquired Jibe Mobile, a messaging startup that specialized in helping carriers build support for native video messaging into their services. The effort, designed to make video chat as ubiquitous and interoperable as text messages, is known as Rich Communications Services, or RCS. Google said it is making the purchase as part of a commitment to supporting RCS as part of its messaging strategy. “SMS carrier messaging is used by billions of people every day and enables people to reach anyone around the world, regardless of their device, carrier, app or location,” Android engineer and “minister of messaging” Mike Dodd said in a blog post. “However, the features available in SMS haven’t kept up with modern messaging apps. Rich Communications Services (RCS) is a new standard for carrier messaging and brings many of the features that people now expect from mobile messaging, such as group chats, high res photos and more.” Financial terms were not disclosed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

With this, Alibaba becomes a new investor in the Indian online payment and e-commerce firm. Two people aware of the details told ET that the Alibaba Group Holding will pick up about 20% stake through a fresh issue of shares by investing about $680 million(around Rs4,450 crore). The deal has been closed. In February, Ant Financial had picked up a 25% stake for $575 million, of which $200 million came in as the first tranche. The fresh investment by Alibaba Group Holdings subsumes the outstanding tranche of $375 million, and will see Ant Financial\\'s stake being lowered to 20%, one of the people aware of the details said.? Alibaba will now hold around 20%. With this, Alibaba will become the biggest shareholder in the company as it will hold 40% through two entities, and Paytm will be its ecommerce play in India. Under the financial contours of the transaction, existing investor Saif Partners\\' stake comes down to 30% from 37% while Paytm\\'s founder and Chairman & Managing Director Vijay Shekhar Sharma now owns about 21%, down from 27%.\\n\\n\\nGoogle Unveils New Chromecast, Other Devices to Connect Smartphone and TV:\\xa0Google on Tuesday revealed two new Chromecast streaming devices — one for televisions, another for speakers — along with a new tablet computer and a pair of new devices from the company’s Nexus line of Android mobile phones. Much like Apple, Google is pushing a future where televisions become a vessel for the Internet and channels are replaced with apps. But instead of having separate devices for music and TV, Google has tried to position the mobile phone as the center of everything — a kind of remote control for life.Enter Chromecast, Google’s popular streaming device that beams content from mobile phones to TVs via the Internet. The idea is pretty much the same as Apple TV, but Apple TV costs $149 and is essentially a small computer with lots of storage for apps to run on a television. Chromecast costs $35 and is just a waypoint between TVs and phones. The field of streaming devices has become crowded — Amazon and Roku make similar products. To distinguish itself from those stick-shaped competitors, Google’s new Chromecast is about the size and shape of a silver dollar. Google also announced that it had sold 20 million Chromecast devices and that it was now compatible with thousands of apps, including Netflix and HBO Now. For a company whose spotty hardware record includes Google Glass, the much-maligned Internet glasses, and Nexus Q, a streaming device that was never released, Chromecast is a huge success. So Google is expanding it. On Tuesday, the company also announced Chromecast Audio, a new line of Chromecast devices that plug directly into speakers and receive music sent from a phone. Google simultaneously announced a new partnership with Spotify, the popular music-streaming app that is in a battle with Apple’s new Apple Music offering.\\n\\n\\nHands-On With Google’s New Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X Smartphones:\\xa0Google announced its newest pair of Android smartphones, the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X. This is the first time since the Nexus line was launched, in 2010, that Google is releasing two phones at once. Each is targeted at a different segment of the market, but they both share a number of critical features for wooing customers. The 6P is Google’s new flagship, the successor to last year’s Nexus 6. The original Nexus 6 was made by Motorola (owned by Google at the time, though since bought by Lenovo) and was met with mixed reactions from critics and customers. It was big, the camera wasn’t as good as those in competing phones, and it was roughly twice the price of its own predecessor, the Nexus 5. The 6P is the first Nexus phone made by Chinese company Huawei, and it tries to fix what was wrong with the 6 while bringing a few new things to the party. The smaller Nexus 5X, manufactured by LG, is just over five inches long and has an ultrasensitive camera that is designed to work better indoors, where people take most of their pictures. It starts at $379 for an entry-level phone without a contract. The other larger phone, the Nexus 6P, which is made by Huawei, is 5.7 inches and starts at $499. Both phones use a new kind of charging cable, called USB Type-C, that powers up more quickly and has a symmetrical charging port so people won’t have to fumble to figure out which way to plug it in. Nexus runs what Google calls the “purest” form of its Android operating system. The devices come with a few Google apps but are otherwise free of so-called bloatware — software loaded onto a device by a phone maker — that can slow the device. Also, Nexus products receive monthly security updates and come with the latest version of Android, making them a kind of showcase for new Google products.\\n\\n\\nThe ‘Oh, Shit!’ Moment When Growth Stops:\\xa0Most high-growth businesses stare down periods when growth unexpectedly slows down or stops altogether. At some point, that stomach-churning moment has visited the leadership of most of the companies I’ve advised. We also faced it at OpenTable, eBay and Reel.com when I was managing them. And it has reputedly happened to a number of today’s mightiest Internet businesses as well, including the likes of Amazon and Facebook. CEOs at high-tech businesses work hard to keep as much growth going for as long as possible. Investors — both public and private — tend to value growth over everything else during most investment cycles, and the recent cycle has been no exception. Growth is where all the action is, and to where all the money flows. The reason for this is that the majority of returns are driven by a handful of companies that “break out.” And a business can’t get big enough to break out if it isn’t growing. Entrepreneurs’ reactions to these moments fall into one of two extremes: There is the preternaturally calm CEO who resolves to watch the metrics closely to see if they change; he or she is concerned that a hint of panic will cause the rest of the team to panic, so they “Zen it out” as best they can. Then there is the CEO who freaks out, setting off alarm bells that reverberate throughout the entire building and continue ringing in every single employee’s ears. Which approach do I advocate? The freak-out, of course! Why? Because the unexpected slowing of growth in a “growth” business presents an existential risk to the company. Growth rates over a company’s history tend to move only one way over time (down); even in hypergrowth companies, growth rates tend to fall to earth … which is why I’ve referred to this effect as “gravity.” Once gravity takes hold, it’s very hard to reaccelerate the growth of the business. Slowing growth portends a strong possibility that the company will never again experience prior levels of growth going forward. There are precious few examples of this happening on a sustained basis: Amazon accomplished it during 2010-2011, contributing to its value today. We accomplished this during my tenure at OpenTable, leading to a fourfold growth in market cap over six quarters. But growth will never resume magically. If CEOs can figure out what exactly happened to cause that slowdown, it presents them with the opportunity to try to correct what went wrong.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle launches ad format linked to Gmail:\\xa0During a presentation on Monday, Google announced a product that will let marketers target ad campaigns to consumers using their email addresses. The program, called Customer Match, lets companies upload a list of customers’ email addresses gleaned, for example, from its loyalty membership program. The company can show specific ads to these customers when they are signed into Google.\\n\\n\\nExclusive: Airbnb to double bookings to 80 million this year - investors:\\xa0Airbnb is expected to double its nightly bookings this year, investors familiar with the company\\'s performance said, a sign that the home and room renting site\\'s battles with regulators have yet to dent its rapid global growth. The website is expected to have about 80 million nights booked this year, up from about 40 million in 2014, according to the investors, who declined to be named. This pace of growth is expected to continue or accelerate, the investors said. The company says it has more than 1.5 million listings - homes, apartments, guest rooms, even houseboats and tree houses - in more than 34,000 cities in 190 countries. \"It\\'s a global phenom,\" said Keith Rabois, a partner at Khosla Ventures who made an early personal investment in Airbnb in 2010. \"(It) is going to continue to grow at a substantially higher rate than other businesses.\"\\n\\n\\nUber’s Chinese rival Didi Kuaidi invests in Ola:\\xa0Didi Kuaidi, which competes with Uber \\xa0for a slice of China’s taxi-hailing market, has invested an undisclosed amount in India’s largest cab aggregator Ola. The investment is said to be part of the recent $225 million funding round led by Ola’s existing investors Falcon Edge Capital, Tiger Global Management and Japan’s SoftBank. \\xa0Ola claims to complete more than 750,000 daily rides in the country while Uber claims to offer around 200,000 rides. Ola has set an ambitious target of reaching one million drivers on its platform in three years. Currently, it has over 100,000 drivers, a number that has grown from 10,000 a year ago. Didi Kuaidi was formed after China’s largest taxi-hailing firms – Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache – merged in February this year. Till date Didi Kuaidi has raised $4.4 billion in seven rounds of funding from marquee investors such as Alibaba, Temasek Holdings, Tencent Holdings and others.\\n\\n\\nYahoo to spin off Alibaba stake despite no U.S. tax ruling:\\xa0Yahoo said on Monday it would proceed with the planned spinoff of its stake in Alibaba even though the IRS has declined to rule on whether the transaction would be tax free. Yahoo\\'s shares rose 4 percent to $28.71 in extended trading. The Web search company said earlier this month the IRS had denied its request for a private letter ruling on whether the spinoff of its stake in the Chinese e-commerce giant would be considered tax free. Based on Alibaba\\'s Monday close of $59.24, Yahoo\\'s 384 million shares of Alibaba are worth $22.75 billion. The value of the stake is slightly less than Yahoo\\'s market capitalization of about $25.98 billion based on 941 million shares outstanding on July 31 and Monday\\'s close. Many analysts say Yahoo\\'s core business is worth close to nothing without its Asian assets. As of Monday\\'s close, Yahoo\\'s shares have declined a little more than 45 percent this year. Alibaba\\'s shares have fallen nearly 45 percent over the same period.\\n\\n\\nApple iPhone 6s Breaks First-Weekend Sales Record:\\xa0On Monday, Apple said it had sold more than 13 million new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus devices since they became available for sale on Friday, a record for first-weekend sales. That was up from the 10 million iPhones sold last year during the first weekend that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were sold. Any increase in sales was most likely helped by the geography of the markets where the new iPhones became available. This year, the iPhones went on sale in a dozen countries and territories, including China, which is one of Apple’s biggest markets. Last year, China was not among the countries that sold the iPhone on the first weekend, apparently because the devices had not received approval from Chinese regulators. Adding China to the product introduction more than doubled the initial market size, according to Walter Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG Research. Jan Dawson, the chief analyst at Jackdaw Research, said he also expected first-weekend sales to be higher than last year because the period for ordering the new iPhones before their sale date was longer than that for the previous generation of the device. The sales numbers slightly outpaced some Wall Street estimates. Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital, projected that Apple would sell 13 million phones on the opening weekend, and he said that Wall Street had expected that Apple would sell about 12 million. Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray had predicted sales of 12 million to 13 million. First-weekend sales help indicate overall iPhone demand, an important measure given that the device accounts for the majority of Apple’s revenue. The initial sales also are a marker for how well the new smartphones may do during the end-of-year holiday season, which is typically the most significant sales period for consumer product companies. This year, UBS estimates that Apple will sell 78.4 million iPhones in the December quarter, up four million from last year, while FBR predicts the sale of 77 million iPhones.\\n\\n\\nAs Online Data Theft Escalates, Banks Look to Retailers to Bear the Losses\\xa0On Sept. 1 last year, the website Rescator, known as the “Amazon.com of the black market,” alerted its customers that huge quantities of stolen debit and credit card data would go on sale the next day. “Load your accounts and prepare for an avalanche of cash!” the website urged. The next day, two batches of cardholder data were reportedly sold, according to legal documents. The website claimed the cards were 100 percent valid and working. Demand was so high that the website temporarily crashed. Over the next few days, several more batches of card data were sold. On Sept. 8, Home Depot issued a news release admitting its data systems had been breached. By then, the damage had been done. Approximately 56 million sets of card data had been stolen, some of which were sold on the black market and remained valid for several days. At a small credit union in California, fraudulent charges of more than $100,000 were posted in just three minutes after the card information was sold on the black market. A bank reported $300,000 in suspicious charges in two hours to the security blog Krebs on Security, which connected Home Depot with the stolen cards before the retailer did. A year later, the full tally of the Home Depot data breach remains unknown. Some estimate the fraudulent charges total well into the billions of dollars. Over the last couple of years, retailing has been a rich hunting ground for online criminals. They hacked into numerous companies, including Neiman Marcus, Sally Beauty and the crafts store Michaels. But the orchestrated theft at Target in late 2013, followed a few months later by the Home Depot data breach, eclipsed all of the others. So far, there have been no arrests in the Target and Home Depot breaches. As the size and scope of such attacks at retailers has grown, so have the losses, which have been largely shouldered by financial institutions. Now some small banks and others want Home Depot and those companies that suffer data breaches to pay.\\n\\n\\nGoogle Virtual-Reality System Aims to Enliven As Tech Majors Eye Education:\\xa0As part of a class last year on “Romeo and Juliet,” Jennie Choi, an English teacher at Mariano Azuela Elementary School in Chicago, took her sixth-grade students on a tour of Verona, the Italian city where Shakespeare’s play transpires. During the excursion, Ms. Choi asked her class to examine the variegated facade of a centuries-old building, known on tourist maps as “Juliet’s House,” where the family that may have been the inspiration for the fictional heroine once lived. She also encouraged her sixth graders to scrutinize the deteriorated tomb where they could imagine the Juliet character had died. But the students did not have to leave their Chicago classroom to take in the play’s Italian backdrop. Instead, as part of a pilot project for a new Google virtual field trip system for schools, Ms. Choi’s students tried out virtual-reality viewers — composed of cardboard and a cellphone — while their teacher used an app to guide them through stereoscopic vistas of the Italian town. The introduction of Google’s virtual-reality kits for classrooms highlights the growing importance of the education sector to major technology companies — and the mounting competition among them. In 2006, for instance, Google introduced Apps for Education, a bundle of cloud-based email, calendar and document-sharing products available free to schools. Now, 45 million students and teachers around the world use the apps, the company said. Microsoft has also developed a substantial school audience for its email, search, calendar, Skype and other software. This month, Microsoft introduced several new products for education customers, including a note-taking app called OneNote Class Notebook. But the advent of Google Expeditions is also indicative of an industry strategy shift. Some leading tech companies have recently made a decision to focus on designing products specifically for classroom use, rather than simply modifying their existing consumer or enterprise products and then marketing them to schools. Last year, Google introduced Classroom, a free app that teachers can use to create, collect and comment on student assignments. This month, Facebook announced that company engineers were working with Summit Public Schools in California on software to customize learning to individual students. Google engineers similarly worked with teachers to develop virtual-reality field trips based on course curriculums\\n\\n\\nAcademia Pushes A New Kind of Peer Review For Research With ‘Sessions’:\\xa0For several years, Richard Price has had a quixotic dream to make cutting-edge academic research universally available to everyone. “I want a world where a 19-year-old kid in China can access a paper he’s interested in about lithium ion batteries on his phone on the subway and it’s validated by others and it’s in his own language,” Price said. Price has amassed 25 million users on his platform, Academia, which disseminates and validates research papers. Now he’s trying to take it to the next level with a feature called Sessions, which is a form of peer review that exists entirely online on Academia. “If you speak to academics, they will complain about the publishing system,” he said. “It can take 12 months to get the peer review done. Our grand vision for the publishing experience is that an academic should be able to get work published in 24 hours that is already peer reviewed by two people.” Academia has been trialling ‘Sessions’ with a select number of members but now it’s fully rolled out, with as many as 6,000 sessions going on simultaneously every day. Sessions allows select groups of academics to privately discuss a working paper for 20 days. It tries to mimic the dynamics of a conference where a researcher discusses their work with a select peer group in a question-and-answer session. Price said that there were a couple of features that were absolutely necessary to make this work. One is that it’s private, so that comments are not searchable on Google and academics have the ability to respond to critics personally before they revise their work. The other is that it’s not just a comment box at the bottom of PDF. Sessions’ comments are on the right-hand bar of the page and they are annotations that refer to specific sentences of paragraphs (kind of like Medium’s commenting format). There is also a time limit of 20 days so that there’s pressure for other academics to respond quickly. Lastly, Academia is its own distribution network and it can pull in other relevant researchers to comment on a person’s paper. Instead of cold-calling or e-mailing dozens of people, an academic can reach out to other researchers who have high author or paper rankings. Conceptually, Academia’s Paper Rank is comparable to Google’s Page Rank with citations and linking built in as a form of validation. The company, which has 26 employees, has raised around $18 million from investors including Khosla, Spark Capital and True Ventures.\\n\\n\\nAre Marketers Finally Getting the Hang of Location-Based Mobile Ads?\\xa0Essence talks up lessons from Google work: Until recently, location-based advertising has remained a small part of mobile ad budgets, primarily because it\\'s difficult to pinpoint the exact person with the right type of ad on the fly. So, it was interesting that during an Advertising Week panel this morning about programmatic advertising, Essence digital agency and mobile advertising company xAd talked about their recent work for Google\\'s search app (which also won Adweek\\'s Media Plan of the Year award) as an example of how some initial hiccups led to successful place-based mobile ads. To promote Google\\'s search app, Essence ran a campaign that pulled in 23 bits of custom data—including weather, time, location and photos—for each ad impression to show how Google search results are personalized to particular users. According to Essence, the campaign generated a 53 percent engagement rate and boosted brand awareness by 9 percent. That said, it was also the first time Essence ran a campaign pulling in multiple pieces of data in real time, causing plenty of logistical problems early on. For example, just because the campaign was targeted toward cities including London, it didn\\'t mean the ads were actually served to people in London. With those learnings under the agency\\'s belt, Christina Yoo, associate programmatic media director at Essence, talked about how a new version of the location-based campaign is now using better targeting tactics alongside programmatic buying. \"In the beginning, one of our biggest problems was getting accuracy at scale,\" Yoo said. \"We want to have these perfect [location-based] experiences for the individual, but we also want to make sure that the information that we\\'re getting is accurate.\" After blanketing Google\\'s ads based on a phone\\'s latitude-longitude, the Essence and xAd teams drilled down into specific groups of consumers, targeting the ads by polygons—mapped plots of land—and mini data profiles about consumers. The mobile promos were also bought through programmatic private marketplaces.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook, eyeing TV dollars, rolls out new ad products:\\xa0Facebook introduced a slate of new advertising products on Sunday, most of which are aimed at luring television advertisers onto the 1.5-billion user social network. The advertising options, most of which will also be available on Facebook-owned Instagram, are designed to take advantage of the social network\\'s strengths on mobile devices. It has the world\\'s most popular smartphone app and generates more than three-quarters of its $10 billion-plus in annual ad revenue on phones. On television, advertisers can buy ads based on how many people they will reach, an approach Facebook has adopted to ease the transition between television spending and digital spending. In addition, it can target highly specific audiences, such as women aged 18 to 35 years old who have shopped on a specific website, which TV cannot do. Among the new products are \"brand awareness\" ads, which aim to reach a large number of people to promote a company\\'s name and brand, such as Coca Cola. Advertisers will also be able to poll users on mobile phones about whether they saw an ad -- a feature that used to be available only on desktop computers -- and they can use a format that allows them to display multiple videos at once that users can scroll through.\\n\\n\\nYouTube Is Prepping Its Subscription Launch: Two Services, One Price:\\xa0YouTube, which spent the first 10 years of its life as a free service, is getting ready to start selling tickets. Google’s video site appears to be finalizing launch plans for its long-in-the-making subscription service, and industry sources say they’ve been told to expect a launch near the end of October. A blast email from YouTube to content owners, telling them they have to agree to new terms by Oct. 22 or their “videos will no longer be available for public display or monetization in the United States,” helps support that timeline. But YouTube, which floated the idea of a new subscription service nearly a year ago, has never publicly committed to a timeline. Last spring, YouTube executives were telling content owners they were aiming for a mid-summer launch. It’s possible the launch could keep slipping, even beyond 2015. Note that we’re referring to a single service, not multiple ones. Sources say that’s because YouTube intends to bundle two different services into one offering: An update of its music service, which it launched in beta as YouTube Music Key last fall, and another service, yet to launch, that will give users the ability to watch anything on YouTube without seeing ads. Video industry sources say Google has told them it intends to charge $10 a month for the combined offering. It’s hard to imagine how YouTube will make money at that pricing, since its music service was supposed to cost $10 on its own, with the music labels and other copyright owners pocketing the majority of that.\\n\\n\\nIndia Replaces China as Next Big Frontier for U.S. Tech Companies:\\xa0Two years ago, India’s rise as a digital nation was hard to imagine. Internet penetration was modest, mobile phone networks were glacially slow, and smartphones were a blip in a sea of basic phones. Since 2013, however, the number of smartphone users in India has ballooned and will reach 168 million this year, the research firm eMarketer predicts, with 277 million Internet users in India expected over all. India already conducts more mobile searches on Google than any country besides the United States. Yet “we are barely scratching the surface of availability of Internet to the masses,” said Amit Singhal, Google’s senior vice president in charge of search, who emigrated from India to the United States 25 years ago. \\xa0India and its 1.25 billion residents have become the hottest growth opportunity — the new China — for American Internet companies. Blocked from China itself or frustrated by the onerous demands of its government, companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, as well as start-ups and investors, see India as the next best thing. The increasing appeal of India, now the world’s fastest growing major economy, was underscored in recent days. During a meeting in Seattle on Wednesday with American technology executives, China’s president, Xi Jinping, was unwavering on his government’s tough Internet policies. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, on the other hand, was on a charm offensive during his own American tour. After a stop in New York City, he headed to Silicon Valley, where he visited Tesla and attended a dinner with tech chieftains like Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Sundar Pichai of Google. On Sunday, Mr. Modi participated in a town hall discussion with Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive. He also planned to drop by Google and Stanford University, mingle with entrepreneurs and address a sold-out arena of 18,000 people in San Jose, Calif., before heading back to New York to meet with President Obama on Monday. ”For India to keep making progress, it needs to be a leader online,” Mr. Modi said during the Facebook event. He acknowledged that tech companies like Facebook were not connecting people out of pure altruism, but he told Mr. Zuckerberg, “I hope this will not just be something to enhance your company’s bank balance.” The overall message to Silicon Valley from Mr. Modi, who posts regularly on Twitter and Facebook: Help India become an Internet powerhouse.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSolving the Amazon Puzzle: In a battle of tech titans, some investors may have reason to prefer Bezos over Brin and Page.\\xa0Which company is a better investment, Google or Amazon.com? Conventional wisdom suggests Google, which turns huge profits, enjoys better gross margins, and has a far lower price-to-earnings ratio. Yet Amazon’s stock has returned 62.6 percent in the past year, compared with 9.6 percent for Google. That’s a phenomenon Steve Hanke, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University, and Ryan Guttridge, a fellow there, have named the “Amazon Puzzle,” and one they say they’ve figured out. The key is hidden in asset turns, or how effective companies are at getting revenue out of their investments. Asset turnover is defined as sales divided by total assets; the higher the number, the better. “Google is just abysmal, and Amazon is really good,” says Guttridge, who once worked for legendary stock picker Bill Miller at Legg Mason in Baltimore. How abysmal? Try 0.54 in 2013, 0.55 in 2014, and 0.53 so far this year, versus 2.05, 1.88, and 2.12 for Amazon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Guttridge and Hanke credit Amazon’s cash flow–focused CEO, Jeff Bezos. Bezos has a salary of just $81,840 a year, though he gets a further $1.6 million to cover his personal security. Beyond that, he receives nothing atop the return on the 18 percent of Amazon that he owns. It’s the same stock shareholders own. He makes money only if the stock goes up and must keep shareholders happy or be held accountable. Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google, while they earn only $1 a year in salary, control classes of stock outside investors can’t touch. That puts Google’s lucrative search and YouTube services further out of reach of the little guy. And that’s why Guttridge is betting on Bezos. “You buy equities because you expect to benefit from the free cash flow of the business,” he says. “With Amazon, you have a clear line between asset turns and cash flow.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nComing Soon to Checkouts: Microchip-Card Payment Systems:\\xa0Starting next month, retailers that haven’t upgraded their payment systems to read E.M.V. microchips — the small, metallic rectangles that are increasingly prevalent on the front of American charge cards — will bear the financial liability for some fraudulent charges. (Gas stations have an extra two years to make the switch for charges from their fuel pumps.) E.M.V. stands for Europay, MasterCard and Visa, the companies that created the standard in the mid-1990s.\\xa0The new technology is a significant change from the current system, under which card issuers absorb most of the losses for in-person transactions made with counterfeit or stolen cards. Banks and merchants lost\\xa0an estimated $16.3 billion\\xa0last year globally on fraudulent transactions, and America has been their biggest problem spot. The country accounts for nearly half of the global losses, despite generating only 21 percent of the worldwide transaction volume, according to the Nilson Report, an industry researcher.Visa drew a line in the sand four years ago: American merchants would have until October 2015 to update their systems or absorb the losses themselves. Other major card networks quickly adopted the same deadline.\\xa0Just days before the deadline, few merchants are ready.\\xa0A handful of national retailers — most prominently, Walmart and Target — have invested in E.M.V.-ready terminals and\\xa0spoken publicly\\xa0about the switch, but many others have stayed silent. Around 27 percent of American merchants will be ready to process E.M.V. cards next month, according to a survey conducted this month by the\\xa0Strawhecker Group, a consulting firm for the payments industry.\\xa0For small sellers, the readiness rate is even lower. Banks and industry groups estimate that one in five will have their new systems running by Oct. 1. Both systems will continue to be available during a lengthy transition period.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSoftBank Drops on Decline in Alibaba Stake’s Market Value:\\xa0SoftBank Group Corp. dropped to the lowest in two years as the market values of its biggest U.S. holdings, Alibaba and Sprint, plunged.\\xa0Billionaire Masayoshi Son’s mobile carrier and Internet investment company fell as much as 6.9 percent to 5,835 yen, the lowest since July 2013. The slump came on the first Japanese trading day after the lockup on Alibaba shares was lifted one year after its initial public offering.SoftBank has more than 1,000 investments, and its three biggest shareholdings of Alibaba, Sprint and Yahoo Japan Corp. have dropped by 700 billion yen ($5.8 billion) over the past 10 days to 8.7 trillion yen. Japan’s third-largest wireless carrier also slumped with rivals on concerns that revenue may weaken after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the nation’s mobile-phone rates were too high.\\xa0Alibaba fell for a fifth day Wednesday in New York, slumping to as low as $59.68, compared with its IPO price of $68.\\n\\n\\nPandora says has paid $500 million in artist royalties in past year:\\xa0Internet radio service Pandora Media Inc said it paid nearly $500 million in artist royalties over the past 12 months, bringing the total to more than $1.5 billion in about 10 years.\\xa0\"It took us nearly nine years to generate the first billion dollars in royalties, and just over a year to increase that total by 50 percent,\" Chief Executive Brian McAndrews said in a statement on Wednesday.\\xa0Pandora gets revenue from advertising and paid subscriptions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Risk of a Billion-Dollar Valuation in Silicon Valley:\\xa0Deep inside a Silicon Valley unicorn lurks a time bomb. It is a peculiarity of venture capital financing that the engine that pumps money into a promising start-up can later cause the same start-up to self-destruct. With all the hoopla and debate over sky-high valuations of technology start-ups, it is worth keeping in mind that the switch that helps to drive those surging valuations can also be turned off. The “bomb,” so to speak, is known as a liquidation preference. In every financing round, the money that a venture capital firm invests is not given freely. The firm and the start-up will negotiate terms of protection. Negotiable terms include voting rights, seats on the start-up’s board and assurances that a future fund-raising won’t unduly dilute the venture capital firms’ stake. The liquidation preference is among the most important of these protections. This feature provides that the venture capital firm’s investment will be repaid before the founders and employees are rewarded. If the firm has particular leverage, it can negotiate an even more protective form, known as the senior liquidation preference, which provides that the firm will be paid not only before the common stockholders but also before anyone else who bought preferred stock in earlier rounds. These provisions apply in a sale but not in an initial public offering of stock. The idea is to ensure that even if the investment does not perform well, the venture investor will still get back its initial money. According to a recent survey by the law firm Fenwick & West of 37 unicorns — private companies with valuations of $1 billion or more — every investment had a liquidation preference. Higher valuations create higher expectations, and failure to meet them can set off a downward spiral and a forced sale. In that event, the venture capitalists are paid first, leaving “unicorpses” in their wake and the founders with nothing. And don’t expect I.P.O.s to save these companies. Some unicorns, like Honest Company, have terms that require minimum I.P.O. prices for the V.C. investors that they just won’t be able to meet anytime soon. As these valuations go up and down, remember that reaching a $1 billion valuation is not all good news for a start-up. Instead, it can simply mean that the newly foaled unicorn has made a Faustian bargain.\\n\\n\\nInstagram Hits 400 Million Monthly Users, Mostly Outside U.S.\\xa0\\xa0Instagram has passed 400 million monthly active users, mostly by adding people in countries outside the U.S. That compares with Twitter Inc.’s 316 million and Pinterest Inc.’s 100 million. Instagram’s number increased from the 300 million mark reached nine months ago, according to the company. Facebook has 1.49 billion monthly active users. More than 75 percent of Instagram’s users live outside the U.S., with most of the new participants coming from Brazil, Japan and Indonesia, the company said. \\xa0As it expands, the photo-sharing application has started to ramp up its advertising business, taking advantage of Facebook’s network of tools and marketers to increase its offerings and global reach. At the beginning of this month, Instagram advertised in eight countries. By the end, they’ll be making money in more than 200, the company has said.\\n\\n\\nThe tech behind how Volkswagen tricked emissions tests:\\xa0Volkswagen isn’t hiding from its emissions cheating scandal, which the company now says affects some 11 million diesel cars worldwide. “Let’s be clear about this: Our company was dishonest with the EPA and the California Air Resources Board and with all of you,” Volkswagen U.S. chief Michael Horn said Monday night. “In my German words, we have totally screwed up.” Thanks for finally coming clean, VW. But how exactly did the technology behind Volkswagen’s so-called defeat device actually work? Regulators allege that Volkswagen installed software into its cars that allowed the autos to circumvent EPA tests. But that still doesn’t explain how VW vehicles were able to determine when they were being subjected to an emissions test in the first place. To understand more about how Volkswagen cheated, we have to know a bit about the EPA’s testing process. When carmakers test their vehicles against EPA standards, they place a car on rollers and then perform a series of specific maneuvers prescribed by federal regulations. Among the most common tests for passenger cars is the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS), which simulates 7.5 miles of urban driving. In the first 505 seconds of the test, the driver pushes the car to highway-level speeds. The second phase of the test looks more like what you’d see in stop-and-go city traffic. In all these tests, the driver has to stay within two miles per hour of the required speed at any given moment. Along the way, the testers collect emissions data. There\\'s a dizzying array of other tests that cars sometimes face. There’s a test to simulate aggressive driving, which tops out at some 80 miles an hour, and a test that simulates urban driving on a hot summer day, with the air conditioning on full blast. There’s a cold-start test, where you begin the test with everything in the car turned off. There’s a hot-start test. There’s something called a New York City cycle, which simulates driving in a busy downtown area where you never get above 30 mph. And then there’s the Federal Test Procedure, a 30-minute test that mixes various elements of the other tests. In the end, the detailed requirements for each test gave Volkswagen the advance knowledge it needed to teach its cars when to behave more cleanly. By measuring how long the engine was running, the vehicle’s speeds, and even seemingly esoteric factors, such as the position of the steering wheel and barometric pressure, Volkswagen vehicles could understand they were being tested and so adjusted their engine performance to pass the tests, according to the EPA. Using a special engine setting for vehicle tests isn’t all that unusual, according to Consumer Reports. Most new vehicles do something similar because otherwise vehicles might interpret some of the testing procedures, like traction issues from being on rollers, as dangerous. But the problem here is that the EPA says the carmaker used its testing mode in an inappropriate attempt to beat the system.\\n\\n\\nQuirky, an Invention Start-Up, Files for Bankruptcy:\\xa0\\xa0Quirky, an ambitious crowdsourced invention start-up, which raised $185 million from investors that included General Electric and leading venture capital firms, filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday. The failure of the company, based in New York, will surely raise questions about how far the crowd-based model of innovation and product development, made possible by the Internet, can go. Other companies are using crowdsourcing to make physical goods, from Threadless for T-shirt designs to Local Motors for automobiles. None, though, were doing it as broadly and across as wide a range of products as Quirky. The company said on Tuesday that it was seeking protection from its creditors while it arranged a sale of “substantially all its assets.” Quirky said that it already had an initial bid of $15 million for its Wink subsidiary, which was created last year. Wink makes software so that an array of Internet-connected home devices, as varied as thermostats and door locks, can be controlled from a smartphone app. Quirky had some success, with revenue rising sharply last year to about $100 million. But the scale of its ambitions — managing a sprawling community of inventors, transforming raw ideas into product designs, and orchestrating manufacturing and distribution — proved daunting and too costly.\\n\\n\\nThe Plot Twist: E-Book Sales Slip and Print Is Far From Dead:\\xa0Five years ago, the book world was seized by collective panic over the uncertain future of print. As readers migrated to new digital devices, e-book sales soared, up 1,260 percent between 2008 and 2010, alarming booksellers that watched consumers use their stores to find titles they would later buy online. Print sales dwindled, bookstores struggled to stay open, and publishers and authors feared that cheaper e-books would cannibalize their business. Then in 2011, the industry’s fears were realized when Borders declared bankruptcy. Now, there are signs that some e-book adopters are returning to print, or becoming hybrid readers, who juggle devices and paper. E-book sales fell by 10 percent in the first five months of this year, according to the Association of American Publishers, which collects data from nearly 1,200 publishers. Digital books accounted last year for around 20 percent of the market, roughly the same as they did a few years ago. E-books’ declining popularity may signal that publishing, while not immune to technological upheaval, will weather the tidal wave of digital technology better than other forms of media, like music and television. E-book subscription services, modeled on companies like Netflix and Pandora, have struggled to convert book lovers into digital binge readers, and some have shut down. Sales of dedicated e-reading devices have plunged as consumers migrated to tablets and smartphones. And according to some surveys, young readers who are digital natives still prefer reading on paper. The surprising resilience of print has provided a lift to many booksellers. Independent bookstores, which were battered by the recession and competition from Amazon, are showing strong signs of resurgence. The American Booksellers Association counted 1,712 member stores in 2,227 locations in 2015, up from 1,410 in 1,660 locations five years ago.\\n\\n\\nPayments Businesses Are Damn Hard:\\xa0The Cover App Edition: Cover, a young payments app, is accepted in 350 restaurants in four cities. It has processed more than $10 million in transactions since the beginning of the year. But it will record, at most, just $150,000 in revenue in 2015 after passing on a big cut of its fees to other financial institutions, its founder says. So go the economics of a young payments business. And so ends Cover’s life as a stand-alone company. Founder Mark Egerman said today that his startup has sold to European competitor Velocity in a small deal, after passing on taking on more venture capital under less-than-great terms. “Payments is really a hard business,” Egerman said flatly. Cover allows diners to pay for a meal by pressing a few buttons in a smartphone app at partnering restaurants instead of handing over a credit card or cash. The company generates revenue by charging restaurants 3 percent of the price of each meal. But, like many payment processing businesses, Cover passes along about two-thirds of that fee to banks and other financial institutions behind the scenes. So on a $100 meal, Cover’s cut is $3, but it only keeps $1 for itself. Then it has to pay for all of its expenses. If that doesn’t sound sustainable for a small, venture-backed company, that’s because it’s not. (Cover has raised about $7 million.) Cover’s fate underscores how hard it is to build sustainable payment-processing businesses without enormous transaction volume, and why even much bigger payments startups such as Square and Stripe are diversifying their product offerings to beef up profit margins and create new e-commerce markets. Square processes more than $30 billion in brick-and-mortar transactions each year, charging merchants a 2.75 percent fee for each transaction. Like Cover, it passes on about two-thirds of that fee to other financial players in the payments ecosystem, including banks and credit card companies. To supplement this business as it readies for an IPO and to live up to its $6 billion valuation, the company has unveiled a host of products to create new revenue streams with better profit margins. Its cash-advance business, Square Capital, was doling out $1 million a day as of August. It is also selling software products to merchants through monthly subscriptions — another avenue to move past the minor margins of the payments business. Stripe, the online payments company, has said it processes billions of dollars in payments, but it already has a $5 billion valuation. Its one and only revenue source is still the 2.9 percent cut it takes of most transactions, plus a flat 30-cent fee. It, too, is looking for new areas of growth from new types of commerce.\\n\\n\\nGroupon to Cut About 1,100 Jobs Worldwide:\\xa0\\xa0Groupon, operator of a daily deals website, said it would cut about 1,100 jobs globally as it restructures outside North America. Groupon is shutting operations in Morocco, Panama, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Taiwan, Thailand and Uruguay after exiting Greece and Turkey, the company said in a separate blog post on Tuesday. Groupon, which had about 11,800 employees globally at the end of December, said that it expected to complete the job cuts, mainly in sales and customer service, by September 2016. A strong dollar has hurt companies with a large presence in markets outside the United States. Markets outside North America accounted for about 43 percent of Groupon’s revenue in 2014. The company said in April it would sell a 46 percent stake in its South Korean business as part of its turnaround efforts. “I think it’s actually a good thing for investors to hear that they’re taking some more cuts out of their international operations,” Topeka Capital Markets analyst Blake Harper said. Groupon, once the leader in the online coupons market, has also been struggling to boost sales as competitive deals on online marketplaces operated by Amazon and eBay make its coupons less attractive to shoppers. The company has started selling products on its website. Groupon said it expected to incur pretax charges of up to $35 million, including $22 million-$24 million in the third quarter, related to the job cuts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber’s Carpool Version, UberPool, Lands in India Before Palo Alto:\\xa0Uber’s taking UberPool global, testing it soon in Bangalore, India. This is one of the first times the company has offered its carpooling version in another country (it’s also in France). Funnily enough, India will have access to UberPool before many suburban Uber markets in the United States like Palo Alto and San Jose. It’s possible the company plans to focus UberPool in dense cities, where it’s more likely to find matches between passengers heading the same way, instead of sprawling suburbs. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said recently at the Salesforce conference that UberPool isn’t as profitable as its original UberX service. UberPool in India might face some major challenges. GPS and mapping tools are a different beast in the South Asian country, where the city landscape changes daily, roads start and stop in unexpected places and businesses launch and disappear unexpectedly. With a population of 4.3 million — by comparison, San Francisco is at 1 million — Bangalore is known for major traffic issues. UberPool requires picking up people from different destinations quickly and efficiently so carpooling doesn’t add too much more time to a person’s commute. It’s a tough enough problem in the U.S.; navigating the maze of streets and traffic in India might be even harder. Uber will also be taking on its competitors — sources tell Re/code that Ola Cabs is launching its carpool version, Ola Share, in five cities soon. Long distance travel app BlaBlaCar, which offers a more traditional form of carpooling, is already live in India.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKickstarter Focuses Its Mission on Altruism Over Profit:\\xa0Many technology start-ups aim to become “unicorns,” the companies that get valued at $1 billion or more on their way to probable vast riches. Yancey Strickler and Perry Chen have no interest in that. As co-founders of Kickstarter, the popular online crowdfunding website that lets people raise money to help fund all manner of projects, including cooking gadgets and movies, Mr. Strickler and Mr. Chen could have tried to take their company public or sell it, earning millions of dollars for themselves and other shareholders. Instead, they announced on Sunday that Kickstarter was reincorporating as a “public benefit corporation,” a legal change they said would ensure that money — or the promise of it — would not corrupt their company’s mission of enabling creative projects to be funded. Public benefit corporations are a relatively new designation that has been signed into law by a number of states. Delaware, where Kickstarter is reincorporating, began allowing public benefit corporations in 2013. Under the designation, companies must aim to do something that would aid the public (such as Kickstarter’s mission to “help bring creative projects to life”) and include that goal in their corporate charter. Board members must also take that public benefit into account when making decisions, and the company has to report on its social impact. Kickstarter’s move builds upon its decision last year to become a B Corporation, a voluntary designation certified by a nonprofit group called B Lab. To become a B Corp, companies must meet rigorous environmental and social-responsibility standards, which they report annually to shareholders — though taking on the status has no legal impact. Other companies, including the e-commerce site Etsy, which went public in April, and Warby Parker, the eyeglasses retailer, have also opted to become B Corps.\\n\\n\\nChina cyber espionage is more than an irritant, must stop: U.S.\\xa0U.S. national security adviser Susan Rice on Monday issued a stern warning to China before President Xi Jinping\\'s visit that state-sponsored cyber espionage must stop, calling it a national security concern and critical factor in U.S.-China relations. \"This isn\\'t a mild irritation, it\\'s an economic and national security concern to the United States,\" she said during remarks at George Washington University. \"It puts enormous strain on our bilateral relationship, and it is a critical factor in determining the future trajectory of U.S.-China ties.\" President Barack Obama and Xi are expected to have an intense back-and-forth about the issue when the Chinese leader comes to the White House this week. \"Cyber-enabled espionage that targets personal and corporate information for the economic gain of businesses undermines our long-term economic cooperation and it needs to stop,\" Rice said.\\n\\n\\nZumper: One-Third Of San Francisco’s Rent Is Attributable To VC Funding:\\xa0Zumper, a venture-backed startup that focuses on creating a more efficient and transparent apartment rental marketplace, ran a study of housing costs in tech hubs across the United States. They’re arguing that one-third of San Francisco’s rents are attributable to venture capital funding. Last year, venture firms invested $49 billion across the United States. The vast majority of it, or 78 percent, went to just 10 American cities. The company looked at 3 million active listings across the United States last year. The study, done by the company’s housing economist and MBA student Andrew Duboff, isolated for factors including population, median household income, median home values, rental housing vacancy rates, and impact of local rent control ordinances. The Zumper study did not account for zoning regulations. “It was tough to isolate an apples-to-apples comparison for zoning regulations, so we ended up not including it,” said Devin O’Brien, who heads up marketing for Zumper. “That being said, vacancy rates does include a lot of this as a secondary measure. However, at the end of the day, we had an adjusted R-squared correlation of 0.83 for venture capital investment. It’s very strong.” Another study last year from UC Berkeley economics professor Enrico Moretti and University of Chicago’s Chang-Tai Hsieh argued zoning regulations are incredibly costly to the American economy. They found that if highly-productive cities like New York City, Boston and San Francisco had a more elastic housing supply, it could add 9.5 percent to the U.S. GDP.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple\\'s iOS App Store suffers first major attack:\\xa0Apple said on Sunday it is cleaning up its iOS App Store to remove malicious iPhone and iPad programs identified in the first large-scale attack on the popular mobile software outlet. The company disclosed the effort after several cyber security firms reported finding a malicious program dubbed XcodeGhost that was embedded in hundreds of legitimate apps. It is the first reported case of large numbers of malicious software programs making their way past Apple\\'s stringent app review process. Prior to this attack, a total of just five malicious apps had ever been found in the App Store. The hackers embedded the malicious code in these apps by convincing developers of legitimate software to use a tainted, counterfeit version of Apple\\'s software for creating iOS and Mac apps, which is known as Xcode, Apple said. Palo Alto Networks Director of Threat Intelligence Ryan Olson said the malware had limited functionality and his firm had uncovered no examples of data theft or other harm as a result of the attack. Still, he said it was \"a pretty big deal\" because it showed that the App Store could be compromised if hackers infected machines of software developers writing legitimate apps. Other attackers may copy that approach, which is hard to defend against, he said. Researchers said infected apps included Tencent\\'s popular mobile chat app WeChat, car-hailing app Didi Kuaidi and a music app from Internet portal NetEase. The tainted version of Xcode was downloaded from a server in China that developers may have used because it allowed for faster downloads than using Apple\\'s U.S. servers, Olson said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCheap robots may shift car making from China to U.S.: Magna CEO.\\xa0The falling cost of intelligent robots may help repatriate some car manufacturing work away from low-cost locations like China back to factories in Germany and North America, Donald Walker, Chief Executive of auto supplier Magna told Reuters. Rising wages in China and the cost of importing heavy components like electric car batteries into Europe may lead established car makers to introduce more highly efficient automated manufacturing closer to home, Walker told Reuters in an interview at the Frankfurt auto show. \"If you have a high labor, easy-to-ship part, it has already gone, for the most part, to a low-cost jurisdiction,\" Walker said about the evolution of assembly work in the car manufacturing business. \"A bigger issue is how fast do you have intelligent robotics replace manual labor everywhere in the world,\" Walker said. By 2025 the total cost of manufacturing labor is projected to fall between 18 and 33 percent in countries which already deploy industrial robots, including South Korea, China, the U.S. Germany and Japan, a study on advanced manufacturing technologies by the Boston Consulting Group showed.\\n\\n\\nAmazon Wins First Emmy for \\'Transparent\\':\\xa0Jeffrey Tambor and Jill Soloway delivered Amazon.com its first major Emmy awards for the show “Transparent,” as the online retailer went toe-to-toe with Time Warner’s HBO in the comedy categories. Tambor plays the patriarch of a Los Angeles family who reveals to his children that he has long felt he’s a woman and is going to begin to dress like one. Soloway created “Transparent” and won an award for directing, one of 11 nominations the show received.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom EyeEm, Technology to See and Tag Photos:\\xa0\\xa0A little-known German start-up may have just made it a lot easier to search for photos online. EyeEm, a photo-sharing service started in 2011 that has drawn parallels to Instagram, announced new technology in Brooklyn on Friday that uses a sophisticated algorithm and machine learning to analyze the details of online photos. The technology, called EyeVision, automatically scans images and tags them with certain keywords, from “landscape” and “New York” to the perceived emotions of people in each photo, which makes them easier to find through web searches. While other companies have tried similar techniques to categorize online images, the German start-up’s efforts — which comes after roughly three years of development — are based on analyzing millions of photos already shared on EyeEm’s photo-sharing social network. The company has roughly 15 million users compared to about 300 million on Instagram. Combined with the company’s machine-learning techniques, EyeEm’s search algorithm adapts over time to better understand what is part of each uploaded image, making it easier to find specific photos online, according to the company’s chief executive.\\n\\n\\nGentex transforms rear-view mirror into high-tech vision system:\\xa0Gentex Corp is broadening its role from a traditional Michigan-based auto parts maker to a supplier of high-tech vision systems that eventually could be integrated into self-driving cars. General Motors Co will be the first automaker to use a new rear-view mirror developed by Gentex, on the 2016 Cadillac CT6 sedan. The car goes on sale early next year and the mirror will be offered at extra cost. At the flip of a switch, the full display mirror converts into a video display that provides a panoramic view behind the vehicle. Called the Gentex Full Display Mirror, it incorporates a rear camera and software that transforms a prosaic piece of hardware into a platform for more advanced safety technology, marketing director Craig Piersma said. While relatively young tech-focused suppliers such as Mobileye NV have become investor favorites as the auto industry ramps up development of advanced driver assistance systems - the building blocks for future self-driving cars - Gentex has quietly been turning out 30 million rear-view mirrors a year. Founded in 1974, Gentex is one of the world\\'s largest suppliers of auto-dimming automotive mirrors, but it also has steadily beefed up its capability as an electronics manufacturer, expanding its expertise in cameras and displays. Among its products is the camera-based SmartBeam system that automatically switches headlamps from high to low beam. It also provides collision and lane departure warnings and vehicle and pedestrian detection.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

Now they will have the option to require full visibility before being charged at a higher per-view rate (which hasn\\'t yet been announced). The development is part of a two-tiered announcement today by the Menlo Park, Calif.-based tech giant, which also revealed that it has tapped digital-measurement company Moat to check how often advertisers\\' promos are seen on Facebook. While Moat is among several viewability-focused vendors that are accredited by the Media Ratings Council, inking this deal—which likely involves considerable sums of money in the near future—with Facebook appears to be the latest sign that Moat is leading its niche. \\xa0What\\'s more, Facebook is reversing its stance against using an independent verifier for ad viewability. The move appears to be largely in response to huge companies like Unilever, Kellogg\\'s and WPP banging the drum for better measurement tools in not only recent years but recent hours. Just yesterday, WPP chief Martin Sorrell called out Facebook\\'s viewability standards while speaking at Dmexco in Cologne, Germany.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAd Blockers Shoot to the Top of iPhone App Store Chart After Debut Day:\\xa0After the inaugural day of Apple’s latest operating system version, which permits new extensions for blocking content in Safari browsers, two apps that do just that shot to the top of the paid downloads. Peace, a $2.99 ad-blocking app created by former Tumblr engineer Marco Arment, currently sits at first place in the iOS paid apps, bumping Microsoft’s Minecraft. A similar app, Purify, built by developer Chris Aljoudi, is at fourth place. A third, Blockr, is the 28th most popular, as of Thursday morning.The apps, once activated, strip ads and tracking cookies out of the Safari browser on iPhones, but not other browsers, like Google’s Chrome, or within apps. Apple enabled them with iOS 9, which debuted on Wednesday. Publishers, particularly smaller ones, have worried that Apple’s move may spark an uptick in mobile ad blocking, curbing critical display ad revenue. It has been less of a concern for big ad-supported tech companies like Facebook and Twitter, since their bread and butter, in-stream ads within apps, won’t be affected by the blockers. Google, however, does make its cash from ads within the Web. The search giant has found a way to keep (read: paid for) its profitable text ads from being killed in previous popular content-blocking tools like AdBlock Plus. It’s not clear if Google has worked out a similar fix for these new iOS apps.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nShopify Surges After Partnership With Amazon:\\xa0Shopify Inc. soared after the Canadian software maker teamed up with online retailing giant Amazon.com Inc. to help merchants create their own online stores. The shares rose 23 percent to $35.55 at the close in New York on Thursday. The stock has about doubled since going public in May. Amazon advised the users of its own Amazon Webstore software to move their online stores to Shopify, before it shuts down the Webstore service. Shopify merchants will be able to use Amazon’s payments system and warehouses, and the companies are working to let Shopify merchants list their products on Amazon.com, according to a statement. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. For Shopify, the deal advances plans to let its more than 175,000 merchant customers sell goods on as many platforms as possible. The company already has similar arrangements with Pinterest, Facebook and Twitter.\\n\\n\\nAmazon Updates Its Fire TV and Tablet Offerings:\\xa0The company on Thursday introduced new versions of its Fire TV products, which plug into television sets to stream content over an Internet connection. Notably, customers can now buy a Fire TV streaming stick or set-top box with a remote control that can find content to watch using voice commands, similar to the new Siri-powered Apple TV unveiled last week. Amazon’s voice-controlled assistant is named Alexa. This assistant first appeared in Amazon’s wireless speaker, the Echo. You’ll be able to speak commands like “Alexa, play ‘John Wick’ ” to play a movie or “Alexa, how’s the weather tomorrow?” to load the weather forecast on the TV. But unlike Apple, which raised the starting price of its new Apple TV to $150 (up from $70 for the previous model), Amazon is holding its prices steady. You can get the latest stick for the same $40 as before; the Fire TV streaming stick with a voice remote is $50. The Fire TV set-top box with the new remote is the same price as the previous model: $100. And in another sign of how serious Amazon is about competing for attention in the living room, the retail giant is also bundling the Fire TV set-top box with a game controller for $140. In addition, Amazon has added some cheap tablets to its Fire product family. It is offering a low-end Fire tablet for $50, which can also be bought as a six-pack for $250. This inexpensive tablet has a seven-inch screen, can play movies and load books, apps and games. On top of that, Amazon introduced two new tablets with high-definition screens, called Fire HD, which come in eight inches for $150 and in 10.1 inches for $230. (By comparison, Apple’s latest tablets cost $380 to $800.)\\n\\n\\nAs Search Matures, Baidu Tries to Move Offline:\\xa0Baidu is spending an estimated $2.5 billion on e-commerce projects this year as its profits dwindle.\\xa0Baidu runs China’s primary search engine, but with the PC search business maturing and the economy slowing, Chairman Robin Li has been looking to diversify. In the past two years, he’s pushed Baidu deeper into the kinds of e-commerce businesses dominated by China’s other two big Internet companies, Alibaba and Tencent. During that time, Baidu’s invested almost $1 billion in more than a dozen websites and apps specializing in everything from food delivery to laundry pickup, from booking a doctor’s appointment to reserving a slot at a karaoke club. The goal is “transforming the company from connecting people with information to connecting people with services,” says Li, who’s committing $3.1 billion more over the next three years to just one of Baidu’s investments, Groupon look-alike Nuomi.com. But as it commits more money to e-commerce expansion efforts, its profit margins have fallen by half since 2012, to 28 percent in its most recent quarter. So while Baidu is tapping its $12 billion in cash to widen its e-commerce footprint, it’s also trying to attract big-name partners. The company paid an undisclosed amount for a minority stake in Uber in December, and fast-food chain Ajisen announced in July that it’s investing $60 million in Baidu’s takeout service, which launched last year and has about 8 percent of China’s market. Borrowing from Amazon.com’s strategy, Li is also expanding Baidu’s entertainment offerings. Its video service, IQiyi, signed a deal with Paramount Pictures in July for local streaming rights to 800 of the studio’s titles, including the Transformers and Terminator series. Baidu has a ways to go before its new ventures pay for themselves. Investment bank Jefferies estimates that Baidu’s profit will fall more than 12 percent this year, to about $1.8 billion, while the company spends $2.5 billion on its e-commerce-centric expansion. Baidu’s Nasdaq-listed shares have dropped 28 percent in the past six months, and Li says he may consider delisting from the U.S. in favor of his home market. But, he says, “We need to be patient and give our U.S. investors some time. I hope they will be able to appreciate us more.”\\n\\n\\nStartups are piggybacking on text messaging to launch services.\\xa0Conventional wisdom holds that intricately designed mobile apps are an essential part of most new consumer technology services. But there are signs people are getting apped out. While the amount of time U.S. smartphone users spend with apps continues to increase, the number of apps the average person uses has stayed pretty much flat for the last two years, according to a report Nielsen published in June. Some 200 apps account for more than 70 percent of total usage. Product Hunt, a popular website where people post ideas for new tech services, recently compiled a list of more than 40 “apps without an interface,” most of which use text messaging to do things like schedule meetings, sell T-shirts, or process restaurant delivery orders. In August, Facebook introduced M, a digital personal assistant built into its messaging service that allows people to text requests for a dinner reservation or for the perfect baby gift. The service, which is being tested by a small number of users in California, hints at Facebook’s ambitions to transform its own messaging app into a kind of proprietary Internet where people spend all their time instead of bouncing around among different apps. The social media giant appears to be emulating China’s WeChat, which has embedded a broad range of services into its mobile messaging product. The simplicity of text-based services often obscures deep complexity. Most companies still struggle with what’s known as natural language processing, so what may appear to be impressive feats of automation are actually being done by old-fashioned humans. Facebook’s M service uses artificial intelligence to field requests, but people perform the actual tasks. Magic, a text-based concierge service that inspired excitement in startup circles when it was introduced earlier this year, does the same.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba\\'s Wipeout Leaves Investors Questioning What Comes Next:\\xa0Alibaba looked like a sure thing a year ago when it pulled off the largest initial public offering ever. It had a lock on China e-commerce as the economy was surging and consumer spending was steadily rising. Shares soared 76 percent from the IPO price in just two months. Then it all crumbled. Alibaba came under fire from a China government agency, it cut deals that baffled investors and it replaced its chief executive as growth slowed. Most important, China’s economy turned wobbly, jeopardizing the rise in consumer spending Alibaba needed. Its stock slid down, down, down to the IPO price and then below. The sure thing was no such thing. What now? Investors who watched $128 billion in market value disappear shouldn’t expect a reprieve any time soon. Atlantic Equities’s James Cordwell, the top-ranked analyst covering the stock, predicts the slowing Chinese economy will undercut e-commerce transaction growth until at least 2016. The many deals Alibaba has negotiated will take time to pay off too. “All the operating metrics seem to be pointing in the wrong direction,” said London-based Cordwell, who topped Bloomberg Absolute Return rankings for his calls on Alibaba and also recommendations across the portfolio he covers. “Until investors feel some comfort in that slowdown bottoming out, it will be hard for the stock.”\\n\\n\\nAdobe revenue, profit forecast miss estimates, shares slip.\\xa0Adobe Systems Inc\\'s lower-than-expected revenue and profit forecast for the current quarter overshadowed a strong rise in net subscriptions for its Creative Cloud software suite, sending its shares down 3.5 percent in extended trading. Revenue rose 21 percent to $1.22 billion. Net income rose to $174.5 million, or 34 cents per share, in the third quarter, from $44.7 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier. Up to Thursday\\'s close of $80.31, Adobe\\'s shares had risen about 11 percent this year. The company also said on Thursday that David Wadhwani, head of its digital media, was leaving to pursue a CEO opportunity. Adobe has been switching to web-based subscriptions from traditional licensed software to help attract more predictable recurring revenue. Recurring revenue had reached 73 percent of total revenue, Chief Financial Officer Mark Garrett said in a statement. The company said it added 684,000 Creative Cloud net subscriptions in the quarter ended Aug. 28, compared with the 640,000 net additions that analysts had expected, according to research firm FactSet Street Account.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOracle earnings disappoint: Revenue falls 1.7%, Stock down 2.8%:\\xa0Oracle Corp\\'s sales fell more than expected in the first quarter, hurt by a strong dollar and a continued drop in licensed software sales and the company warned revenue could fall in the current quarter even on a constant currency basis. Oracle\\'s revenue declined 1.7 percent to $8.45 billion in the quarter ended Aug. 31, missing analysts estimates for the third quarter in a row. The company said sales increased 7 percent on a constant currency basis. However, it forecast revenue to range between a fall of 2 percent to growth of 1 percent in the current quarter. Oracle\\'s shares fell as much as 2.8 percent in extended trading on Wednesday. Sales of Oracle\\'s cloud-computing software and platform service rose 34 percent to $451 million. Sales of traditional software licenses fell 16 percent to $1.51 billion. Like its rivals such as SAP, IBM and Microsoft, Oracle is striving to boost Internet-based software sales to head off fast-growing competitors such as Salesforce.com. But, analysts have said Oracle\\'s cloud software business has not been growing fast enough to make up for declines in the 38-year-old company\\'s licensed software business due to reasons ranging from slow customer adoption to tough competition.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLyft Announces Deal With Didi Kuaidi, the Chinese Ride-Hailing Company:\\xa0The pink mustache is coming to China. And it will receive a warm welcome — not a snub — from its new hosts. Lyft, the San Francisco-based ride-hailing start-up that has its drivers affix a striking pink mustache logo to their cars, announced a partnership with Didi Kuaidi, China’s pre-eminent ride-hailing company, that will allow the American company to operate in China for the first time. The cross-border deal will also let Didi Kuaidi operate in the United States. Lyft’s partnership with Didi Kuaidi offers a somewhat novel approach to international expansion. Didi Kuaidi, which comprises China’s two largest ride-hailing start-ups, will let Lyft users from the United States find rides in China using the Lyft app. Didi Kuaidi will fulfill those ride requests using its drivers, while Lyft users will not have to leave the app to download or sign up for any new services. Didi Kuaidi will have much the same agreement with Lyft for its users. Chinese users entering the United States can find a ride using the Didi Kuaidi app, with those rides being fulfilled by Lyft. The partnership between the two companies is perhaps the clearest sign yet of the race to conquer different parts of the world in the global ride-hailing industry. The handful of major companies in the business of providing car rides have raised giant sums of money — some into the billions of dollars — and are using the money to open in new markets and release new product offerings. Nearly all of these companies have their eye on Uber, the huge on-demand ride company that has raised more than $7 billion in venture capital and is valued at more than $50 billion. Over the last five years, Uber has exploded in growth to more than 300 cities across 60 countries. China, in particular, has recently been a hotbed of contention and competition for ride-hailing start-ups. Uber has earmarked more than $1 billion for its aggressive push into Asia — and particularly China — and is spending millions in subsidies to attract drivers and riders to its service with lucrative promotions. Still, Uber’s presence in China is dwarfed by that of Didi Kuaidi, which controls 80 percent of the overall ride-hailing market in China.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Acquires Mapsense, a Mapping Visualization Startup:\\xa0Apple’s steady stealth campaign to rival Google in maps continues apace. This month, the company acquired Mapsense, a San Francisco startup that builds tools for analyzing and visualizing location data, according to multiple sources. Apple paid somewhere between $25 million and $30 million for the Mapsense 12-person team, which will now join the Cupertino company, according to two sources. “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,” the company said in a statement. Mapsense was formed in 2013 by Erez Cohen, a former engineer for the data science company Palantir Technologies. The company’s offering lets users slice and dice graphical models of maps that hold huge sums of data. It’s cloud-based, naturally. The company launched its developer platform in May, noting that it was welcoming customers from the financial sector, advertising, government and Fortune 500 firms. That same month, Mapsense raised $2.5 million in a seed round led by General Catalyst with other backers including Amplify.LA and Redpoint Ventures. Over the years, Apple has quietly scooped up several location-services companies, including HopStop, a crowd-sourced maps tool, in 2013 and Coherent Navigation, a GPS company, this past May.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlaBlaCar, a French Ride-Sharing Start-Up, Is Valued at $1.6 Billion:\\xa0BlaBlaCar, the French ride-hailing start-up, announced on Wednesday that it had raised $200 million, primarily from United States investors, which valued the company at $1.6 billion. The funding comes as the Paris-based company, which was founded in 2006 and aims to connect people who want to split the cost of long-distance journeys, has expanded beyond its European roots into a growing number of emerging markets like Turkey, India and Russia. With roughly 20 million users spread across three continents, BlaBlaCar is hoping to follow in the footsteps of other on-demand services like Uber, the ride-booking company, and Airbnb, the vacation rental website, to expand its international operations. BlaBlaCar has so far mostly skirted controversy, unlike companies like Uber, which has faced protests from many regulators and taxi associations. That is because BlaBlaCar does not allow drivers to profit from the ride-sharing service. People can only split the cost of long-distance travel, say between Paris and Marseilles or Moscow and St. Petersburg. The French start-up says the average ride in Europe costs roughly $25 per person, significantly less than the region’s costly high-speed trains. The funding comes as the Paris-based company, which was founded in 2006 and aims to connect people who want to split the cost of long-distance journeys, has expanded beyond its European roots into a growing number of emerging markets like Turkey, India and Russia.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to Donate to a Political Candidate? Now There\\'s a Tweet for That\\xa0Twitter said it had partnered with Square Inc., a mobile payment company, to give U.S. political candidates a way to collect donations through tweets. Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter and Square, is running both companies after taking an interim CEO job at Twitter, making their cooperation on the donations tool convenient. \"This is the fastest, easiest way to make an online donation, and the most effective way for campaigns to execute tailored digital fundraising, in real time, on the platform where Americans are already talking about the 2016 election and the issues they are passionate about,\" Jenna Golden, head of Twitter\\'s political advertising sales, said in a post on the company\\'s website. The new service comes after a U.S. Federal Election Commission ruling in 2012 that cleared the way for donations by text message and as candidates seek ways to increase the number of small donations from supporters. \\xa0Twitter\\'s service allows a user to select a donation amount, pay with a debit card and submit information required by the FEC. Square charges a 1.9 percent transaction fee, according to its website. Twitter doesn\\'t take a cut of the donation, according to the social media company. Campaigns can pay to promote tweets soliciting donations to specific users.\\n\\n\\nFacebook weighs a \"Dislike\" button:\\xa0Facebook’s famous “like” button, with its silhouette of an upturned thumb, will soon be accompanied by an alternative: a way to “dislike” a post. On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s co-founder and chief executive, said that Facebook was “very close to shipping a test” of a dislike button. He suggested that the new button would probably be more nuanced than a simple thumbs-down option. His comments nevertheless raised the possibility that Facebook, the world’s largest forum for self-expression, could soon become a less friendly place. The prospect of a new dislike button has been polarizing among Facebook users. As for Facebook’s business — selling ads — a dislike button could cut both ways. It could increase the level of engagement that people have with posts, and therefore the number of ads they eventually see. But a dislike button could also be disconcerting to marketers, who prefer their messages to be surrounded by happy emotions. Over all, it’s probably a good thing to enable people to express feelings and emotions that they can’t express through a like button,” Ms. Williamson said. “But Facebook needs to be careful as to how they enable that capability with regard to advertising and all the potentially inflammatory discussions that could occur online.” Mr. Zuckerberg clearly has such concerns in mind. He stressed that Facebook would test the new button before introducing it broadly, and refine it based on user feedback. “Hopefully we’ll deliver something that meets the needs of our community,” he said. Facebook’s decision to experiment with a new button came after much deliberation. In December, Mr. Zuckerberg told a similar meeting of users that the company had been working on the idea but had not figured out how to add a dislike button “so that it ends up being a force for good and not a force for bad.”\\n\\n\\nHewlett-Packard to Cut About 30,000 Jobs, About 10 Percent of Work Force:\\xa0About 10 percent of the jobs at the current HP, or perhaps 30,000 of its 300,000 employees, will be eliminated, company officials said. “We’re looking forward to operating as two industry-leading companies,” said Ms. Whitman, HP’s chief executive, speaking at a meeting of financial analysts. “You’ll see us doing more pruning of businesses that don’t fit.” Ms. Whitman became the head of HP in 2011. As part of a restructuring announced in 2012, 54,000 jobs have been cut at the company. The new cuts are on top of that. In November, Ms. Whitman will become the chief executive of HP Enterprise, or HPE, which will sell things like computer servers, data storage, software and services to business. The other company, called HP Inc., will focus on printers and personal computers. Ms. Whitman has said the division will enable both businesses to react faster to changing markets. The big job cuts will come from HP Enterprise, in particular jobs at call centers and other service centers in developed countries. HP plans to automate many of the jobs, and build out positions in countries like India and Costa Rica. The services business had been largely dependent on just a few customers, and in 2014 it lost important accounts.\\n\\n\\n\\nSalesforce Plans to Give Customers Amazon-Type Analytics:\\xa0Salesforce.com was one of the early giants of the cloud-computing revolution. Now it wants to be at the center of two of the next big things — big data and so-called computational intelligence everywhere. Marc Benioff, the co-founder and chief executive of Salesforce, is expected to make its “Internet of Things Cloud” a centerpiece of the company’s customer conference in San Francisco this week. Mr. Benioff, who has been skilled at predicting and positioning his company on major tech trends, sometimes with mixed success, hopes he can give nontechnical companies automated customer service and recommendations, the kind of activities done by computing-intensive companies like Amazon. If successful, Salesforce’s Internet of Things could vastly increase the amount of personalization we now see in many products and services. It could also justify the company’s highflying stock price, by making it much more attractive to its own customers. The Internet of Things is a term for online data from machines about their behavior. This service would combine data from devices like sensors and smartphones with customer information already inside Salesforce, like personal profiles and previous transactions. In one example from Salesforce, an insurance company would get data from a car’s bumpers and airbag indicating a collision, and could then send to its customer’s phone messages about current coverage, nearby tow trucks and service centers. Salesforce hopes to bring that capability to thousands of companies, which work with millions of customers. Nothing like that has been done before, let alone in a way that people skilled only in basic spreadsheets could manage. That means Salesforce has to build a powerful sorting and computing technology, and a series of customizable templates that can be easily used in a lot of different businesses. No major company has successfully done that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSnapchat is going to charge for extra replays.\\xa0Snapchat announced a new plan for making money Tuesday — it\\'s going to let you pay for extra replays. According to the company\\'s blog, the ephemeral messaging service wants to let you get a tiny bit more permanent. Users already get one free replay per day, but now Snapchat will let users pay 99 cents for up to three additional chances to see a snap again. \"We’ve provided one Replay per Snapchatter per day, sometimes frustrating the millions of Snapchatters who receive many daily Snaps deserving of a Replay,\" the company said in an official blog post. \"But then we realized — a Replay is like a compliment! So why stop at just one?\" According to Snapchat, the replays work like this: you can use a replay on any snap you receive but, crucially, can only replay any single snap once. To this point, Snapchat has made its money off advertising, and has not previously charged users for any part of its service. The company, which reportedly turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook, has been valued at roughly $19 billion on private markets. But a recent report from Gawker, citing leaked financial documents, indicated that Snapchat had generated just $3.1 million in revenue last year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTarget Teams With Instacart to Challenge Amazon on Groceries:\\xa0Target is teaming up with Instacart Inc. to offer same-day delivery of groceries and household items for $3.99 in its hometown of Minneapolis as the big-box retailer rolls out an alternative to Amazon.com’s $299-a-year Amazon Fresh grocery delivery service. Target will be Instacart’s second-largest retail partner by revenue, behind Costco, significantly expanding inventory for the San Francisco-based startup as it positions itself as the antidote to Amazon for brick-and-mortar retailers. Instacart delivery charges start at $3.99 per order, depending on its size. Even as sales of books, electronics and clothing shift online, shoppers still prefer supermarkets for food. Companies expect that grocery sales may move to the Web as well and are experimenting to find the best approach. Amazon, the world’s largest e-commerce retailer, has promoted its grocery delivery service with free 30-day trials in some markets. Google last week announced plans to begin testing a delivery service for groceries and fresh food later this year in San Francisco and one other city.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook Works With Google To Let Mobile Web Users Get Push Notifications Via Chrome:\\xa0A big reason developers hate mobile websites is that they lack the push notifications which help re-engage people with native apps. That was a serious problem for Facebook. It sees a ton of users on its\\xa0m.facebook.com\\xa0site, especially in the developing world where data budgets are tight, but had trouble pulling them back in. So today Facebook announced that after working with Google on its new mobile web alerts standard,\\xa0m.facebook.com\\xa0mobile web users can now opt to receive push notifications via Chrome. Google first announced the development of its third-party push API through Chrome back in April and noted some partners like eBay and Vice News who had committed to implementing the standard. Now Facebook has rolled out the feature, \\xa0so mobile Chrome users on\\xa0m.facebook.com\\xa0will be asked to turn on Chrome pushes. Facebook’s product manager on browser partnerships Jonathan McKay tells me that already, “We’ve seen an increase in visitation from launching push notifications.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndian cab-hailing firm Ola is raising $500 million+, at a valuation that we’ve heard is around the $5 billion mark, with $225 million committed so far. The news comes as the company — which competes in its home market against the likes of Uber and Indian startup Meru — continues to expand into more cities, and more products. Today, Ola launched a new car leasing service for drivers on its network; last week it expanded to shuttle services for commuters. The raise is due to be finalised in the next week or two and announced officially then, sources tell TechCrunch. As it is still in progress, the final amount and final valuation may also change. This funding, a Series F, has been rumored for some time now, with the first reports surfacing just after Ola announced its last raise of $400 million in April of this year. That round, a Series E, valued the company at $2.5 billion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRussian Authorities Rule Google Broke Antitrust Regulations:\\xa0\\xa0Russian antitrust authorities ruled on Monday that Google broke the country’s competition rules, adding to the regulatory headaches the search giant is facing worldwide. Russian officials said that Google had abused its dominant market position with Android, its mobile operating system, by favoring the company’s own services over those of rivals, including Yandex, a Russian competitor. Earlier this year, Yandex had complained to the country’s competition authority that cellphone manufacturers were not able to include the company’s rival digital offerings in the Android operating system. After the complaint, the regulator began investigating whether Google unfairly bundled its own services, like digital maps, in its Android software. Unlike in other parts of the world, where Google has outmuscled domestic search rivals, Yandex still holds more than a 50 percent market share in Russian online search, according to industry statistics. The company’s share price rose more than 8 percent in early afternoon trading in New York after the regulatory decision was announced. “Russia is the first jurisdiction to have officially recognized these practices as anticompetitive,” Yandex said in a statement, in reference to Google’s favoring of its own services in Android over those of rivals. The company added that it believed the antitrust ruling would “serve to restore competition in the market.” European and other international antitrust watchdogs are taking an increasingly tough line against the company.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe auto and tech worlds are fighting for the best minds in race for self-driving car:\\xa0Google had all of Silicon Valley to choose from when deciding on a leader for its ambitious self-driving car division. Instead, the tech behemoth hired an auto-industry lifer: John Krafcik, a former head of Hyundai\\'s American brand who got his start as an engineer working on the Ford Explorer. The announcement on Monday comes just a week after Toyota said it, too, had looked outside its industry for its next big name. Earlier this month, the carmaker said it had tapped the military’s chief robotics engineer, Gill Pratt, to lead a $50 million push into not just driverless cars but artificial intelligence, through investments into tech research labs. The high-profile hires spotlight the growing overlap between the global giants of autos and tech, and analysts say it could point to a growing tension between some of the industries\\' biggest, wealthiest names. Tech giants increasingly see ways to make money and save lives in the old-fashioned, hyper-profitable business of cars.

Twitter Inc. said it’s adopting Stripe’s offering, called Relay, to make it easier to buy products from a link in a tweet. InMobi, a mobile-advertising company, and SAP SE’s e-commerce software unit Hybris also said they are integrating their services with the San Francisco-based startup’s product.\\xa0Payments processing company Stripe Inc launched a new tool on Monday that will connect retailers and brands to sell on platforms like Twitter Inc and tap an increasing number of consumers shopping on mobile apps. Twitter\\'s adoption of Stripe\\'s new product, Relay, is expected to help the microblogging site further dabble in e-commerce and generate revenue through its \"buy buttons,\" which lets shoppers buy a product and enter payment and shipping information without leaving Twitter\\'s platform. Twitter has been struggling to increase its audience and in July said its number of monthly average users grew at its slowest pace since it went public in 2013. Stripe, which makes software that helps businesses accept various types of payments on websites and in apps, counts grocery-delivery startup Instacart, ride-sharing app Lyft and e-commerce platform Shopify among its clients. The payments company\\'s new Relay product functions as a universal sell button for retailers, allowing companies like eyewear brand Warby Parker to list products in a single place and sell them directly on Twitter as well as other e-commerce platforms like ShopStyle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba Falls After Barron\\'s Suggests Drop, Company Rebuts\\xa0Alibaba shares fell Monday, the first day of trading since a Barron’s magazine article on Saturday suggested the Chinese Internet company may lose another 50 percent of its value. The company, in a statement posted Monday on its website, said the article was inaccurate and misleading. Barron’s based its conclusion that the Chinese company is overvalued, in part, by comparing Alibaba’s share price as a multiple of earnings estimates with EBay. Alibaba said the comparison is unfair because EBay’s online marketplace doesn’t do significant business in China.

Now, with public markets on a see-saw and venture capitalists thinking the turmoil may hit private markets, many investors are wondering if more Homejoys lie ahead. That is leading them to look extra hard at companies that hold similar characteristics to Homejoy: on-demand, logistics-heavy businesses that cater to consumers rather than businesses. \"They are caught on a treadmill\" because to keep running requires more cash infusions, though often without an accompanying move to profitability, said Venky Ganesan, a venture capitalist at Menlo Ventures. He said he looked at about a half dozen such companies in the spring and early summer, passing on all of them, only to see all raise money elsewhere. While the failure of one start-up might not seem like much, Homejoy\\'s folding attracted outsized interest because it had already raised more than $35 million from high-caliber firms. Most start-ups fail, of course, but they generally do it at earlier stages and lower cost to their backers. Homejoy is one of at least four high-profile collapses or retrenchments so far in 2015, counting those that raised at least as much cash, also from top firms.

In the process, the two companies are establishing a novel business model with implications for other American technology firms looking to do business in China’s politically sensitive tech industry. The partnership, signed in July 2014, is between CloudFlare, a security company based in San Francisco, and Baidu, China’s equivalent of Google. Using a mixture of CloudFlare’s web traffic technology and Baidu’s network of data centers in China, the two created a service that enables websites to load more quickly across China’s border. The service, called Yunjiasu, began operating in December. It has a unified network that makes foreign sites more easily accessible in China, and allows Chinese sites to run in destinations outside the country. At the heart of the arrangement is an unusual structure known as a virtual joint venture. Under that arrangement, CloudFlare does not actually operate in China. Instead, CloudFlare cooperates primarily from afar as Baidu runs the business in China. Baidu and CloudFlare’s virtual joint venture relies on a principle generally considered anathema to foreign companies looking to do business with China: trust. CloudFlare transferred its intellectual property that is used to manage and speed up Internet traffic to Baidu and works closely with its engineers to run that technology on Baidu’s network in China. The two share revenue from the service. For CloudFlare, a five-year-old company that manages Internet traffic for millions of websites and makes browsing quicker and more secure, the central question was whether to transfer its intellectual property and give up local control or to forgo the vast business opportunities in China. Outside of the high-profile sites that Beijing sees as a threat and blocks — like Facebook and Twitter — are a huge number of businesses that suffer under China’s network inefficiencies. Those are the customers the service is targeting. And since the fast-lane service began operating, CloudFlare and Baidu said they have registered 450,000 businesses that account for 57 billion page views per month. Customers can try the service free, though CloudFlare and Baidu added supplemental security features and greater control over web traffic last month, both of which must be paid for. Matthew Prince, CloudFlare’s chief executive, said transferring the company’s intellectual property to Baidu enabled a deeper trust and a partnership. He added that the intellectual property is not the most critical part of the company. “We had much less apprehension about sharing our code, because we don’t think there’s any line of code we write that’s so clever that gives us a sustained advantage,” Mr. Prince said. “That comes from the network itself.” \\xa0Still, to be safe, Baidu and CloudFlare worked out a contract that gives each company control over crucial elements and would inflict penalties if either partner withdrew. For example, Baidu controls customer information within China, but CloudFlare owns the web address through which the entire operation works.\\n\\n\\nEBay Revamps Seller-Rating System in Appeal to Merchants:\\xa0EBay is overhauling its ratings system so that sellers aren’t penalized for late shipments beyond their control or for routine returns and exchanges, seeking to boost sales as an independent company. While the online marketplace has long relied on a five-star rating system and commentaries that lets merchants and buyers grade each other on transactions, sellers have long complained that these also make them vulnerable to customer angst over minor issues that are unavoidable or easily resolved. EBay’s seller rankings can make or break the merchants selling everything from sweaters to smartphones, because they influence how prominently products appear in search results and the likelihood that shoppers will conduct business with them. EBay is stepping up efforts to keep its sellers happy, following its split in July from the PayPal Holdings Inc. transactions business. \"Our relationship with our sellers needs to be improved,\" Jordan Sweetnam, EBay’s vice president of seller experience, said in an interview. \"These are the biggest changes we’ve made in years.\" The new rating system is more simple and objective, according to Sweetnam. Sellers won’t be penalized for late deliveries as long as they get orders to couriers on time, while returns or exchanges won’t affect ratings if they’re resolved and the customer is satisfied with the process.\\n\\n\\nLyft automatically opts you into receiving robocalls. That doesn’t sit well with the FCC.\\xa0Lyft and First National Bank are on notice for violating federal telemarketing rules, regulators said Friday. The two companies allegedly required that their customers accept robocalls and automatic text messages as a condition of using their services — a no-no under the Federal Communications Commission\\'s regulations. The rules are meant to prevent companies from coercing customers into consenting to robocalls. Although Lyft allows users to opt out of robocalls, doing so bars consumers from using the ridesharing service, the FCC said. If the two companies don\\'t change their behavior, that could lead to more than a warning — fines or other legal action.\\n\\n\\nTrillenium takes virtual reality into online shopping:\\xa0Trillenium, a start-up that creates virtual stores for brands aimed at marrying the experience of real-life shopping with the convenience of e-commerce on smartphones and computers. Shoppers can tour the virtual store by focusing their gaze on products, browse items from different angles and socialize with friends online, bringing to life an e-commerce industry currently dominated by search boxes and static pictures. \"The current\\xa0dot.com experience is pretty sterile. So if they can improve the experience, you might dwell a bit longer, spend a bit longer online exploring products because you can get closer to them, and buy more,\" said Dave Evans, commercial director at Kantar Retail Virtual Reality, which uses virtual reality technology to help retailers develop real-world stores. Trillenium hopes to capitalize on the release of virtual reality headsets next year aimed at the consumer market, such as Facebook\\'s Occulus Rift and Google\\'s Cardboard. Trillenium has raised 335,000 pounds so far from Seedrs as well as two business angel investors. It hopes to raise an additional 1.8 million pounds in separate funds from venture capitalists. In three years, Prpic hopes to launch a multiple platform service where clients can use his technology to build and customize their own stores from a template.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJet.com: Taking Off, Full Throttle. Respected seller blog ChannelAdvisor reports\\xa0- \"Jet has gained altitude so rapidly that it’s currently our number 4 marketplace by GMV, out of the marketplaces we support worldwide. That means that just a month after its public debut, it’s already bigger for ChannelAdvisor than incumbents like Sears, Best Buy, Newegg, Tesco and Rakuten — marketplaces that have been operating for years (check out the growth of these marketplaces here). It’s not out of the realm of possibility that in 2016 it will be our number 3 marketplace, after Amazon and eBay. That would be remarkable. Just a few weeks after officially launching, the average Jet seller GMV is twice that of seller GMV on Sears or Newegg. Our sellers have seen tens of thousands unique consumers buying on Jet since its public launch, and a 23% repeat buyer rate. Over the same time period, eBay had a 17% repeat buyer rate and Amazon had a 11% repeat buyer rate. This indicates early shoppers on Jet find the values compelling enough to come back more frequently than on eBay and Amazon, although our sample size is still small.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle Starts Rolling Out Android Pay to Challenge Apple:\\xa0Google is starting to roll out Android Pay this week, seeking to catch up with Apple Pay and grab a chunk of the growing market for mobile payments. The Web company, which announced plans for the service in May, has signed up partners including Macy’s, Staples and Whole Foods Market, Pali Bhat, Google’s director of product management for the new feature, said in a blog post Thursday. Android Pay turns smartphones into digital wallets that store credit and debit cards, which can then be used in physical and virtual stores. The mobile-payments market is projected to top $142 billion by 2019, up from $67 billion this year, according to Forrester Research Inc. Android Pay users will be able to shop for goods in more than 1 million U.S. locations and in over 1,000 apps, according to Google, which competes with Apple Inc., PayPal Holdings Inc. and other rivals that have introduced digital wallets. Google is betting Android Pay will help its smartphones lure more consumers. Like Apple Pay is built into iPhones, Android Pay will be integrated into smartphones running Google’s mobile operating system. Google’s earlier effort, Google Wallet, has been reoriented to focus on sending and receiving money, the company said today. Android Pay is also is working on new features, including the ability to use loyalty cards and special offers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber’s China Foe Said to Join Alibaba, Tencent in Lyft Deal:\\xa0Uber’s Chinese rival invested in U.S. ride-sharing service Lyft around the second quarter, according to people familiar with an investment that takes the battle with Uber abroad. Didi Kuaidi joined Alibaba and Tencent in the funding round between March and June, the people said, asking not to be named because the deal was private. Their joint investment was intended to fuel Didi Kuaidi’s expansion abroad and bankroll Uber’s U.S. competitor, the people said. Alibaba invested $25 million, one of the people said. Asia’s two largest Internet companies already back Didi Kuaidi, the leading Chinese car-hailing service formed in February from two competing apps. Uber and Didi Kuaidi are locked in a costly struggle in China, competing for market share with incentives and subsidies to lure drivers and passengers. Both are close to raising more than $4 billion combined from investors in their latest fundraising rounds, people familiar with the plans said previously. Alibaba had been part of a consortium that backed San Francisco-based Lyft, whose cars in the U.S. sport distinctive pink mustaches on their front. The service counts Carl Icahn among its investors and was valued in a March fundraising round at $2.5 billion. Uber, in contrast, was said to be valued at more than $40 billion in its last round.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Sells Bonds in Euros Extending Debt Binge to $55 Billion:\\xa0Apple sold bonds in euros for the second time, increasing the amount the iPhone maker has raised in global debt offerings since 2013 to more than $55 billion. The 2 billion-euro ($2.3 billion) sale was split evenly between bonds maturing in eight years and 12 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Apple sold the longer-dated notes at 85 basis points more than benchmark rates. That compares with the 45 basis-point premium for securities maturing in 2026 that the company sold in its debut euro offering in November, the data show. Apple has sold bonds around the world to diversify funding as it works to return $200 billion to investors by March 2017 and expands its global retail network. While the cost of funding has increased since Apple’s debut euro sale, U.S. companies can still raise capital in the single currency at a 2.07 percentage-point average discount to borrowing in dollars, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. \\xa0“It’s slightly more expensive than last year’s euro-bond sale, but you’re still paying less than 2 percent for 12 years,” said Geraud Charpin, a portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management in London. “It’s pretty cheap money. What else do you want to ask for?” Apple will use the proceeds from the bond sale for general corporate purposes, as well as to buy back shares, pay dividends, boost working capital and to fund capital expenditure, acquisitions and repayment of debt, according to the person.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChina says Apple unit underpaid $71 million in tax in 2013:\\xa0A China unit of U.S. tech giant Apple underpaid taxes in 2013 by 452 million yuan ($71 million), according to a report from the country\\'s finance ministry, which comes as China toughens its stance on tax payments by foreign firms. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) report, dated Sept. 9 but cited by official news agency Xinhua on Thursday, said Apple had already repaid the taxes as well as paying 65 million yuan in late fees. The investigation, however, underlines an increasingly hard stance being taken by Beijing against foreign firms underpaying taxes after authorities said in December they would crack down on the practice. The finance ministry report said the Apple subsidiary had understated its revenues by 8.8 billion yuan and its costs by 3.4 billion yuan. It had also overstated its profits by 5.4 billion yuan. China levied around $140 million in back taxes from Microsoft Corp at the end of last year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUbers Are About To Start Carrying Their Own In-Car Magazine:\\xa0Starting this week in NYC, you can grab a copy of Uber’s new in-car magazine, called “Arriving Now,” from the seat-back pockets. A new print publication isn’t exactly a revolutionary move (airlines have been rocking inflight magazines for a while), but Uber has an interesting opportunity here to test the content waters. At face value, it seems like kind of a funny move for them to get into the truly burgeoning print journalism market, but there are a ton of different directions that this could be taken. Uber is probably more interested here in testing out a content arm where they can push out cool stories that gives people a better “brand experience” with the company. Though most people probably spend their time on a phone in the back of an Uber regardless, seat-back, always-on touch screens could probably be coming soon enough to a car near you, allowing users more ways to interact with Uber’s continually growing on-demand services that don’t necessarily involve getting people from place-to-place.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Bloomberg Terminal, a Wall Street Fixture, Faces Upstarts:\\xa0\\xa0For nearly three decades, the flickering orange-on-black screens of the Bloomberg terminal have been omnipresent on Wall Street trading floors and executive suite desks, maintaining a vital lifeline of data and communication. In knitting together the world of finance, those $21,000-a-year terminals have generated billions of dollars for Bloomberg, almost single-handedly paying for the company’s journalistic ambitions, as well as the fortune, political career and philanthropic largess of its founder, Michael R. Bloomberg. Now that golden egg — and all that it pays for — is a target for new competitors looking to knock it from its dominant position. Bloomberg has fended off competition before, but the latest upstarts are gunning for the company at a time when Wall Street is already aggressively looking to cut its spending on Bloomberg terminals. Later this month, a start-up called Symphony, created by Goldman Sachs and backed by the large banks, is introducing software that provides an alternative to what many traders say is the most valuable part of the Bloomberg terminal — the chat program used by traders and investors. At Goldman, more than half of the people who have Bloomberg terminals use them primarily for chat and other simple functions, according to people briefed on the subject who were not authorized to speak publicly. At the same time, Money.Net, a start-up that has been built by a former top Bloomberg executive, is looking to challenge Bloomberg head-on and is gaining momentum and stealing away customers. After more than a decade as New York’s mayor, Mr. Bloomberg has been retaking the reins of the company and pushing to refine its focus. Last week, dozens of Bloomberg journalists were laid off as part of a broader effort to reconfigure how journalism fits into the company. Bloomberg’s news offerings — including BusinessWeek and the company’s website — generate less than 4 percent of the company’s revenue and cost more than they earn, according to Burton-Taylor Consulting. The terminals generate 75 percent of Bloomberg’s revenue. All service providers for Wall Street, not just Bloomberg, are unusually vulnerable at the moment. The financial industry is in the middle of an aggressive run of cost-cutting as it grapples with new regulations and changes in the markets. A Bloomberg contract, which can be upward of $100 million at larger institutions, is a tempting target to whittle down. The number of Bloomberg terminals grew only 1.9 percent, to 325,000, last year. In the 10 years before the financial crisis, the number of terminals grew at an average rate of 12 percent each year, with most companies signing on for multiyear contracts. Bloomberg has sustained several challenges to its dominant market position, fending off smaller competitors hoping to bite off a corner of its business. And it has the cash reservoirs to wage a vigorous defense this time around. But Bloomberg’s own history shows that it is not easy to maintain a profitable market position like the one it has held for more than two decades. Bloomberg rose to prominence in the 1990s by nimbly replacing earlier Wall Street data companies — like Quotron and Telerate — that failed to change quickly enough to protect their longtime market dominance. Morgan Downey, the former Bloomberg executive who is building Money.Net, said he decided to leave Bloomberg in late 2013 and create a low-cost challenger after seeing how slowly Bloomberg was changing and how many of the company’s clients wanted a cheaper alternative. “When they go visit the banks, they are being told, ‘We are trying actively, not passively, to get away from being your customers,’ ” Mr. Downey said. “They’ve gotten very lazy and fat.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple releases major updates to leading products and pushes into new arenas.\\xa0Apple unveiled an array of major improvements to its iPhones, iPads and other leading products Wednesday, including a voice-activated television box that the company said would form “a new foundation for TV.” The updated Apple TV includes some hardware improvements, such as a remote control that allows users to easily navigate through entertainment options simply by speaking to Siri, Apple’s voice assistant. But perhaps the device’s more significant feature is its ability to function as a game console, which could set up the company to enter a new arena in living room entertainment. Apple said several major gaming software companies are making versions of popular titles for Apple TV. The new device will also come with its own app store, allowing third-party developers to shape how consumers get entertainment and videos on their televisions. Apple also showed how to use the best screen in the house to look at rooms for rent on Airbnb’s Web site or homes for sale on Zillow. That was one of several story lines during Apple’s presentation in San Francisco. The electronics giant also introduced a new tablet — a $799 iPad Pro — aimed at business clients, as well as new software on its watch and other mobile devices that Apple said would revolutionize how doctors and patients interact. At one point, the audience of several thousand reporters and Apple employees at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium was shown how a pregnant woman could record her fetus\\'s heartbeat and send the sound in a live stream to her doctor. Apple also updated its most important product, the iPhone, which accounts for 56 percent of the company’s sales. The new iPhone 6S and its larger cousin, the 6S Plus, have 12-megapixel cameras, sharper screens and a feature called 3D Touch, which brings up different menus depending on how hard a user presses the screen. \\xa0Apple also introduced a new iPad Pro, which has a display area roughly twice that of the iPad Air and is largely aimed at businesses. The tablet can be bought with a keyboard and has a beefier processor that can run heavy programs such as Microsoft Office. And, indeed, to tout the device, Apple invited executives from Microsoft, its former rival, to show how the popular office suite would work on the iPad. Also on stage were executives from Adobe, another software company Apple in the past has criticized for lax security. And in another move that broke with the past, Apple displayed a new stylus for the iPad Pro that it called the Apple Pencil, a product that likely would have been blocked by the company’s late co-founder Steve Jobs, who in 2010 mocked companies that offered styluses to consumers\\n\\n\\nApple phone, tablet and TV fail to impress investors.\\xa0Apple unveiled a new TV set top box that responds to voice commands and fresh iPhones that sense the pressure of a finger tap, changes which underwhelmed many social media commenters and investors. The new 6S and 6S Plus versions of the iPhone, Apple\\'s biggest money maker, are the same size as the previous versions but come with a better camera, faster chips, new colors and the force-sensitive \"3D Touch\". Speaking before thousands of analysts, journalists and frequently cheering Apple employees, Chief Executive Tim Cook also brought on stage an executive from onetime archrival Microsoft \\xa0to illustrate the business-friendly credentials of a big new iPad, the Pro. Apple shares fell 1.9 percent to $110.15 by the close, replicating the recent history of such rollouts but also reflecting the lack of any transformative products that could jumpstart the company\\'s sales ahead of the crucial holiday season. Apple shares have lost an average of 0.4 percent on the day of iPhone announcements over the past three years, according to BTIG Research data\\n\\n\\nGoogle is chasing Amazon Web Services in a new area –- providing access to “on-demand” supercomputing resources.\\xa0On Wednesday, Google announced the general availability of something called pre-emptible virtual machines, which amount to computing resources you can rent for very little. The service, first announced in May, enables people to buy computer processing that Google isn’t using at a steep discount, provided the customer is willing to yield the resources on short notice. A.W.S. has a similar short-term usage program, called Spot Instances. It lends itself to supercomputing exercises, particularly for universities and companies that don’t want to buy multimillion-dollar machines of their own, and has been used in areas like drug discovery and learning about new materials. The addition of Google as a competitor is likely to increase the number of ways these resources are used while lowering prices. Google also appears to be stressing its skills in machine learning, a powerful tool for finding new patterns in large data sets. Using Google, cancer researchers at the Broad Institute used 51,200 computing cores to look at the interrelationships between human genes, the billions of ways they are expressed, the cell lines from some 500 types of cancer, and molecules that perturb those cells. The idea was to sort through billions of data points quickly, looking for promising areas for researchers to seek drugs and treatments. The analysis, which on a single computer server would have run about 30 years, took a couple of hours, said Chris Dwan, the acting director of Information Technology at Broad. It cost about $4,000. “This isn’t like computing a few taxi trips,” said Mr. Dwan. “This is really heavy computing in complex biological systems, steering research.” He added, “the rules of how we work are being completely rewritten.”\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s Like PayPal But Pays Interest, and India\\'s Banks Are Afraid.\\xa0That’s a concern for the nation’s largest banks, because 40 percent of the money they lend comes from millions of small depositors like Mungekar. If more like her start shifting to digital money, they risk draining those deposits. Last month, the Reserve Bank of India gave licenses to 11 entities to operate so-called payment banks that will function a lot like PayPal in the U.S, but with a distinction -- customers can get interest on the money they leave there. Payment banks can’t lend and can only invest the client’s money in the safest government securities. Their revenue comes from a small commission on each transaction. Their new licences are part of central bank Governor Raghuram Rajan’s mission to cut the nation’s addiction to cash and to increase efficiency at the banks. PayTM started off as a service for adding credit to burner phones, and has evolved into the country’s largest e-wallet repository, allowing customers to pay utility bills, buy bus tickets and pay for Uber rides. Now it plans to build on its base of urban middle-class clientele to become a pseudo bank -- accepting deposits, offering peer-to-peer money transfers, even providing a debit card for cash withdrawals. The payment banking license was the first step. E-Wallets may be attractive for people wary of sharing their bank or card details on the Internet. They also make it easier to reward customers with discounts and offers redeemable at online or brick-and-mortar outlets. Apart from One97, other payment bank licensees include three large telecom operators, industrial conglomerates, the state-owned postal service, and billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries, which plans to run its venture with State Bank of India.\\n\\n\\nMobile payments company Square may hold IPO in fourth quarter:\\xa0Bloomberg. Mobile payments company Square may file for an initial public offering by the fourth quarter of this year, although the timing depends on market conditions, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter and its current chief executive, has assured investors and key employees that he will also remain Square\\'s chief executive, Bloomberg said. At this point, the timing of Square\\'s IPO is more contingent on market conditions than on whether Dorsey remains its CEO, Bloomberg said.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

Facebook wants Pages to actually earn money for the 45 million small businesses that use them. So today Facebook is upgrading Pages with a tabbed mobile layout that lets them display storefront “Sections” where users can “Shop” for products or view a list of “Services” the business offers. The company is also making calls to action on business Pages, such as “Call Now,” “Send Message” and “Contact Us,” bigger, more colorful and more prominent beneath the cover image. The “Shop” section will include Buy buttons powered by Facebook’s partnership with Shopify so users can check out without leaving the social network. Facebook is also testing Buy buttons that link out to a business’ traditional website. These changes are the biggest made to Pages since 2012. They build on Facebook’s recent announcement of new messaging capabilities for businesses and badges for companies that respond quickly. Today’s updates could make Facebook Pages a utility, not just a presence for businesses.\\xa0Andrew Chau, the co-founder of the Boba Guys cafe, tells me he started the business’ online presence with a Facebook Page not a website because that’s where it could get “the most eyeballs”. He says he tells people to ‘Check us out on Facebook’ rather than ‘Download our app’ because “they aren’t going to do that”. People don’t necessarily want a whole app just for their local tea shop. The strategy is similar to WeChat’s platform for businesses in China. Rather than having to build an app, get people to download it, and then get them to use it, WeChat lets businesses create “official accounts” that users can easily follow and buy from.\\xa0The average boutique owner or plumber shouldn’t have to learn how to build an app. Now they don’t.\\nYahoo may have to pay taxes on Alibaba spinoff:\\xa0Yahoo is reconsidering its plan to spin off its $23 billion stake in Alibaba after federal tax authorities declined to rule in advance on whether the transaction would mean huge capital gains taxes for Yahoo or its shareholders. Yahoo disclosed in a securities filing on Tuesday that the Internal Revenue Service told the company on Sept. 2 that it would not provide any guidance about the tax liability related to the spinoff ahead of the deal. The Internet company said that its own tax advisers still believed the spinoff of its 15 percent stake in Alibaba, a leading Chinese e-commerce company, would be tax-free, in part because it would be bundling a small-business division with the Alibaba stock into a new company called Aabaco Holdings. However, Yahoo said its board was now considering its options in light of the I.R.S. decision. Analysts say Yahoo’s options could include restructuring the spinoff or selling all or part of its 15 percent stake in Alibaba. Yahoo shareholders have been eagerly awaiting the spinoff, which analysts say accounts for far more of Yahoo’s stock price than its core advertising business. The Alibaba spinoff was intended to be a reward to Yahoo’s long-suffering shareholders. “It’s a big setback for Mayer,” said Eric Jackson, founder of the investment fund Ironfire Capital, who has been agitating for Yahoo to do more to unlock the value of its assets. “This was going to be the one feather in her cap, and now it’s seemingly not going to happen.” If Yahoo proceeds without the I.R.S. opinion, it may ultimately have to defend its move in court. An I.R.S. auditor, reviewing the company’s books several years down the road, could declare that the spinoff was taxable. Yahoo would probably go to court to challenge the decision, and Mr. Willens said the company would most likely prevail. Analysts have estimated that the company would owe about $9 billion in taxes if the transaction were fully taxable. In structuring the spinoff, Yahoo proposed to transfer that liability to Aabaco. So in theory, Ms. Mayer could proceed with the spinoff and focus on running Yahoo, leaving Aabaco shareholders to bear the risk of an audit.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba’s $141 Billion Slide Boosts Tencent to Biggest in Asia:\\xa0Alibaba surrendered the title of Asia’s largest Internet company to Tencent Holdings Ltd., capping a 10-month slide for the e-commerce giant that wiped $140.7 billion from its market value. The shares of Alibaba fell 4.7 percent to $60.91 at the close in New York on Tuesday, making the online marketplace worth $153 billion. That’s below Tencent’s value for the first time since billionaire Jack Ma oversaw Alibaba’s record-breaking initial public offering in September 2014. Alibaba’s reliance on consumer spending in China, where it gets 83 percent of its revenue, leaves it vulnerable to the domestic slowdown. Tencent is adding pressure by buying Hollywood content for its video platform, investing in cloud computing and on-demand mobile services, while forging an e-commerce alliance with JD.com. China may have lent its shares a hand. Last month, the government cut rates for the fifth time since November and resumed intervening in equities, seeking to arrest a stock market rout that wiped out trillions of dollars in value. That’s helped prop up stocks in neighboring Hong Kong. Tencent posted record quarterly profit in August. By comparison, Alibaba trailed analysts’ revenue forecasts in two of the past four quarters, and its sales grew at the slowest pace in at least three years. Tencent is capitalizing on the more than 1 billion users of WeChat and QQ. Billionaire Chairman Ma Huateng is finding new ways to make money through advertising, payment services and health care through the apps. Tencent earns more than half its revenue from games, and in April invested $126 million in San Francisco-based Glu Mobile Inc. to add a portfolio of action and role-playing games for smartphones.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba lowers second-quarter gross merchandise volume estimates.\\xa0Alibaba said on Tuesday it expected second-quarter gross merchandise volume (GMV) to be lower than its initial estimates due to weaker consumer spending in China. The company\\'s shares reversed course and slipped as much as 3.1 percent to $61.91 in late afternoon trading. They had earlier gained as much as 4.5 percent. Alibaba said it now expects GMV to be lower in mid-single digits on a percentage basis from its earlier estimates.\\xa0Up to Friday\\'s close, the company\\'s shares had fallen about 39 percent this year.\\n\\n\\nRestaurant of the Future? Service With an Impersonal Touch\\xa0There’s a new quinoa restaurant in San Francisco — yes, quinoa restaurants are a thing in San Francisco, so that’s not what’s noteworthy. At this restaurant, customers order, pay and receive their food and never interact with a person. The restaurant, Eatsa, the first outlet in a company with national ambitions, is almost fully automated. There are no waiters or even an order taker behind a counter. There is no counter. There are unseen people helping to prepare the food, but there are plans to fully automate that process, too, if it can be done less expensively than employing people. For optimists, it’s a way to make restaurant-going more efficient and less expensive. For pessimists, it’s the latest example of how machines are stealing people’s jobs. Either way, it’s like heaven for misanthropes, or those who are in too much of a hurry to chat with a server. The quinoa — stir-fried, with arugula, parsnips and red curry — tasted quite good. Whether a restaurant that employs few people is good for the economy is another question. Restaurants, especially fast-food restaurants, have traditionally been a place where low-skilled workers can find employment. Most of the workers are not paid much, though in San Francisco employers of a certain size must pay health benefits and in 2018 a minimum wage of $15. Mr. Friedberg said that was not the reason his team automated so many roles. “Technology allows us to completely rethink how people get their food,” he said. Automation is transforming every industry. Business owners look to substitute machines for human labor. It happened to blue-collar workers in factories and white-collar workers in banks and even law firms. With self-driving vehicles, it may happen in the taxi and trucking industries. Robots and artificial intelligence machines are expected to transform health care. Automation, in rudimentary forms, is already part of many restaurants. Reservations are made online, orders arrive at the kitchen electronically, and bills are paid with a swipe on an iPad. Chains like Chili’s and airport restaurants use tablet computers for ordering and paying, to speed the process and cut personnel costs. It might be a harbinger of a future in which eating out no longer involves waiters. Restaurants with servers could become the novelty, reserved for occasions when you want more ambience and hands-on attention than Eatsa’s “food delivery system.”\\n\\n\\nNetflix May Be Setting Its Sights on Four More Asian Markets:\\xa0Netflix will enter Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea early next year, according to a press release that was posted in Chinese on its website and taken down. The online offering will include movies, TV shows and content suitable for children, according to the statement. Additional details on pricing and programs will be announced later, the statement said. The company didn’t respond to requests for comment. Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, is racing to complete a global expansion by the end of next year. The company’s growth prospects have made the stock the top performer in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index this year (The stock has risen 95 percent this year), with subscribers exceeding 65 million in 50 countries. Still, the shares have pulled back in recent weeks, in part due to concern over increased competition for viewer’s dollars. Time Warner’s HBO, Hulu and Amazon.com have all boosted their online offerings this year, while Apple is considering its own video streaming service. Netflix introduced service in Japan Sept. 2, starting at $5.40 a month.\\n\\n\\nTiVo revenue beats estimates on subscriptions rise:\\xa0Digital video recorder maker TiVo Inc reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly revenue, helped by higher subscriptions. The company\\'s total subscriptions rose about 26 percent to more than 6 million in the second quarter ended July 31. Net revenue rose to $119.5 million from $111.9 million. Revenue from Tivo\\'s services and software and technology businesses rose about 14 percent to $99.1 million, while analysts had expected $96 million. \\xa0The stock was flat in extended trading on Tuesday. TiVo\\'s set-top boxes are in high demand from cable users as they also allow access to online video services such as Netflix Inc, Hulu and Google Inc\\'s YouTube. Tivo sells subscriptions directly to customers with its video recorders and also licenses its technology to cable TV operators that rent recorders to subscribers. The company, whose clients include DirecTV, is trying to partner with more cable TV operators to grow its business. Tivo sells its products through cable TV partners such as Virgin Media in the UK, ONO in Spain and Com Hem AB in Sweden.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHow will autonomous cars deal with insurance liabilities? By shifting them toward manufacturers, says a study:\\xa0Hacker attacks or faulty software could shift the burden of legal and regulatory liability toward makers of self-driving cars and away from customers, experts say, forcing regulators and insurers to develop new models. Autonomous cars have the potential to reduce the rate of traffic accidents as sensors and software give a car faster and better reflexes to prevent a collision. However, a greater level of automation increases the need for cyber security and sophisticated software, experts said. \"Although accident rates will theoretically fall, new risks will come with autonomous vehicles,\" said Domenico Savarese, Group head of Proposition Development and Telematics at Zurich Insurance. \"What should be done in the case of a faulty software algorithm? Should manufacturers be required to monitor vehicles post-sale in the case of a malfunction or a hacker attack?\" Savarese asked. While established models for assigning liability - such as holding the owner responsible for what the car does - will still be relevant, the onus may shift toward manufacturers. Greater automation may also change consumer behavior and affect insurance costs if drivers become less vigilant and less practiced in their ability to avert an accident. \"Could a manufacturer become liable if a distracted driver causes an accident while relying on autopilot? It\\'s too early to tell,\" Savarese said, adding that increased liability would unlikely deter carmakers since customers were demanding more self-driving functions. Software and connected cars are creating new opportunities for insurance companies to customize policies to clients. \"You could pay for how much you drive, or get a lower premium based on how well you drive,\" Savarese said, adding that these policies will only be made possible if the client allows the insurer to monitor them. Without driver consent, the insurer will have no right to spy on the driver, not even for exceeding the speed limit. If customers buy in to the idea of lower premiums in exchange for higher monitoring, they can opt to have some sort of black box device installed in their car or via their smartphone.\\n\\n\\nOkta Is Now a Unicorn After $75 Million Funding Round.\\xa0Okta, the startup that helps companies manage their sign-in information for hundreds of cloud services and business software applications, has landed a $75 million round of funding at an implied valuation of $1.2 billion. The investment is coming from existing investors, including the venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock Partners and Sequoia Capital. Total capital raised is now $230 million. It has been about 15 months since Okta last raised money. Last year it took a $75 million round led by Sequoia that valued the company at about $600 million. Sequoia is a significant investor, having also led Okta’s D round in 2013 and its C round in 2012. Okta is also notable for being Andreessen Horowitz’s first investment in the cloud software area back in 2010 when the firm led its A round. Since then the company has expanded into new lines of business, including helping companies manage their mobile devices.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon plans to sell $50 tablet: WSJ. Online retailer Amazon.com Inc plans to release a $50 tablet in time for the holiday season, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The 6-inch screen tablet comes with a mono speaker and is priced much lower than Amazon\\'s Fire tablet, the cheapest variant of which is sold at $99. The company was not immediately available for comment. Amazon also plans to release 8-inch and 10-inch screen tablets, the report said. While other Amazon Fire tablets show advertisements as screen savers, it was not clear if the new 6-inch tablet\\'s cost included ads, according to the report.\\n\\n\\nApple\\'s New Ad Blockers Threaten to Remove Publishers\\' Mobile Ads:\\xa0When Apple unveils its new iPhone and iOS 9 operating system this week, it could also drop a bomb on publishers, introducing ad-blocking technology that threatens to impact the revenue they make from smartphones. Ad blockers have been available on desktop browsers for years, but analysts say Apple\\'s backing has the potential to make ad blocking more mainstream, making it available to a wider group of consumers. With Apple\\'s new tools, developers can build ad-blocking apps that consumers can download to wipe out ads on mobile sites. Run-of-the-mill ads like banners and display placements are easy targets for ad blockers. But a small test by Adweek of a handful of apps shows that they remove native and branded content, too—putting the business model of publishers that have been at the forefront of native advertising—including BuzzFeed, Business Insider, Forbes and The Atlantic—at risk.\\n\\n\\nDidi Kuaidi raises $3 billion as rival Uber China brings in $1.2 billion. Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Kuaidi is set to raise about $3 billion through its latest fundraising round, said two people familiar with the matter, just as funding at the Chinese unit of rival Uber reaches $1.2 billion. The inflow of cash raises the stakes between two of the world\\'s most valuable start-ups. It also illustrates how investors are undeterred by the two companies spending heavily as they subsidize rides to gain market share, betting on China\\'s Internet-linked transport market becoming the world\\'s biggest. Didi Kuaidi, which has the largest market share of car-hailing apps in China, in July said it raised $2 billion, and that the amount may rise another \"few hundred million\" due to what it said was tremendous interest from global investors.\\n\\n\\nOne of Bollywood\\'s biggest studios is betting it can win the online streaming race.\\xa0Encouraged by an activist investor, the executive chairman of Eros International Plc is making its Eros Now streaming service a priority -- shelving a plan to create an old-fashioned television network to focus on video-on-demand optimized for mobile devices and priced for widespread adoption. The idea is to use the Mumbai studio’s bulging catalog of more than 2,000 films and new, exclusive series to build a critical mass of devoted users before Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. plant their flags in the world’s second-most populous country. “We thought, ‘We have the market share, we have the movies,”’ Lulla, 53, said in his London office on the city’s Georgian-era Manchester Square, looking every bit the mogul in a crisp, open-necked white shirt and slip-on shoes. “Why don’t we create our own platform?” Thanks to a production machine built by his father Arjan, who founded Eros in 1977, it releases upwards of 70 movies a year -- more than any U.S. rival. Eros is “exactly where Netflix wants to be in the next three to five years,” Lulla said. “I’m already there.” \\xa0Since a largely marketing-free soft launch about a year ago, Eros Now has attracted more than 26 million users. The official hard-sell unveiling was in July, with promises that movies will be available to stream immediately after they hit theaters. Promotions tease new digital series including “Khel,” a drama about “the twisted characters that populate the world of cricket,” and “Ponniyin Selvan,” based on a 2,000-plus-page novel about an ancient Tamil kingdom. A basic, ad-supported tier is free, while premium services cost from 50 rupees (about 80 U.S. cents) to 100 rupees monthly. Prices are higher outside India, where there’s opportunity in diaspora communities. In the U.S. it’s $7.99 -- which happens to be Netflix’s base cost.\\n\\n\\nSamsung to Cut 10% of Headquarters Staff, Economic Daily Says.\\xa0Samsung Electronics is preparing to cut 10 percent of workers at its headquarters, according to a Korean newspaper, as the world’s biggest smartphone maker loses sales to Apple and Chinese vendors. Samsung is targeting workers in the human resources, public relations and finance departments, Korea Economic Daily reported Tuesday, citing people it didn’t identify. The Suwon, South Korea-based company also plans to cut some expenses next year, the report added. Samsung declined to comment in an e-mail. The moves come after new high-end Galaxy smartphones failed to impress consumers, triggering five straight monthly declines and wiping out more than $40 billion in Samsung’s market value since April. The company’s share of global smartphone shipments fell more than 3 percentage points in the second quarter, and it’s no longer the top seller in China, the world’s biggest mobile-phone market. Samsung, which had 206.2 trillion won ($171 billion) in sales last year, is estimated to post about 200.2 trillion won in sales this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\\n\\n\\nBaidu to Boost Spending on India, Indonesia as Mobile Sales Boom:\\xa0Baidu plans to boost investments in India and Indonesia as China’s largest Web search provider tries for a greater presence on smartphones. “They have a lot of characteristics that mimic China’s development,” Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Li said during an interview in Beijing on Monday. “There is no legacy of PC user behavior and probably mobile is going to have a very speedy development.” Baidu is spending on new businesses while locked in competition with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. In July, Baidu forecast sales below estimates, and Chairman Robin Li pledged to tap its $12 billion of cash to build out its shopping, taxi and delivery services amid China’s economic slowdown. China saw its first decline in smartphone shipments in six years during the first quarter, while India’s shipment volume surged 44 percent in the second quarter. India is now the world’s third-largest smartphone market. During the past two years, Baidu spent almost $1 billion on more than 20 investments, including Uber, travel website Qunar and video-streaming service iQiyi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company is now exploring investments in the local education and medical sectors, Li said. The spending likely will be small, with Baidu interested in minority stakes as well as full acquisitions, she said. Baidu also is keen to make use of its relationships with educational institutions by providing student loans, President Zhang Ya-Qin said in a separate interview. It has issued 100 million yuan ($15.7 million) in loans, averaging 20,000 yuan each, since starting its lending program last month, he said.\\n\\n\\nFacebook’s Messenger And The Challenge To Google’s Search Dominance.\\xa0When Facebook announced M—an A.I.-powered personal assistant that lives inside Messenger—it fired a massive shell across Google’s bow. Indeed, if Facebook can successfully scale M to its entire audience (and WhatsApp’s, as well), this new product represents a direct assault on search and AdWords—the lifeblood of Google’s business. To understand how a digital personal assistant that lives inside a mobile messaging app represents a disruptive threat to Google, let’s look at why Google is in this situation in the first place. Google faces the classic innovator’s dilemma: somewhere in the recesses of its collective corporate mind, Google knows that keyword search—the current foundation of its empire—is not the future. Because Larry Page and Sergey Brin are visionaries, they know that the next-generation solution to the problem of search looks less like a clickable list of links and more like a primitive Star Trek computer or an early version of the A.I. from the movie Her. The future of search is an intelligent digital assistant that can complete tasks. Like Google today, the search engine of the future will be able to mine the vast expanses of the internet for relevant information and deliver it to you in milliseconds. But much unlike today’s Google, the future’s search engine will behave like a digital personal assistant that can understand and predict your needs, then deliver on them without requiring you to navigate to any web pages or tap around a bunch of apps. When you do ask for something, this search engine will not respond with a list of blueish links. Instead, it will respond with a definitive result or a completed task. When it doesn’t have the definitive result or can’t complete the task on the first pass, it will ask you further questions to get closer and closer, until the machine gets it right. it’s not yet clear if Larry Page and Sergey Brin would be willing to invest in an Alphabet spin-off that threatened to kill their golden goose: the risks are just so big, and the scale of the rewards so uncertain. Meanwhile, Siri remains a wildcard, Facebook is testing M, Microsoft is bringing Cortana to Android, and Slack is making a long-term run at the A.I. assistant game, too. This is why they call it a dilemma.\\n\\n\\nAOL Scoops Up Mobile Ad Network Millennial Media for $238 Million:\\xa0AOL has acquired mobile ad network Millennial Media for $238 million, or about $1.75 per share. The Millennial deal is the newest step in building out AOL\\'s tools to compete in mobile advertising against behemoths like Facebook, Yahoo and Google. With the deal, Verizon-owned AOL is getting access to mobile inventory in Millennial\\'s 65,000 apps—equivalent to 1 billion active global users in markets like Germany, France and Japan. It will also help build out its cross-screen programmatic platform called One. AOL\\'s move is the latest sign of the times for mobile ad networks like Millennial (which spent more than $300 million on its own acquisitions in recent years) that have struggled in recent years to keep up in a fast-paced industry. With Millennial now off the table, it could set off a wave of other deals for tech companies to gobble up smaller mobile ad networks that specialize in video and location-based targeting. To stay ahead, Millennial zeroed in on building up its automated capabilities the past couple of years by acquiring two other big mobile players. In 2013, it bought real-time bidding platform Jumptap in for $209 million. Then in September 2014, Millennial acquired ad network Nexage for $107 million.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nZomato raises $60M from Temasek, Vy Capital, is a Unicorn now:\\xa0Restaurant listings and review firm Zomato, which is expanding its business into food ordering and table reservation, has entered the coveted ‘Unicorn Club’ as it has just raised $60 million (Rs 390 crore when it sealed the deal) in a fresh round of funding from Singapore government’s investment company Temasek and existing investor Vy Capital. Although it has not disclosed the valuation, back-of-the-envelope calculations show Zomato is now valued around $1 billion. This would make it one of the eight odd Indian unicorns, a tag meant for startups sporting over $1 billion valuation. Flipkart, Snapdeal, Ola, One97 Communications, InMobi, Quikr and Mu Sigma are the other known Unicorns from India. Though some of these firms were launched years ago, their current core business took shape just around five years back. For Zomato, this is its third round of funding since last November when it bagged $60 million and followed it up with another $50 million this April. It was valued at $660 million (post money) in November 2014.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle hopes to reenter China by fall: Google expects to return to mainland China as early as this fall following a five-year absence, tech website The Information reported on Friday. The company hopes to get Chinese government approval for a China version of its Play store mobile app, The Information reported, citing people familiar with the plan. The tech giant is also planning to extend support of a version of Android for wearable devices in the country, The Information cited one of the people as saying. Google has assured Chinese authorities that it will follow local laws and block Play store apps that the government deems objectionable, one person familiar with the plans told the website. The Play store app will only work on devices running the recently unveiled \"M\" version of Android, and only on devices that comply with China\\'s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology requirements, The Information reported. Google is also planning to offer new incentives to phone makers to upgrade Android phones to the latest versions of its operating system, one person familiar with the plans told the website.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNew Apple TV Is Said to Focus on Games, Challenging Traditional Consoles: Apple is expected to make games a primary selling point of its new Apple TV product, which is scheduled to be announced on Wednesday in San Francisco, according to people briefed on Apple’s plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity. This is a big change from Apple’s previous versions of Apple TV, a device shaped like a hockey puck that for the first eight years of its existence has mainly been used to stream videos and music. “I think Apple’s going to create a big new category in gaming, one that others have tried and failed to create before,” said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at the technology research firm Jackdaw Research. “What the Apple TV has the potential to do is to bring casual gaming to the living room and make it a much more social activity.” Most game executives and analysts see little chance that Apple will be able to woo hard-core fans of the leading high-end game consoles, the Xbox One from Microsoft and the PlayStation 4 from Sony — both of which will most likely still have better graphics than the new Apple TV. Gamers who fancy big-budget games like Call of Duty and Destiny will probably not be easily persuaded to switch systems. That still leaves a large market of casual gamers whom Apple could target with the new Apple TV: people who find traditional game controllers complicated and who enjoy lighter, less epic forms of content. The new product is expected to have a starting price around $150, according to the people briefed on the product. While that is more than double the price of the least expensive Apple TV on sale today, it is significantly less than the latest traditional game consoles, which range in price from $300 to $500, depending on the maker and configuration. The business opportunity for Apple could be huge. The company now takes nearly a third of the revenue from sales of any games and other software purchased in its app stores. Total revenue from console games is expected to be more than $27 billion this year, which is more than a third of the $75 billion global games business, according to estimates by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIreland Seen Losing Apple Tax Skirmish, Triggering Legal Battle: Ireland will probably face censure from European authorities within months in relation to its tax dealings with Apple Inc., according to a person with knowledge of the matter. A finding against Ireland will spark a legal battle that may last years, as the government is ready to fight the decision in the European Union Court of Justice, according to the person, who asked not to be named because the case is ongoing. In preliminary findings last year, European antitrust authorities said Apple’s tax arrangements were improperly designed to give the iPhone maker a financial boost in exchange for jobs in the country. Apple said in 2013 it had paid an effective tax rate of less than 2 percent in Ireland over the previous ten years. The EU inquiry comes amid a global crackdown on corporate tax-affairs, with the European Commission estimating that tax avoidance and evasion in the region cost about 1 trillion euros ($1.11 trillion) a year. In a worst-case scenario, Apple may face a $19 billion bill if the government in Dublin ultimately loses and is forced to recoup tax from the company, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Rod Hall.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle Dreams of a World After Apps but It’s a Nightmare for Rivals:\\xa0With one search algorithm tweak this week, Google rekindled deep-seated fears that it is doing its damnedest to nuke apps. Maybe. Google earns more money when people are on the mobile Web, not in apps. Publicly, the company has voiced support for solving the nagging problems of apps, discovery and dormancy. Internally, however, chatter is less about crippling apps than imagining a world beyond them. Conversations with people inside and recently departed from Google reveal that the company is spending considerable attention on what comes after mobile apps, and how Google can usher that era in. A primary vehicle for doing so is app indexing and deep linking, methods to tie content within and between apps. Apple and a host of Silicon Valley startups are doing this as well. But Google’s effort is unique in that it is wrapped tightly with search and artificial intelligence — and, like Google’s approach to the Web, it is all-encompassing in its scope. There are some hints of how Google envisions mobile evolving beyond apps. Now on Tap, its feature launching soon in Android, inserts Google’s personal assistant tech and search intel into apps that allow it, essentially allowing a more seamless transition from app to app on a phone. A chat in email about a movie, for instance, would jump quickly to the app of IMDB. Voice control plays a role in the app-less future, too. Several rivals, along with app publishers and ad sellers, interpreted Google’s move this week as hostile. “It’s basically Google starting to meddle with people’s products,” said Alex Austin, CEO of Branch Metrics, a deep-linking firm. Austin noted that with Google’s app indexing drive, it is pushing app creators to build mobile websites. “In an app world,” he said, “Google is nothing.”\\n\\nFacebook Takes a Step Into Education Software:\\xa0Facebook, which transformed communication with its social networking service, now wants to make a similar impact on education. The Silicon Valley company announced on Thursday that it was working with a local charter school network, Summit Public Schools, to develop software that schools can use to help children learn at their own pace. The project has been championed by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s co-founder and chief executive, and one of his top lieutenants, Chris Cox. The software allows students to work with teachers to create tailored lessons and projects. Teachers can also administer individualized quizzes that the software can grade and track. The platform, which is separate from the Facebook social network, is now being used by nine Summit schools and about 20 others. Ultimately, Ms. Tavenner said, “our motivation is to share it with everyone and anyone who wants it,” including other charters and public school districts. The software would be free for all users. Mike Sego, the Facebook engineering director running the Summit software project, said making money was not an immediate goal. “Whenever I ask Mark, ‘Do I need to think of this as business?’ he always pushes back and says, ‘That shouldn’t be a priority right now. We should just continue making this better.’ ”\\n\\nAmazon Announces Purchase of Video-Software Company Elemental:\\xa0Amazon is buying Elemental Technologies, a provider of technology for distributing videos to Web-connected devices, seeking to expand its portfolio of cloud-computing services. The online retailer paid about $500 million for Elemental, which helps media and entertainment providers reformat video made for cable, satellite and airwaves broadcast so that clips can be transmitted to desktop computers, smartphones and tablets. Amazon described the acquisition as a way to bring more video capabilities to Amazon Web Services, its Internet computing business. The Web retailer also offers movies and TV shows, which may also benefit from Elemental’s technology. Elemental has more than 700 media customers and supports over-the-top TV applications such as BBC’s iPlayer, CNNGo and ESPN ScoreCenter, and will continue to operate under its existing brand.\\n\\nExtra screen time drags down teenagers\\' exam grades, study finds:\\xa0Teenagers who spend an extra hour a day surfing the internet, watching TV or playing computer games risk performing two grades worse in exams than their peers who don\\'t, according to research by British scientists. An extra hour in front of the TV or online at age 14-and-a-half was linked with 9.3 fewer exam points at age 16 -- equivalent to two grades, for example from a B to a D. Two extra hours was linked to 18 fewer points. Unsurprisingly, the results also showed that pupils doing an extra hour of daily homework and reading scored better - getting on average 23.1 more points than their peers. The scientists said further research was needed to confirm the effect conclusively, but advised parents worried about their children\\'s grades to consider limiting screen time. In a breakdown analysis of different screen activities, the researchers found that TV came out as the most detrimental in terms of exam performance. In a study of more than 800 students aged 14 and 15, researchers from Cambridge University also found that physical activity had no effect on academic performance. Since this was a prospective study, in which the researchers followed the pupils over time to see how different behaviors affected performance, the scientists said it was reasonable to conclude that too much screen time reduced academic achievement.\\n\\nIndian Shopkeepers Help You Tap ‘Buy’:\\xa0Since 2013, at least $8.6 billion has poured into Indian e-commerce companies. The slice of the population that’s ever shopped online: 4 percent. As the country’s leading Internet bazaars—Flipkart, Snapdeal, and Amazon India—hawk wares to the urban, English-speaking middle class, they’re all but ignoring the 510 million working-age adults living in rural areas. “These people don’t trust an app or a website” even if they have a phone, says Krishna Lakamsani, founder of e-commerce startup IPay. “They will only buy from someone they know and trust.” That’s why IPay and rival StoreKing are recruiting local shopkeepers to sell online goods in their stores in exchange for commissions. By relying on merchants to persuade people to buy online, IPay says it moves about $1.6 million worth of merchandise each month through 6,000 shopkeepers’ tablets in India’s southern states; StoreKing sells $4.2 million through 10,000. The early returns are promising, even if they’re a sliver of Flipkart and Snapdeal, each of which says it sold $300 million worth of goods in June. Amazon wouldn’t disclose sales. For the shopkeepers, commissions range from 4 percent to 10 percent, and the tablets—$134 from IPay, $226 from StoreKing—quickly pay for themselves. During the eight months Panjala has had the IPay unit, he says, each day he’s done about $30 worth of business on it, one-seventh of his sales. Using shopkeepers to push the tablets means IPay and StoreKing don’t have to worry about training most customers to order through their apps. Because shipments get delivered to the shops, there’s less risk of losing goods on remote roads. And the buyers pay cash, so the companies don’t have to invest in electronic payment systems. “We’ve been generating operating profits from Day One,” says StoreKing Chief Executive Officer Sridhar Gundaiah. “That’s something none of the big e-commerce companies can boast of.” Amazon and Snapdeal say they’re experimenting with kiosks that also help customers buy online. StoreKing and IPay are creating a rural e-commerce market in India by selling via tablets in thousands of local stores.\\n\\nFacebook Makes It Easier To Optimize Ad Campaigns Based On Conversions:\\xa0Facebook is unveiling an improved version of its Conversion Lift measurement tool, which first launched in January. Previously, Facebook allowed you to measure whether your ad campaign was actually improving online and offline sales. Now, you can also test different ads to find the best approach. Conversion Lift previously looked at two groups — a group of users who saw the ad and a group who didn’t. It then compared each group’s conversion data (the data can be pulled from Facebook’s Custom Audiences pixel, an in-store point-of-sale system and elsewhere), which should reflect whether an ad actually succeeded in driving sales. With the improved Conversion Lift tool, advertisers can compare multiple test and control groups. That means they can see which ad units are delivering the best results, compare brand and direct response ads, see how mobile ads are performing compared to the rest of the campaign or compare ads featuring product versus lifestyle-format photos. For example, website builder Wix compared a group that saw only direct response ads with another group that saw direct response and video ads. It turned out that the combined of formats did a better job of improving premium subscription signups — that group saw uplift of 7.4 percent, compared to the DR-only group, which saw uplift of 6.8 percent. Also part of the update: Conversion Lift can now look at how ads improve in-app sales, as well, so that app developers aren’t just optimizing campaigns to deliver the most downloads, but instead focus on improving revenue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMotorola Challenges Apple With a New Moto 360 Smartwatch:\\xa0With the second generation collection of Moto 360 smartwatches, Motorola is doubling down on design while claiming that it has drastically improved on the technical side, too. The new Moto 360 isn\\'t a single watch with a few small variations, as the first edition was. This watch comes in three basic variations, each with a number of customizable details. Two watches are intended for men, one that\\'s 46 millimeters across and a second that\\'s 42mm. They take 24mm and 20mm straps, respectably. Because the watches have lugs this year (the bits that jut out to hold the strap), all 360 models can use any properly sized watch straps, not just those from Motorola. There is also a special women\\'s watch, which is still 42mm but uses slimmer 16mm straps to give the illusion of a smaller size. The watches have premium look that comes with a premium price tag: from $299. By comparison, the 2014 Moto 360 currently starts at $149. Since Android Wear now works with the iPhone, Motorola seems to be positioning this smartwatch in direct opposition to the Apple Watch, and doubling the price now puts the Moto 360 in the same bracket as the Apple Watch Sport—and still well below the tariff for the standard Apple Watch.\\n\\nTwitter CEO Search Gains Urgency as Stock Slips, Executives Exits:\\xa0Pressure on Twitter’s board is mounting. In the three months since the company started searching for a new chief executive officer, the stock has slipped 22 percent and several product executives have left. A leading internal candidate, according to people close to the board, is interim leader and co-founder Jack Dorsey -- who’s already CEO at a company on the verge of an initial public offering. Twitter’s board didn’t have a succession plan in place when former CEO Dick Costolo departed, even though it wasn’t a surprise exit. That means they’re doing the search with the public knowing it’s happening, opening themselves up to scrutiny about their every move, Pozner said. “The board needs to take some action and communicate it to shareholders,” she said. “There’s a huge amount of uncertainty, which creates a really uncomfortable feeling for shareholders and internal stakeholders.” Twitter’s share price has been lingering for the past month around the $26 price investors paid in its initial public offering in November 2013. Part of the selloff was triggered by Dorsey, who bluntly stated after the company’s second-quarter earnings report in July that it will take a while before Twitter is able to reverse a slowdown in growth. He called its product performance “unacceptable.”\\n\\nAmazon\\'s \\'Dash\\' button now effectively free:\\xa0Amazon said its \\'Dash\\' button, which allows customers to place orders instantly, will now be effectively free. The company\\'s Prime members can now buy the button for $4.99 and get the amount discounted on their first purchase using the button, the e-commerce giant said on Wednesday. The button will now be available to all Prime members - those paying $99 a year for two-day delivery and other benefits. The company said it will add 11 more brands to the button, bringing the total to 29. The \\'Dash\\' button, launched earlier this year, allows Amazon\\'s Prime members to order a product with just a push, using a WiFi connection, and can be hung or hooked anywhere in the home.\\n\\nTwitter announces global expansion of self-service ads platform:\\xa0Microblogging website operator Twitter Inc said it had expanded its self-service ads platform to more than 200 countries and territories from 33 countries. Small and medium-sized businesses can now reach their target audiences on Twitter in 15 languages, Twitter said in a blog post on Wednesday. The company said it had about 100,000 advertisers.\\n\\nCapillary raises $45M from Warburg Pincus, others:\\xa0Bangalore-based Capillary Technologies, a SaaS-based CRM solutions provider, has secured around $45 million in a fresh round of funding led by private equity firm Warburg Pincus. Its existing investors Sequoia Capital and Norwest Venture Partners have also participated in the round. It added that the fresh round of investment has more than doubled the valuation of the company to about Rs 1,200 crore and that Capillary has already used the funds to acquire two startups: MartJack, a digital commerce solution company owned by Reasoning Global eApplications and machine learning startup Ruaha Labs. The company had also picked up a minority stake in customer satisfaction management firm CloudCherry recently. Capillary was set up in August 2008 by IIT Kharagpur alumni Reddy, Krishna Mehra and Ajay Modani. It is into cloud-based software solutions that help retailers engage with customers through mobile, social and in-store channels.\\n\\nWill GIF-Powered Emails Get More People RSVP\\'ing for Events? Splash and Giphy say the numbers point to yes:\\xa0GIFs have already overtaken brands\\' social media and online video. Next up: Email marketing. Event-planning platform Splash and Giphy—a GIF library and search engine—are teaming up today to let marketers plug GIFs into the emails and landing pages that Splash uses to organize gatherings and RSVP lists. Crafting perfect email and event campaigns that get someone\\'s attention is tough these days, and Splash CEO Ben Hindman said the partnership will shake up the dry and un-personalized campaigns marketers are known for sending clients. Adding GIFs to emails isn\\'t particularly new (Giphy also plugs into Gmail and MailChimp\\'s software) but it does show how event marketers are pulling in all kinds of bells and whistles to cut through the massive clutter of emails. Giphy\\'s software is baked into Splash so that users upload a GIF to an email or landing page template like they would add a photo. Then they type in a keyword to find an animated loop. The partnership is the latest in a surprisingly long list of ways that brands can plug Giphy loops into their marketing. Here are four other ways digital marketers can add GIFs to their campaigns through Giphy\\'s tools: 1. Mobile messaging: Giphy powers the animated loops inside apps like Kik, Facebook Messenger and Verizon Messages. 2. Wordpress and RebelMouse: Giphy\\'s technology plugs into blog posts. 3. TV: Brands can turn on Giphy TV to stitch loops together so that they take over an entire browser window to scroll endlessly. 4. Twitch: Game-minded marketers can talk to fans in chat rooms with animated videos.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle will Penalize App-Install Ads in Search Rankings:\\xa0Google is on a mission to clean up the mobile Web and make it comport to its vision of the world. In April, the search engine tweaked its search algorithm to favor sites it deemed “mobile-friendly” — a shift the industry dubbed “mobilegeddon”. Now Google is adding another metric for mobile friendliness: The absence of ads that take over a screen and push an app. Starting today, those ads will be included in the mobile test Google gives publishers. Then, starting Nov. 1, sites that carry those ads will be punished in search rankings. Daniel Bathgate, a Google search engineer, explained the rationale in a post: “Our analysis shows that it is not a good search experience and can be frustrating for users because they are expecting to see the content of the Web page.” For Google, the changes are geared specifically at search results, part of its ongoing effort to make querying on mobile better. The changes will only affect sites pushing app-install ads in search results, so they don’t restrict the ads within apps. Also, the tweak won’t hit full-screen blasts that promote other publisher treats, like email newsletters or the ‘Like us on Facebook’ pages that digital publications such as Vice and Fusion use. Thus far, there’s some evidence that Google’s attempt to improve the quality of mobile websites has improved its ability to make money from them.\\n\\nHow Does Amazon Choose Which Listings get the Buy Box?:\\xa0Unfortunately, Amazon doesn’t release the algorithm it uses to award the Buy Box, and there’s no way to buy your way into that spot. Yes, maintaining a low price contributes to earning that precious real estate, but a few other strategies can increase your chances of getting there: Become a High-Rated Seller: Demand a high level of customer satisfaction from yourself and your team, and keep your seller metrics high. Maintain Available Quantity: Monitor your quantity levels and always keep enough inventory to meet demand. Build a Successful Sales History: Develop a track record of converting sales and providing quality customer service. Lower Your Refund Rate: Fulfill orders quickly and efficiently, and ensure your product descriptions are accurate. Earn Positive Customer Feedback: Solicit feedback and resolve any negative responses immediately. Reduce A-to-Z Guarantee Claims: Manage each claim quickly, and issue refunds where necessary. Participate in Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA): FBA can handle your fulfillment and customer service elements, so you can focus on other aspects of your business.\\n\\nOffline Viewing of Video From Amazon Prime Streaming:\\xa0Amazon said it would allow members of its $99 annual Prime loyalty program free downloads of some shows and movies from its streaming video service to watch offline, or when no Internet connection is available. The programs will be available via the Amazon Video app for iOS or Android. Shows will be downloadable to Apple and Android phones and tablets, including Amazon’s Fire devices — but not to desktops or laptops. Available programs include “Downton Abbey” and “The Good Wife,” HBO shows including “Girls” and “Veep” and movies including “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire” and “The Wolf of Wall Street.” Amazon has been expanding services for Prime members, including its Prime Instant Video service, to attract more subscribers to the annual program. Netflix said it had no plans to follow suit.\\n\\nNew iOS malware should make you think twice about jailbreaking your iPhone:\\xa0Information about the Apple accounts of more than 200,000 iPhone users who \"jailbroke\" their phones has been stolen by cybercriminals who could use the data to lock the phones and hold them for ransom, according to Palo Alto Networks, a cybersecurity research firm. The malware behind the digital theft, dubbed \"KeyRaider,\" has \"successfully stolen over 225,000 valid Apple accounts and thousands of certificates, private keys, and purchasing receipts,\" Palo Alto researchers said in a blog post. The stolen data appears to have been downloaded to an insecure server where hackers can easily gain access to it, the researchers said. The problem appears to be isolated to phones that were altered to bypass Apple\\'s attempts to keep users safe. Apple keeps tight control over what apps are allowed on iPhones, running basic security tests before allowing them to be downloaded. But some iPhone users have bristled at such restrictions, and to escape them, some people \"jailbreak\" their phones -- taking steps to get around restrictions built into the devices so can they install things not available in the official App Store.\\n\\nIndian woman who sued Uber over rape accusation ends lawsuit:\\xa0A woman who sued Uber after accusing one of its drivers of raping her in India has voluntarily ended her lawsuit against the company, according to a court filing on Tuesday. The passenger, who reported being raped and beaten after hailing a ride with the Uber driver in Delhi last year, sued the online car service in a U.S. federal court in January, claiming the company failed to maintain basic safety procedures. The driver was arrested by Indian police and appeared in court in December. Uber\\'s Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick at the time called the incident \"horrific\" and pledged to help \"bring this perpetrator to justice.\" However, Uber also argued in court filings that the woman sued the wrong corporate entity as the driver had a contract with Uber B.V., a Netherlands-based entity with no U.S. operations. The court filing did not disclose any details on how the case was settled, and representatives for Uber and the woman declined to commen\\n\\nThis Company Is Still Making Audio Cassettes and Sales Are Better Than Ever:\\xa0The audiocassette tape is not dead. In fact, one Springfield, Mo., cassette maker says it has had its best year since it opened in 1969. “You can characterize our operating model as stubbornness and stupidity. We were too stubborn to quit,” said National Audio Company President Steve Stepp. NAC is the largest and one of the few remaining manufacturers of audiocassettes in the U.S. The profitable company produced more than 10 million tapes in 2014 and sales are up 20 percent this year. “Probably the thing that has really enlarged our business at a faster phase than anything is the retro movement,” Stepp said. \"There\\'s the nostalgia of holding the audio cassette in your hand.” NAC has deals with major record labels like Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group as well as a number of small contracts with indie bands. About 70 percent of the company’s sales are from music cassettes while the rest are blank cassettes. “There was a drive from the independent bands to get that warm analog sound again, and it just continued to grow and grow,” said NAC Production Manager Susie Brown. The company still uses machines built in the 1970s in its production lines.\\n\\nGoogle Launches Native Ads In Gmail To All Advertisers:\\xa0Google is rolling out a new ad format in Gmail to all advertisers today. A few years ago, Google launched a new kind of native ad in Gmail that sat at the top of the inbox and mostly looked like a regular email. For the most part, that was a pretty unobtrusive way of displaying ads (though some people were rather annoyed by them). Starting today, Google is making it easier for all advertisers to buy these ads. Advertisers can now buy these new Gmail ads directly from AdWords. For Gmail users, these ads will work very differently from the type of ads Google first introduced for Gmail and they will appear both in the mobile versions of Gmail and on the web. The native ads are collapsed by default and will expand to full-page native ads when you click on them. Google says the idea here is to “recreate the informational and visual richness of a landing page.” It looks like Google will charge advertisers every time a user expands one of these ad units (and all subsequent clicks from there are then free). What’s interesting is that these ads are made for forwarding, too, with a “forward” and “Save to Inbox” link underneath all of them. When you click on “Save to Inbox,” the ad will move into your inbox and you can then treat it just like any other regular email.\\n\\nWhy Lyft Should Go Public Before Uber:\\xa0It’s no secret that Lyft is far smaller than Uber. It’s in 65 cities in the U.S. compared to Uber’s 60 countries around the world. A 2014 study done by financial firm FutureAdvisor, which analyzed U.S. credit and debit card transactions, said that Uber’s American revenue was 12 times that of Lyft. Uber’s aggression has resulted in its American dominance; even its name has become common slang for “ride-share.” If Lyft was to go public before Uber, it would steal some of the black car company’s thunder. Consumer tech IPOs are regularly big marketing events. Given that few on-demand companies have gone public, the first IPO of a ride-hailing service would attract a lot of attention. By going public first, Lyft would also be able to grab early dollars, attracting investors that didn’t have the opportunity to access Uber’s big private funding rounds. Just like Uber injured Lyft’s private fundraising efforts by snapping up a huge array of potential investors for itself, Lyft could try a similar tactic with the public market. Not everyone will have the money or risk-taking appetite to back multiple ride-hailing companies. Lastly, a comparatively early IPO would give Lyft more money for its battle with Uber. At this point, the former has far less cash reserves — $1 billion — than the latter, which has more than $5 billion. Going public is primarily a way to raise a lot of money and fuel the business’s growth, and Lyft could use that. Despite the reasons it would make sense for Lyft to go public before Uber, its investors and advisers warned that they weren’t sure that was likely to happen. One said that since Lyft’s founders, John Zimmer and Logan Green, were “conservative” in their endeavors they might not take the risk of paving the ride-hailing IPO way. Another said that the company wouldn’t want to preempt a public offering if its finances and growth numbers weren’t strong enough for the quarterly scrutiny of the market (see Twitter as an example of why an early IPO doesn’t always end well).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple and Cisco Team Up on iPhone and iPad Sales:\\xa0Apple Inc. is teaming up with Cisco Systems Inc. to make its mobile devices work better with corporate networks using Cisco’s equipment, part of a push by Apple to expand sales to business customers. The partnership, announced on Monday by Cisco Executive Chairman John Chambers and Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook at Cisco’s annual sales meeting in Las Vegas, will make it easier to use iPhones and iPads together with Cisco’s products, including videoconferencing systems and the WebEx online meeting service. Last year, Apple and International Business Machines Corp. set aside a three-decade-old rivalry to create business software for iPhone and iPad users, seeking to cater to an increasingly mobile workforce. While Apple is pursuing a bigger slice of the market for corporate users of smartphones and tablets, IBM and Cisco are looking for opportunities in the mobile-computing boom. Engineers from both companies have been working together for 10 months, and Cisco and Apple salespeople will go on joint sales calls, he said. For example, iPhone users could click on a calendar appointment, and immediately start a videoconference or Cisco’s Spark chat application, instead of having to pull up each separately. IPhone users’ personal contacts can be integrated with directories on their desk phones. And since workers are increasingly mobile, calls from work colleagues would automatically ring on both the desk phone and iPhone.Apple and Cisco are also working on behind-the-scenes networking enhancements. Using a feature called Fast Lane, a videoconference that’s critical to closing a deal can be given more bandwidth priority over YouTube video streams to desktops. Cisco is also developing ways to help companies prevent network slowdowns when Apple releases updates to its iOS software, by storing parts of Apple’s software code so that iPhone owners on Cisco networks won’t have to download it from a far-off data centers.\\n\\nIndia’s Antitrust Commission Accuses Google Of Rigging Its Search Results:\\xa0Less than a week after it responded to anti-competition claims laid down by the EU, Google is under-fire once again for its business practices. This time in India. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has charged the U.S. company with rigging search results to benefit its many businesses, as The Economic Times reports. Google copped a $166,000 fine last year for failing to cooperate with this probe, but this time around, the worst case scenario could see it fined up to 10 percent of its revenue — the company posted a net income of $14 billion on $66 billion in revenue for 2014 — according to reports. TechCrunch understands that the CCI’s document is over 600 pages in length, although the chief concerns center around how Google positions and uses its own services with its search engine. Like the initial European investigation, Indian authorities appear to believe that its search engine is favoring the company’s maps service, travel sites, and advertising products, at the expense of competitors and those that use its advertising services. As part of its probe, the CCI sought out industry opinions on Google’s position. Economic Times reported that a bevy of high-profile technology companies — including Flipkart, Facebook, and Nokia — corroborated the complaint, which was initially filed by matrimony service Bharat, nonprofit Consumer Unity and Trust Society. TechCrunch understands from sources, though, that it wasn’t all one-way traffic. Other companies had voiced no complaint in response to the various accusations levied against Google, and those include Times Internet, Make My Trip, Group M, and Rediff.\\n\\nU.S. developing sanctions against China over cyberthefts:\\xa0The Obama administration is developing a package of unprecedented economic sanctions against Chinese companies and individuals who have benefited from their government’s cybertheft of valuable U.S. trade secrets. The U.S. government has not yet decided whether to issue these sanctions, but a final call is expected soon — perhaps even within the next two weeks, according to several administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Issuing sanctions would represent a significant expansion in the administration’s public response to the rising wave of \\xadcyber-economic espionage initiated by Chinese hackers, who officials say have stolen everything from nuclear power plant designs to search engine source code to confidential negotiating positions of energy companies. Any action would also come at a particularly sensitive moment between the world’s two biggest economies. President Xi Jinping of China is due to arrive next month in Washington for his first state visit — complete with a 21-gun salute on the South Lawn of the White House and an elaborate State Dinner. There is already tension over a host of other issues, including maritime skirmishes in the South China Sea and China’s efforts to devalue its currency in the face of its recent stock market plunge. At the same time, the two countries have deep trade ties and the administration has sometimes been wary of seeming too tough on China.\\n\\nHotels Fight Back Against Sites Like Expedia and Priceline:\\xa0For years, travelers have been drawn to online sites like Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz and Priceline to find and reserve hotel rooms, flights and rental cars. Hotels welcomed the system — or at least learned to live with it — even though the business came at the cost of substantial commissions. But now they are fighting back. With the online giants consolidating and potentially tightening their hold on travel bookings, major hotel chains are offering a host of benefits to lure travelers to book with them directly: digital check-in, free meals, Wi-Fi and even the ability to choose a specific room. At the same time, the industry has been outspoken with regulators this year in an attempt to block a merger of two of the largest online booking companies, Expedia and Orbitz. Hilton has introduced a number of services for guests who book directly, including a digital check-in option that eliminates waiting in line. Quickly adopted by its customers, the app is now used by over one million people each month, according to Geraldine Calpin, who oversees Hilton’s worldwide digital efforts. Hilton also offers direct-booking guests the ability to choose their exact room, a feature similar to an airplane’s seat-map function. “The guest can see the plan of each floor and click on the room they want,” Ms. Calpin said. Loyalty programs also help steer consumers toward booking directly with hotels, with rewards points and “elite” level benefits like concierge lounges, free meals and upgrades. Some chains are also trying to beat online travel agencies at their own game. Marriott has arranged for some rooms to be booked directly through the travel review site TripAdvisor. TripAdvisor gets a commission, but only about half what Expedia would charge. Expedia has been on a takeover binge this year: In January, it snapped up Travelocity, for $280 million, and last year it acquired a popular Australian site, Wotif.com. Its proposed takeover of Orbitz would give the combined company control of roughly 75 percent of the entire domestic market for third-party online booking, according to the research firm Phocuswright, potentially giving it enormous leverage over the commissions that hotels pay for their listings.\\n\\nRussia’s Fist Just Clenched Around the Internet a Little Tighter:\\xa0Global Internet firms operating in Russia wake up on Tuesday to a new era in Kremlin regulation. A law now forces tech firms with Russian customers to operate local servers to handle Russian personal data. It’s the latest in a string of about 20 laws tightening government control of the Internet, all put into place since President Vladimir Putin’s re-election in 2012. Taken at face value the new program is aimed at protecting the privacy of Russian citizens. It’s not a uniquely Russian idea, and is something Brazil and Germany are also exploring in the post-Snowden era. Yet human rights activists fear the regulation will be misused, allowing officials to spy on citizens and suppress political activists. It comes into force days after Wikipedia was briefly blacklisted because of an article about cannabis. All eyes are now on Facebook, Google and Twitter, which have been meeting with the Kremlin in private to make sense of the law. At this stage it’s not clear whether they will agree to comply.\\n\\nVenture capital cash surfers may see waves recede in market turmoil:\\xa0The waves of cash surfed relentlessly by some of Silicon Valley\\'s largest venture-backed businesses are showing signs of receding amid concern the companies may already be worth more than their likely valuations once they finally go public. Investors have created 132 privately held companies valued at $1 billion or more each, according to tracker firm CB Insights, including ride-hailing service Uber [UBER.UL], accommodation service Airbnb and messaging app Snapchat. After a turbulent week for equities, prompted by worries about the faltering Chinese economy, it may take longer for companies aiming to join their ranks to raise multimillion-dollar funding rounds, and they may not get the investment terms they want. \"Many companies in the market for funding right now are struggling to meet their valuation expectations and are going to have to reassess,\" said Jon Sakoda of venture firm NEA. \"Investors are now being much more selective identifying which companies can succeed under the scrutiny of the public markets,\" said Roger Lee, an investing partner with Battery Ventures. One indicator could be GSV Capital, a Nasdaq-traded fund that buys shares of private companies from early employees and others. The fund, which as of June 30 held 12.5 percent of its assets in data-analysis company Palantir and 7.7 percent in storage company Dropbox, has dropped 6 percent since Aug. 20. One late-stage venture investor said that five to six startups he declined to fund last quarter - because of what he considered pricey terms - came back willing to re-enter negotiations after being turned down elsewhere.\\n\\n\\n')\n",

Earlier this month, personal information about millions of Ashley Madison customers, including e-mails, member profiles, credit-card transactions and other sensitive information, showed up online. A group known as Impact Team took credit for the hack, which is now under investigation by the FBI and Canadian authorities.The information was initially only accessible on the dark Web, where users must use anonymous browsing tools. But soon after the hack, databases showed up on the broader Web allowing people to search some parts of the data. Analysis of that data seemed to suggest that most of the female profiles on the site were fake. Those millions of Ashley Madison men were paying to hook up with women who appeared to have created profiles and then simply disappeared. Were they cobbled together by bots and bored admins, or just user debris? Whatever the answer, the more I examined those 5.5 million female profiles, the more obvious it became that none of them had ever talked to men on the site, or even used the site at all after creating a profile. Actually, scratch that. As I’ll explain below, there’s a good chance that about 12,000 of the profiles out of millions belonged to actual, real women who were active users of Ashley Madison. When you look at the evidence, it’s hard to deny that the overwhelming majority of men using Ashley Madison weren’t having affairs. They were paying for a fantasy.\\n\\nUber hires two security researchers who hacked a moving Jeep to improve car technology:\\xa0Uber has hired two top vehicle security researchers, the company said on Friday, high-profile additions that come as the ride-hailing service ramps up its work on technology for self-driving cars. Charlie Miller, who had been working at Twitter Inc, and Chris Valasek, who worked at security firm IOActive, have resigned from their jobs and will join Uber next week. Miller and Valasek won wide attention this month after demonstrating that they could hack into a moving Jeep. Uber on Tuesday announced a partnership with the University of Arizona, offering the school grant money to fund research into the mapping and safety technology needed for autonomous vehicles, which Uber will test on the streets of Tucson, Arizona. This partnership follows the more tumultuous effort earlier this year at Carnegie Mellon University that resulted in Uber hiring away more than 40 of its top scientists and researchers, leaving one of the world\\'s top robotics research institutions reeling.\\n\\nJet.com CEO: We May Have the Lowest Prices, but Many Shoppers Can’t Figure That Out:\\xa0Jet.com may have the lowest prices on the Web, but a lot of people who visit the site still don’t realize it. That is something CEO Marc Lore acknowledged when asked about confusion among people who hear about Jet.com’s low prices but don’t see them displayed clearly when they visit a Jet.com product page. “Believe me, we have this discussion every single day,” Lore said in an interview Thursday evening. “We keep tweaking the [user experience] to make it more clear and are bringing in research groups. But you’re right, it’s still frustrating to [some].” Before we get to the confusion, a reminder about how Jet works: Jet marks down most of the products it sells below the lowest price elsewhere on the Web. How? The retailers that sell goods through Jet give Jet a fee for each sale, but Jet doesn’t pocket that fee, as competing online marketplaces do. Instead, it gives a large portion of it back to shoppers in the form of discounts on each item they buy. Lore has said the company will simply break even on the actual sale of goods, and then generate a profit through the $50 membership fee Jet shoppers have to pay each year. Many smart people in the industry are skeptical that Jet can become big enough to make this model work.The confusion among potential shoppers stems from how Jet displays these discounted prices. Lore said the reason it doesn’t show the fully discounted price is straightforward: Some of the product brands that sell on Jet have asked Jet not to display the discounted price because it is angering other retailers they sell their products to. Lore didn’t name these brands, but said the company wanted to do good by them even if it led to some short-term confusion among shoppers. For now, Jet has opted for a uniform design strategy even though it has only heard complaints from some of the brands they sell. That said, Jet is considering making a change so that the fully discounted price will be shown for brands that don’t object and leave the pricing display as is for the brands that do, Lore said.\\n\\nIs the Tech Market Hitting Middle Age?:\\xa0First it was PCs. Now it’s tablets. And very soon, it will be smartphones. Each of these markets has — or will — hit its peak in both revenue and unit shipments in short order. Each has moved (or will soon move) from the soaring grandeur of youth and young adulthood to the dowdiness of mature middle age. As these inevitable market developments occur, important shifts are starting to happen. Not only will device manufacturers and their key component suppliers have to evolve their businesses — as many have started to do — but very soon, so will companies offering software and services used by those devices. While some argue that these software and services companies are taking over the world, it’s naive to think that their growth can be maintained completely independent of the devices. At a fundamental level, the two are linked, and when the device numbers peak, so too do the potential users of any software or service. Admittedly, there’s more of a growth opportunity over the short term for these software and service companies, but that won’t last forever, either. As with any major industry transformation, this means that some of the biggest industry players may not survive in their current form (or at all), while others are likely to go through some dramatic transformations. This also means that there will be tremendous opportunities for today’s smaller or even yet-to-be started companies. The tech industry’s transition to a more mature market does bring with it the opportunity for some potentially boring baggage when it comes to things like stagnant unit-growth rates. However, instead of viewing this as a midlife crisis, smart, innovative companies will figure out ways to see these developments as a midlife celebration that can open up new opportunities.\\n\\nYour First 10 Customers Can Make Or Break You:\\xa0Early in a startup’s life, the main focus is building the right product for the right market. For most B2B startups, this is the period when you start winning your first 10 customers. These 10 customers are unlike any others you’ll have over the course of your company. You’ll sell to them differently, charge them differently and try to get different things out of the relationship than you will from those that follow. This is the group that will teach you how to refine your product, whether or not you are targeting a large enough market and how to craft a scalable sales process that will help you land your next 100 customers. You’re The First Head Of Sales. It will be tempting to hire an experienced sales veteran when you’re busy trying to get the product right and grow the company, but there is a strong argument against that. The first 10 customers should be sold by you, the CEO or founder. Look For Young And Ambitious Customers. While it’s admirable to target big-name customers, the chances are unlikely that they’ll take a meeting or make a bet on a brand new product. Similarly, a potential customer who is far along or at the end of his career may not have a high tolerance for risk or change. Focus On Engagement, Not Revenue. As you land more customers and add them to your client roster, it is essential that each initial customer uses your product at the engagement level to be considered an active user. Engagement levels — not revenue numbers — are often a stronger indication of long-term product adoption. This should be your top priority. Your first set of customers will inevitably serve as reference accounts — and the more engaged users are, the better references they’ll provide. Know Who To “Sign” And When To Walk Away. Focus your initial sales efforts on prospects who aren’t your friends. To be scalable, your product will need validation outside of your network, and you need the type of honest feedback that friends don’t often provide.\\n\\nIZettle, a Swedish Payments Start-Up, Begins a Lending Program:\\xa0Jacob de Geer, who is a Swedish entrepreneur and the co-founder of iZettle, a payments service that offers merchants a device for processing credit card transactions, says banks don’t meet the needs of many small businesses. “Financial institutions focus more on their large clients than on the small ones,” he said. “Most of them were founded way before the invention of the Internet or the smartphone.” But he thinks he has a solution. On Friday, iZettle announced a program to lend money to small businesses that use its service, providing cash advances to companies for a one-time fee. IZettle, which operates in 11 countries from Britain to Brazil, raised a further $67 million from its existing backers, including Intel Capital and American Express, to take its total fund-raising to roughly $180 million. The steps by iZettle follow similar announcements from Square, the six-year-old American payments start-up, that also has expanded from its payments roots to offer additional financial products for its small-business customers. Square also offers a device to process credit card transactions. For iZettle, the new lending program will initially be available only in Europe, and the company will charge small businesses a flat fee ?equivalent to roughly 10 to 15 percent ?of each cash advance. To recoup the money it lends to businesses, the start-up will take a small percentage of each transaction that small businesses process through its payments system. To reduce defaults, the company says it will crunch data from businesses’ existing transactions to determine their credit risk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber China closes $1 billion fundraising round at $7 billion valuation: sources:\\xa0Uber’s China arm has closed its $1 billion fundraising round early, according to two people with knowledge of the matter, with investors still hopeful for the U.S.-based ride service despite strong domestic competition in the car-hailing market. The deal was oversubscribed, said the second source directly familiar with the fundraising. According to a fundraising document seen by Reuters last week, this round values Uber China at $7 billion, with the unit planning to list on the mainland by 2020.\\n\\nOne Billion People Log In to Facebook for First Time:\\xa0For the first time, a billion people used Facebook in a single day on Monday. Facebook’s chief, Mark Zuckerberg, observed the occasion with a post on his Facebook page, saying that one out of seven people on Earth logged in to the social network to connect with their friends and family. The one billion figure is different from the daily user numbers Facebook discloses each quarter when it reports its financial results. Those are the average number of daily users, counted over a 30-day period. Facebook had 968 million daily active users in June. Most people on Facebook live outside the United States and Canada.\\n\\nYouTube gets super serious about gaming videos:\\xa0Enter player two: YouTube stepped into the world of game-streaming Wednesday with the official launch of YouTube Gaming -- its answer to Amazon\\'s popular gaming site, Twitch. The new section of YouTube allows gaming companies and everyday gamers to share live or recorded videos about the games of the moment. It also gives YouTube an official home for video game content as the business of watching other people play video games continues to gain popularity. Google first announced it would launch YouTube Gaming early this summer, ahead of the industry\\'s big Electronic Entertainment Expo trade show, known more widely as E3. The debut comes a year after Google lost a bidding war with Amazon to buy Twitch, the Web\\'s current leader in video game streaming. Amazon bought Twitch last August for nearly $1 billion dollars. Twitch is Google\\'s main competition here. But YouTube isn\\'t starting from scratch: it already has a huge amount of gaming content across its site. The company boasts \"billions\" of views across its site and says that time its users spend with gaming videos is up 75 percent in the past year. ZEFR, a technology firm that crunches YouTube data, estimates that videos of the walkthrough genre of what is known as \"Let\\'s Play\" has garnered 40 billion views in the lifetime of YouTube.\\n\\nShazura: A More Efficient Way to Search Images:\\xa0While most image-search software finds photos using keywords or phrases, Shazura’s binary system behaves more like the human brain, visually matching images that look the same with greater speed and efficiency. Pérez de la Coba, an electrical engineer by training, began coding Shazura in 2011 out of frustration. She’d snapped a photo of a pair of shoes she wanted but had trouble finding them online with existing image-comparison services such as Google’s. Upload a file, outline what you want to search for, and Shazura’s algorithm converts the image to a lengthy “numeric signature” containing extensive descriptive information. The number for a willow, say, is distinct from that for a cypress, or a green bag from a blue one. By cutting out the intermediary translation steps, Shazura sifts through a customer’s image database more quickly and accurately and uses less computing power than traditional search engines. Without having to rely on keyword tags or extensive if-then instructions, Shazura can make large-scale image searches much easier for government agencies, advertisers, or social networks, says Pérez de la Coba. Shazura has raised $1.2 million from investors and so far the 10-employee company has licensed its technology to clothiers El Corte Inglés and RichRelevance.\\n\\nFacebook\\'s Instagram adds new photo sizes to keep users, attract ads:\\xa0Instagram has added new layout options in addition to its signature square for pictures and videos in a bid to attract more advertisers and to stop users defecting to more flexible services such as Snapchat. The move is the first major alteration to the photo-sharing, social media service since Facebook Inc bought it for $1 billion in 2012, and addresses the wishes of many of its 300 million users, who have been constrained by the square format. One in five photos and videos posted on the service do not fit the square format, Instagram said in a blog post. \"Friends get cut out of group shots, the subject of your video feels cramped and you can’t capture the Golden Gate Bridge from end to end,\" it said. From Thursday, Instagram\\'s web-based service and its mobile apps running on Google Inc\\'s Android system and Apple Inc\\'s iOS will allow portrait and landscape formats, giving both users and paying advertisers more options. The move should help Instagram in its battle with newer rivals such as Snapchat for users in the fast-moving messaging and media-sharing market. At the same time, it should attract more advertising revenue for Instagram, which said in June it would open its platform to all advertisers by the end of the year, rather than just to select brands. Instagram is expected to generate nearly $600 million in advertising revenue by the end of this year and $2.8 billion in 2017, according to projections from research firm eMarketer.\\n\\nApple is closing in on Fitbit:\\xa0Apple, which launched the Apple Watch in June, is within striking distance of leader Fitbit Inc in the wearable devices market, market research firm IDC said. Apple shipped 3.6 million Apple Watches in the second quarter of 2015, just behind Fitbit\\'s 4.4 million wearable fitness and health trackers, IDC said. The Apple Watch, which sports many health-related features and apps, is seen as the biggest rival to Fitbit\\'s trackers. Shipments of wearable devices more than tripled to 18.1 million units in the second quarter, IDC said. \"It\\'s worth noting that Fitbit only sells basic wearables - a category that is expected to lose share over the next few years, leaving Apple poised to become the next market leader for all wearables,\" the IDC report said. Fitbit Inc\\'s stock market listing in June got a rousing response from investors, with shares jumping as much as 60 percent. They closed at $38.40 on Wednesday, nearly double their IPO price.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook Goes Nuclear On The Messaging War With Its M Assistant:\\xa0All messaging apps are the same no more. A few years ago, there were few differences between SMS and a slew of chat apps like WhatsApp, WeChat, Kik, Line, KakaoTalk and Facebook Messenger. But each have slowly defined themselves differently, whether through simplicity, connections to businesses, media, stickers, games, location, and other features. But today, Facebook escalated the battle for chat with the official announcement of M, its new personal assistant built into Messenger. It can actually complete tasks for you, such as buy things, deliver gifts, make reservations, arrange travel, or just about anything else you ask of it. What’s truly unique, though, is what’s behind M. Specifically, a lot of live bodies. M isn’t just artificial intelligence. Facebook has contracted real people to help M answer people’s requests while teaching the technology how to handle them automatically in the future. M is still in early beta testing, so it’s hard to assess just how well it accomplishes this grand ambition. But if it works, Facebook may have developed a product so useful yet so complex and resource-intensive that it could differentiate Facebook Messenger in a way its competitors can’t or won’t follow. There are digital assistants like Google Now and Siri. But those are so mechanized that they can only provide rote answers and reminders. There are personal assistants like Magic and Operator that use humans to answer complex requests, but they’re independent apps without massive scale. And there are messaging apps fighting to grow their already-huge audiences, but that still look similar despite their attempts to differentiate.\\n\\nGoogle Now’s Staff Exodus Reveals Hurdles for New CEO Pichai:\\xa0On Thursday, Microsoft fired up an old rivalry. The Redmond giant released an update to its Bing search app that allows other apps to tap into its information architecture. See something in one mobile app — a nice location shot in Instagram, say — and, with a tap, you can summon information about that something via Bing. Nothing earth-shattering. But Microsoft happened to put out the release on Android first, and did so right before Google is set to launch Now on Tap, a nearly identical feature. Google teased the product with some fanfare in May, at its I/O developer conference, as a breakthrough iteration of Google Now, its personal assistant and one of the twin bedrocks for CEO Larry Page when he returned as executive in 2011. What went unannounced was that most of the original team that built Now had departed, many of them just before I/O, according to multiple sources. Some had grown frustrated that the product, born within Android, was shuttered into search inside of Google, they said. And Sundar Pichai, Google’s SVP and incoming CEO, did not prioritize the product as much as Page. The exits reveal the hiccups Google has incubating new products that reach across multiple units of the tech giant. They also expose some key traits of Pichai’s leadership style — and some of the many hurdles he has ahead as he marshals Google’s core business. At some point last year Amit Singhal, the SVP who heads search, requested that Now move from Android into his division, multiple sources said. Several engineers objected. According to multiple sources, their initial vision of Now — as a mobile assistant tailored to particular users — works best living on the mobile operating system, not within search. Also, Google is a political place and search is Congress. Big, necessary, stodgy. Pichai approved Singhal’s request. In part, perhaps, because Google must balance products like Now, which push information to users, with its central business problem: It makes less money from mobile searches. Google has started to deploy Now as a primary vehicle for indexing apps. Two of the engineers who created Now left the company in March; several others left around the same time. Only one of the founding team remains at Google, according to multiple sources. (Google, again, declined to comment on this.) For several, the experience of seeing their product steered in an unwanted direction was too dispiriting, they said. “Google’s a big company,” said one person who departed. “This is how big companies work.”\\n\\nAmazon to launch video streaming service in Japan:\\xa0Amazon.com said on Wednesday it plans to launch its video streaming service in Japan for members of its Prime paid service as it gears up for Netflix Inc\\'s planned entry into the country in September. Amazon\\'s Prime members get unlimited access to videos under its Prime Instant Video service. Prime membership, which costs 3,900 yen ($32.50) a year in Japan, provides members other services such as the option to choose a delivery date for online purchases for free. Amazon plans to offer a broad video lineup including U.S. and Japanese films, TV shows and cartoons in Japan.\\n\\nIn-Flight Wi-Fi Prices Jump as Demand Surges:\\xa0Many travelers are experiencing sticker shock from in-flight Wi-Fi these days. While there are several in-flight Wi-Fi providers, including ViaSat and Global Eagle Entertainment, Gogo is the top provider, equipping more than 2,000 planes from airlines like American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Virgin America with its service, up from 1,300 in 2011. Gogo’s prices often change depending on when and where you are flying. But on some flights — especially transcontinental routes crammed with business travelers who may have cushy expense accounts — prices have doubled from three years ago. Gogo’s prices are not just higher now; they are also more unpredictable. The company uses a method called dynamic pricing, in which it tries to forecast the demand for Wi-Fi on each flight and scale pricing accordingly. So the prices for the full durations of transcontinental flights also change each day: Gogo charges the most, $40, on Mondays and Thursdays; Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays cost $34; and Saturdays are the cheapest, at $28. Driving the uneven prices on certain routes is Gogo’s reliance on higher fees to ease overcrowding of its network. With passengers packing a growing number of Internet-connected electronics like smartphones, gaming devices and tablets in their carry-on luggage, the amount of bandwidth they consume on popular flights keeps expanding. Consumers can take heart because there are several ways to pay less for in-flight Wi-Fi. If Internet in the sky is that important, you can always pick an airline offering cheaper Wi-Fi, like Southwest or JetBlue. Or if you’re flying on a Gogo-equipped airplane, you can choose a day of the week when Wi-Fi prices are lower. Another way to get a cheaper rate for Gogo is o rdering the service before boarding the plane. People can buy an all-day pass to use Wi-Fi on any Gogo-equipped flight for $16, while frequent travelers can purchase a monthly subscription for $50.\\n\\nBack-to-School Apps for the Organized Student:\\xa0Among the apps worth considering is gFlash+, which takes flashcards to a whole new level. You can create digital cards and write facts that you need to remember on them (“e to the power of i times pi is 1,” or some such). Use those cards to quiz yourself. You can embed photos, audio files or videos, or all three, into flashcards to make them more visual and interactive. Users can share their flashcard sets with others through email, so a whole study group could benefit. The core app, which allows users to create unlimited card sets, is free on iOS and Android. The pro version, which costs $4, gets rid of ads and includes organizing features and more. You can also pay to get access to card sets from third-party publishers, including big names in education like McGraw-Hill. StudyBlue is an alternative flashcard app with many of the same features, including quizzes and card sharing, but a cleaner, more minimalistic look. Users can see millions of flashcards created and shared by other students and teachers. To use most of the app’s features, StudyBlue users need to create a free account on iOS and Android. Upgrading to the pro edition gives users access to extras like the ability to customize the formatof your flashcards. StudyBlue’s pro level is somewhat pricey at $18 a month or $80 a year. Note-taking is a vital part of student life, which is one reason to check out the Notability app. Notability, $6 for iPhones and iPads, lets users sketch on their screens, take handwritten notes or type notes. Typed notes don’t have to be in a linear document style — text boxes can be added anywhere on the page. Students can also annotate source material that is in PDF form directly from the app. And the app lets users make audio recordings of lectures or discussions so they can review a lesson later. Notability also remembers the order in which you made your sketches and notes, and shows them at the appropriate points when you play the audio back. The app integrates with cloud services like Dropbox and iCloud and social media platforms like Twitter, making it easier to share notes with classmates. On Android, Papyrus is a great alternative to Notability, providing many of the same functions. Users can take handwritten notes, make sketches using drawing tools, type in text and annotate images.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba CEO Urges Workers to Ignore Share Plunge, Keep Focus:\\xa0Alibaba’s chief executive officer exhorted employees Tuesday to ignore plunging stock markets after the e-commerce giant’s shares fell below their initial public offering price for the first time. Daniel Zhang, who took the helm of Asia’s largest Internet company three months ago, wrote a memo urging his 35,000 workers to brush aside the market turmoil. Alibaba has lost about $128 billion in market value since its November peak amid a slowing Chinese economy. “This is not the first time that the global stock market has plunged,” Zhang wrote in the e-mail. “It is not the last time, either. I hope everyone can shift the focus from the stock market to customers.” Alibaba fell 3.5 percent Monday to close at $65.80 in New York, dropping below its September IPO price of $68 as a global market rout revived investors’ concerns about the company’s sales growth. The company’s shares rose 4.2 percent to $68.57 at Tuesday’s close in New York, outlasting a rally in U.S. stocks that evaporated in the final hour of trading. “Let’s forget about the stock prices,” Zhang wrote. “We should not be distracted by short-term obstacles, but plan for the future and stick to it.” The Hangzhou-based company’s shares peaked at $119.15 in November, with investors eager to reach Alibaba’s more than 300 million customers. Their subsequent decline has been fueled by concerns about the decelerating Chinese economy, increased competition from JD.com Inc. and government reports that Alibaba wasn’t doing enough to weed out counterfeit goods on its site.\\n\\nAmazon expands Prime Now, offers U.S. alcohol for first time:\\xa0Amazon.com said on Tuesday it will begin delivering wine, beer and spirits to U.S. customers for the first time as part of its speedy delivery service, Prime Now. The online retailer is expanding Prime Now, its one- and two-hour service, to Seattle, where the company is headquartered, and offering alcohol deliveries there. Amazon Prime, the company\\'s $99 per year shopping membership program, offers free two-day delivery on millions of items. It is a key testing ground for the retailer\\'s new services, ranging from TV and on-demand video to fast delivery. Amazon has said it has \"tens of millions\" of Prime subscribers. Analysts estimate the program to have around 40 million users worldwide. The company has steadily expanded Prime Now since it launched the service in New York City last year. It facilitates integration of the retailer\\'s grocery delivery service, Amazon Fresh, which has been slower to expand to new markets. On-demand grocery delivery is a growing and competitive market in the United States. Instacart, a grocery delivery company, announced on Tuesday that it had expanded to Indianapolis, its 17th city. Other startups, like Postmates, which focuses on meal delivery, also deliver personal care goods and alcohol for customers using a network of couriers.\\n\\nGmail To Auto-Populate Google Calendar With Things Like Flights, Hotel Bookings And Ticket Details:\\xa0Google announced today that it’s starting to roll out features that will place ticket, flight, hotel and restaurant info onto Google Calendar. Automatically. For example, if you buy a flight, rent a car, book a hotel and set reservations for the day you get into town for business, all of those items will be added to your Calendar if the exact time for those events are available. Your flight would show up at 4, reservation at 9, etc.\\n\\nHulu Teams With Facebook\\'s LiveRail and Oracle to Sell Ads This Fall Tests programmatic advertising waters:\\xa0The streaming-video service, owned by Fox, NBCUniversal and Disney, is partnering with Oracle Data Management Platform and Facebook-owned video-ad platform LiveRail to offer programmatic advertising options—automating the buying, placement and optimization of ads—for the first time. The rollout will happen this fall and won\\'t be specifically tied to any of Hulu\\'s major fall premieres. The Oracle DMP will combine first-party and third-party data, which Hulu says will help it increase reach, scale and efficiency for marketers as they personalize their Hulu campaigns. And LiveRail\\'s Video Private Exchange will allow Hulu to complete direct deals with advertisers programmatically. The news comes as Hulu is also prepping an ad-free option, which would reportedly launch this fall and be priced between $12 and $14 per month. That would be at least $4 more than Hulu\\'s current $7.99 monthly subscription free, which includes ads but fewer of them than Hulu\\'s free version. Hulu still isn\\'t commenting on its ad-free plans. While advertisers undoubtedly won\\'t like being shut out of Hulu\\'s priciest tier, the streaming service hopes its new programmatic offering will help them get the biggest bang for their buck.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA Plunge in China Rattles Markets Across the Globe:\\xa0Concerns about China’s ability to be a powerful engine of global economic growth have added to worries about the potential impact of higher interest rates in the United States, driving stocks sharply lower in Asia and Europe on Monday. When trading opened in New York, the major market measures went into what was essentially a free fall. While the steepest losses ended within minutes, share prices spent the rest of the day sharply rising and reversing course multiple times. When the day’s roller-coaster ride ended, the benchmark for stocks, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, was down 3.9 percent. That left the index off 11 percent from its May high, in what in market parlance is called a “correction,” its first since 2011. On Monday, the Shanghai composite index closed down 8.7 percent. In Europe, benchmark indexes in Germany, Britain and France fell nearly 5 percent or more. A number of emerging markets were also lower, with leading indexes in Brazil and Indonesia both down around 4 percent. In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted 1,000 points before regaining ground. Major US indices recovered some ground but still ended the day down over 3.5% each. The Treasury market was a beneficiary of the fear in stocks. The demand for bonds pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to as low as 1.90 percent before it settled at 2.01 percent. The recent market tumult began two weeks ago when the Chinese government unexpectedly allowed the value of its currency to drop, partly in response to indications that the country’s economy is weakening. The Chinese moves played into the continuing drop in the price of oil, which has taken the price of a barrel of crude oil down 65 percent over the last year. On Monday, the price of oil, as measured by a benchmark New York contract, dropped below $40. The selling in China has accelerated despite extraordinary government intervention in the last two months aimed at propping up share prices. On Sunday, the Chinese government said that the country’s pension funds would be allowed to invest in stocks for the first time. But the slide on Monday highlighted that the new policy, and several similar recent moves, have not been successful. Many investors are now hoping that the central bank, the People’s Bank of China, will cut the ratio of deposits that banks are required to keep on reserve in a bid to encourage lending and spur economic growth.\\n\\nHow the stock selloff could kill off some tech unicorns:\\xa0With so much uncertainty and market volatility, Silicon Valley firms could postpone initial public offerings, cooling a white-hot market for venture funding that has fueled the most lucrative environment for startups in history. Already, executives at RainDance Technologies, a firm that makes genomic tools to detect cancer and other diseases, announced Monday they have pulled their plan to go public, according to Reuters. And the big question is what will happen to the hundreds of startups -- a record 131 are valued at more than $1 billion -- that are now all dressed up for IPOs but with no place to go. \"Tech stocks have been getting crushed the past 6 weeks. Many names are down 25-50% from their highs. Today was very tough,\" Gurley wrote in a tweet last week. \"One might reasonably assume that this would have an adverse impact on late stage private market liquidity and valuation. I certainly do. If so, we may be nearing the end of a cycle where growth is valued more than profitability. It could be at an inflection point.\" Known as \"unicorns,\" the venture-funded firms with valuations of more than $1 billion have exploded in number to 131 companies valued at a total of $485 billion, according to venture capital research firm CB Insights. The sheer quantity of unicorns has for months caused concern of a startup-bubble, with investors racing to put money into bleeding edge innovators and their many imitators, when logically not all will thrive or even survive.\\n\\nVisa says its users more likely to complete online purchases than those using PayPal:\\xa0Visa said on Monday online shoppers using its payment service are 17 percentage points more likely to complete their purchases than those using PayPal. Visa Checkout, which allows shoppers to store their payment information without having to re-enter it every time they make a purchase online, said 66 percent of its enrolled customers completed their transactions after putting items in their shopping cart compared to 49 percent of PayPal\\'s Express Checkout customers. The data was collated for Visa by retail analytics firm ComScore. PayPal\\'s online payment service offers a similar convenience by allowing customers to log into their accounts on a merchant\\'s website. Paypal has not seen this report yet, said Anuj Nayar, senior director of platform, merchant and next gen commerce engagement. Nayar said in addition to PayPal Express Checkout the company has launched a new online payment service called PayPal One Touch, which makes using PayPal faster on any device with a single touch. \"Initial reports indicate that One Touch radically improves checkout conversion for merchants and time to checkout for consumers beyond anything else available in the market today,\" he said. Retailers and payment industry experts have often blamed the high rates of unfinished online transactions, after shoppers add items to their shopping carts, on the tiring process of re-entering payment information every time one makes a purchase. \"What has become more and more pronounced is as the size of the screen gets smaller, whether it\\'s a tablet, mobile or a watch, the less likely it becomes a consumer will finish his purchase,\" Sam Shrauger, senior vice president of Visa\\'s digital solutions, told Reuters.\\n\\nJabong biggest loss-maker among top Rocket Internet ventures:\\xa0Rocket Internet-incubated Indian fashion and lifestyle venture Jabong has become the top money losing initiative for the German emerging markets and Europe focused internet company. Jabong’s operating loss margin rose far ahead of Southeast Asian lifestyle e-commerce firm Lazada and Latin American e-commerce marketplace Linio in the first quarter of 2015, making it the most operating loss making property among Rocket Internet’s top ventures. Jabong had EBITDA loss margin of (-) 56 per cent last year, an improvement from 2013 when it posted (-) 68.5 per cent. This possibly signals how the firm is trying to push its sales faster with more discounting. This could also possibly reflect net revenues are failing to keep pace with operating expenses. Last year, in the same quarter Lazada sported the biggest EBITDA (earnings before interest tax and depreciation and amortisation) loss margin with Jabong and Linio being neck to neck, as per data shared by Rocket Internet. Also the average selling price of third-party vendors appears to be around 15 per cent higher than that of what Jabong direct e-tails to the customers. The average transaction value (including what it sells directly and products sold by other merchants) in Q1 stood at Rs 1,690 compared with a tad over Rs 1,500 in Q1 2014 and for full calendar year 2014. In the same period, average basket value of products sold directly by Jabong has risen marginally to around Rs 1,423. Third party vendors now represent around one in three transactions on Jabong every day. Meanwhile, Jabong was valued at around $480 million as of last December in its last funding round, according to Rocket Internet’s annual report. This means the firm was valued at around Rs 3,050 crore or 2.3 times its GMV for the year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn Friday, US Stocks Fell Most in 4 Years as China Dread Sank Global Markets:\\xa0Turbulence in financial markets gathered momentum amid intensifying concern over slowing global growth, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average into a correction and giving other stock gauges their worst losses since 2011. Oil sank below $40 a barrel for the first time since 2009 and was set for its longest losing streak since 1986. More than $3.3 trillion has been erased from the value of global equities after China’s decision to devalue its currency spurred a wave of selling across emerging markets. The worries over slower economic growth come as a strong dollar and plunge in oil prices take a toll on corporate earnings at the same time the Federal Reserve is contemplating the first boost to interest rates since 2006. Investors are selling the biggest winners of 2015. Companies that have come to be known as the Fab Five -- Netflix, Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple --have seen $97 billion in market value erased over two days. Losses have pushed the Nasdaq 100 Index down 7 percent, the biggest two-day decline since 2008. Apple entered a bear market, dropping 20 percent from a February high.\\n\\nHewlett-Packard Bucks Market’s Plunge After Earnings Report:\\xa0Hewlett-Packard squeezed out a gain amid Friday’s market plunge after issuing an earnings report that kept negative surprises to a minimum.“For the first time in several quarters HP did not mention unexpected bad news,” Jim Suva, an analyst at Citigroup Inc., wrote in a note to investors advising they buy the stock. “Previous quarters HP reduced cash flows, stated higher separation costs, more unplanned restructuring and costs, etc. We now believe the bad news is over.” Hewlett-Packard’s shares rose less than 1 percent to close at $27.47 after advancing as much as 7.6 percent earlier in the day. The stock gave up most of the increase as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index tumbled 3.2 percent, marking the gauge’s worst day in almost four years. Hewlett-Packard sales declined across most divisions in the fiscal third quarter. PC shipments fell 9.5 percent in the second quarter, and companies are spending less on software and services.\\n\\nA small Canadian city tries to drag intersections into the 21st century:\\xa0Have you ever sat pointlessly at a red light? There’s no cross-traffic, but the traffic light is clueless, so you’re forced to wait. Miovision chief executive Kurtis McBride feels your pain. “I can’t count the number of times I’ve been sitting at a red light with no cars around me and just wondering, ‘Why am I stuck in this situation,’ ” McBride said. His Canadian start-up is bringing modern technology to an industry that is years behind. Smart intersections could learn the traffic patterns and adjust the length of red and green lights to optimize the flow of traffic. Sitting at a pointless red light would be a thing of the past. Miovision envisions full automated intersections that are powered by algorithms. One Canadian transportation agency is currently testing Miovision’s technology in seven intersections on major arteries in Cambridge, Canada. The Waterloo Region wasn’t ready to go all-in on automated intersections, but is trying the technology to learn of malfunctioning lights, and adjust the timing of its lights. Miovision, which is based near Waterloo, raised $30 million earlier this year from investors.\\n\\nApple Raises $1.6 Billion in Record Corporate Bond Deal:\\xa0Apple raised A$2.25 billion ($1.6 billion) with a debut Australian debt sale that’s the largest bond deal ever Down Under by a non-financial company. The iPhone maker sold A$1.15 billion of seven-year notes at a yield of 110 basis points more than swap rates and A$1.1 billion of four-year securities at a 65 basis point spread. Apple, which until November had only sold U.S. currency bonds, has since expanded its debt issuance to euros, yen, pounds and Swiss francs as well as Aussie dollars. The proceeds of Apple’s Kangaroo bond sale may be used to return capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends, sale managers said in an earlier statement announcing plans to do an Aussie transaction. The Cupertino, California-based company announced in April it was boosting its capital-return program by $70 billion through March 2017 and would be accessing both U.S. and international debt markets to help pay for it. All of the longer maturity notes from Apple will be fixed-rate securities, while at the shorter tenor they are set to issue a fixed-rate portion of A$400 million and a floating-rate tranche of A$700 million. Initial price guidance on the four-year debt was for a spread of about 70 basis points, while the price talk on the seven-year notes was a gap of about 115 basis points.\\n\\nMobile language apps help millions learn less, more often:\\xa0Smartphone apps that help people learn languages for free or nearly free, a few sentences at a time, are piling pressure on established education firms and setting the pace for how to make lessons more engaging. Phone and tablet-based mobile products from newcomers like Germany\\'s Babbel, Britain\\'s Memrise and U.S.-based Duolingo have overtaken names like Berlitz and computer self-learning pioneer Rosetta Stone in terms of audience, if not yet sales or teaching sophistication, market researchers say. Tens of millions of users are being drawn to the flexibility of practising vocabulary or conversation on the go, either as part of a serious course of study or simply a more productive alternative to casual video gaming. \"It is a matter of incremental convenience: smartphone apps offer a wide selection of content that is more easily accessible, anytime, anywhere,\" said Ed Cooke, founder of London-based Memrise, whose language apps are mostly free. \"Binge learners tend not to come back,\" he said. \"People who learn a little tend to come back more regularly.\"The best mobile apps use voice recognition, email reminders and insights from the psychology of mobile games and cognitive science to keep entry-level as well as advanced users coming back for a few minutes of practice each day. Under pressure from new competitors, Rosetta Stone, which popularized language self-learning with CD boxsets selling for$200, has been restructuring to focus more on business and school sales rather than consumers. To catch up in mobile, it bought LiveMocha, a free online learning site, and created Apple and Android phone apps that give away a bit of content for free in a bid to draw intermediate users to commit to longer courses. Virginia-based Rosetta\\'s share price has plunged 77 percent since its stock market flotation in 2009. Recently, it saw its second-quarter revenue fall 10 percent to $51.4 million, with sales at its consumer business dropping 26 percent.\\n\\nDropbox’s Wall Street Challenge:\\xa0Dropbox boasts a valuation in the $10 billion range. Last February the company hired a new CFO, which for many startups is a signal that their IPO moment is coming sooner rather than later. Nobody knows for sure of course, and Dropbox isn’t talking, but if the company does decide to move forward with a flotation, it could face several challenges in spite of its strong market presence. Dropbox could still have trouble persuading a doubtful Wall Street money machine, which has shown little love for cloud companies, that it can overcome several hurdles: For starters, it will need to convince them that the subscription business model with a different reporting methodology is viable. It must defend its hybrid consumer/enterprise approach — and perhaps face questions where it will concentrate its resources moving forward. Finally, the company with its core business in storage and file syncing has to find a way to overcome the commoditization of these services and the race to the bottom with some of the biggest names in the business.\\n\\nOne of Tech’s Best Investors Keeps Passing on Deals Because Valuations Are Too Damn High:\\xa0Jeremy Levine knows a good deal when he sees one. As a top venture capitalist at Bessemer Venture Partners, he has invested in Pinterest, LinkedIn, Yelp and Shopify well before they reached peak popularity and watched as the last three went public. But over the last 20 months, Levine has led just one new investment, which has yet to be announced. The reason for the pause? Valuations are still just too damn high, he says. “Prices — especially for late stage deals — have been extraordinarily high for a while now and demand flawless execution and a lot of luck,” Levine said in an email following an in-person meeting. “The former is extremely hard to achieve, and the latter is obviously outside anyone’s control. Therefore, I believe a lot of the private deals that have [been] getting done recently are providing very poor risk-adjusted-returns for investors.” “Perhaps the dramatic cool-off in the public markets over the last week will start to change things in the private markets,” he added.\\n\\nFarewell To Flash: What It Means For Digital Video Publishers:\\xa0It’s been more than five years since Steve Jobs wrote his infamous “Thoughts on Flash” letter citing the high level of energy consumption, lack of performance on mobile and poor security as the reasons his company’s products would not support Adobe Flash technology. Finally, it appears we’re getting closer to the curtain closing on Flash. Over the years, Flash has become famous for a few less-than flattering features that can all play a role in hindering user experience, including intrusive experiences, increasing page-load times, lowering a site’s search engine optimization (SEO) and security flaws. Despite all these grievances, the digital-video advertising industry has been forced to use Flash because of VPAID (Video Player-Ad Interface Definition), a standard that allows a video ad and a video player to communicate with each other. VPAID provides a way to dynamically swap or customize video-ad creative based on ad decisions, and has long been used for Flash-based video ads on desktops. When you consider the fact that Flash needs to be installed (as opposed to HTML5, which requires no installation), it’s easy to see why in the long term, it didn’t stand a chance. This means that if publishers don’t upgrade their format specification, some or all of their video content may no longer be available for people to view; this will certainly affect viewer loyalty and monetization efforts. For example, Flash video ads served in a desktop Chrome browser will load in a paused state, then the user will have to click the ad for it to play. These ads will still register as impressions. However, it won’t take long for programmatic buyers to scale back their bids on video ad inventory garnering a high number of impressions with no quartiles. Publishers need to urge their buyers to prepare for the upcoming Flash-pocalypse because, despite the publishers‘ level of preparation, if their buyers don’t have the proper HTML5 creative assets, it will impact their ability to transact, having an impact on publisher revenue and the ability to successfully implement advertiser campaigns. The most crucial thing for publishers is going to be ensuring that their advertisers and demand partners (ad networks, ad exchanges and advertisers) are providing and hosting HTML5 ad creatives moving forward. Publishers themselves will also need to migrate their tech stack. Not having a complete HTML5 advertising technology stack can potentially impact their ad revenue as buyer bids will eventually subside for non-compatible inventory.\\n\\nThe ‘Unicorn’ Club, Now Admitting New Members:\\xa0The $1 billion valuation metric was popularized two years ago by the venture investor Aileen Lee. She found that many of the start-ups that reaped the hugest riches for venture capital investors — Facebook and LinkedIn, for example — often reached a valuation of $1 billion or more while they were privately held. Because of their rarity, Ms. Lee called those companies “unicorns,” after the mythical creatures. Since then, numerous start-ups have attained the $1 billion distinction — and topped it. With investors rushing to bet on the next big thing, the ride-hailing service Uber received a valuation of around $51 billion, while Airbnb, the online room-rental service, is pegged at about $24 billion. And every month, more companies are jumping into the unicorn echelon. To find out which companies might be next to ascend, CB Insights, which tracks venture capital and start-ups, conducted an analysis for The New York Times. CB Insights used a proprietary software tool called Mosaic, which analyzes dozens of factors about a start-up, including the amount of money raised by a company, employee turnover, news and social media mentions, awards, customer growth and partnerships. It also examines the overall health of the industry in which the start-up competes, as well as what can be known about the quality of a company’s investors. CB Insights won a grant from the National Science Foundation to build Mosaic, using machine learning and data science to turn unstructured text into a quantitative tool to measure company health. The CB Insights analysis resulted in a list of 50 companies that cover the globe and span different tech sectors but speak to some of the trends from the current boom. Half of the companies on the list are based in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, the cradle of tech start-ups, but 10 are international, with several hailing from China and India. Ms. Lee, who coined the term unicorn, said there were more $1 billion private companies these days partly because big industries like hotels and taxis were now considered fair game for start-ups. The thing to watch, she said, is whether companies meet the expectations and goals they set when they became unicorns before they burn through the money they raised. “If they don’t do that, they’re in a dangerous position,” she said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter shares hit an all-time low:\\xa0Twitter stock dropped below its initial public offering price in intra-day trading Thursday as the company looks for a new chief executive. The social media titan has watched stocks slide for weeks after a disappointing earnings call with analysts last month that highlighted the company\\'s troubles with growth and focus. On the call, interim chief executive and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey said that the company would need time to hit \"mass market\" growth — a message that didn\\'t sit well with investors. The Pew Research Center reported Wednesday that 23 percent of all American adults online use Twitter, but that user growth among U.S. adults has slowed to a halt. The stock closed at $26 per share, down more than 5 percent for the day, and was relatively flat in after-hours trading.\\n\\nGoogle, Amazon in fray to buy Tata\\'s India Data centres:\\xa0Google and Amazon are among those in talks with the Tata Group to buy the data centre business of Tata Communications in a deal expected to fetch about $650-700 million. They are competing with bulge-bracket private equity funds including the Blackstone Group, Carlyle, KKR, Bain Capital and Advent International, who are all looking to buy up to 74% stake in the data centre unit and take control of the business that is spread across 44 locations in India and abroad. Besides India, Tata Communications has data centres in the US, UK and Singapore, with over 1 million sq ft of co-location space, offering managed hosting and storage services. In India, it has facilities in leading metros such as New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata and Pune, besides some tier-II and tier-III locations. The data centre business addedRs 436 crore to Tata Communications\\' FY15 revenues and has about 27% EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), the company said in an investor presentation last month after its June quarter earnings.\\n\\nSalesforce raises full-year revenue forecast again:\\xa0Salesforce.com reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit, helped by an increase in demand for its Web-based sales and marketing software, and raised its revenue forecast for the full year for the third time. Revenue rose 24 percent to $1.63 billion, beating analysts\\' average estimate of $1.60 billion, and the company\\'s net loss narrowed to $852,000 in the second quarter from $61.1 million a year earlier. The company\\'s shares rose about 4 percent in extended trading after the world\\'s biggest maker of online sales software also forecast current-quarter revenue and adjusted profit above the average analyst estimates. \"... We\\'ll go from being the sixth largest software company in the world to the fourth largest next year,\" Chief Executive Marc Benioff said on a conference call, adding that the company would only lag Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. Salesforce raised its revenue forecast for the year ending January 2016 to $6.60 billion-$6.63 billion from $6.52 billion-$6.55 billion. San Francisco-based Salesforce has been gaining market share from Oracle and SAP in customer relationship management software that helps companies organize and track sales calls and leads. Salesforce, which provides its services online, with no software directly installed on PCs, leads the global customer relationship management market, which is valued at $23 billion annually, according to tech research firm Gartner.\\n\\nGlobal Smartphone Sales Growth Slowed in Second Quarter:\\xa0The research firm Gartner said worldwide sales of smartphones in the second quarter grew at the slowest pace since 2013 as sales in China declined for the first time. Sales grew 13.5 percent to 330 million units in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. While demand continues to increase in emerging markets, Gartner says overall smartphone sales were mixed. Smartphone sales in China fell 4 percent year-over-year. China accounted for 30 percent of total smartphone sales in the second quarter, but Gartner says its phone market has reached saturation.\\n\\nHP revenue falls on weak PC sales, lower demand for services:\\xa0The 76-year-old company, which has struggled to adapt to mobiles and online computing, is splitting into two listed companies later this year, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations. HP is nearing the end of a multi-year restructuring under Whitman, who has been cutting costs and focusing on higher-margin sales. The plan includes the elimination of about 55,000 jobs. The decline in global PC sales was exacerbated in the second quarter of 2015 as customers awaited the release of Windows 10 in July. As a result, revenue at HP\\'s personal computer and printer businesses, its largest, fell 11.5 percent in the third quarter ended July 31. Enterprise services division sales dropped 11 percent, while revenue at the enterprise group rose 2 percent. For the full-year ending October, the company said it expected adjusted profit of $3.59-$3.65 per share, largely below the average analyst estimate of $3.64 per share. Total revenue fell 8.1 percent to $25.35 billion in the third quarter, also hurt by a strong dollar.\\n\\nAfter Years Of Restraint, Facebook Tries Allowing GIFs In Ads And Page Posts:\\xa0Facebook refused to fill its site with flashy animated banner ads for a decade. Zuckerberg thought these interrupted the user experience, and could stunt growth. But after reaching near ubiquity and acclimating users to video ads, today the company tells me it’s relaxing its standards and starting to allow businesses to post GIFs as ads and Page posts. Wendy’s and Coca-Cola’s Brazilian brand Kuat are the first businesses with the ability to share them. Wendy’s ad shows a salad being constructed, while Kuat’s is basically the rainbow-shooting poptart meme Nyan Cat with a brand name slapped on. GIFs can’t go in the tiny sidebar ads Facebook is phasing out, only “Boosted” Page posts, which make up most of the ads you see in your feed. The social network started supporting GIFs in user posts starting in May, but hadn’t allowed businesses to try the hip graphic interchange format all the kids are Tumbling over. Facebook tells me “GIFs can be a fun and compelling way to communicate, so we’ve started testing GIF support in posts and boosted posts for a small percentage of Facebook Pages. We will evaluate whether it drives a great experience for people before rolling it out to more Pages.” So basically, if users hate them and they don’t perform well, Facebook will scrap them. But if the eyegrabbing ads and Page posts drive business without annoying the hell out of people, all companies might soon get the option to animate your News Feed. GIFs are the visual equivalent of shouting. You have to really care about the message or you’d prefer they just shut up.\\n\\nGoogle Express Plans to Shut Down Its Two Delivery Hubs:\\xa0Google Express, the search giant’s same-day delivery service, is shutting down its two delivery hubs in San Francisco and Mountain View, Calif., according to sources. The move is part of a broader push within Google to revamp the service, which launched in March 2013, after it failed to make a serious dent in a market crowded with Amazon and a myriad of on-demand startups. The service is not shutting down, but seems to be recalibrating a logistical plan it was testing in California. Express was hatched out of Google’s commerce plans, formed, in part, to hedge against Amazon’s growing foray into product searches. It is now in seven major cities. In most of them, Google delivers goods from retail and shipping partners. When the service arrived in the Bay Area, Google tried out a hub model. Customers would order from Google’s retail partners, and drivers delivered the goods from the two locations on the same day or overnight. Now, Google is changing course. And the change comes after a tumultuous year for the company’s commerce initiatives: It lost the exec atop Express, Tom Fallows, then the exec atop all of commerce, Sameer Samat. After Fallows’s departure, Google shook up the Express leadership multiple times, putting the business development lead for Google Shopping, Brian Elliott, at its helm in July. Rising costs of the drivers and vehicles are likely one rationale. According to multiple sources, Google is trying to curb these by outsourcing its delivery to other on-demand startups and has held initial talks with multiple companies, including Postmates and Flywheel.\\n\\n\\n')\n",

The investment by Tata Opportunities Fund will allow Uber to benefit from its network in the country, Tata Capital said in an e-mailed statement on Wednesday, without elaborating. Tata Capital is part of the $109 billion coffee-to-cars conglomerate with over 100 group firms. The fund typically invests up to $100 million in its deals, its managing partner Padmanabh Sinha said. Uber in July said it would spend $1 billion to fan out to more Indian cities as the ride-hailing company targets to reach 1 million trips per day in the next six to nine months. Microsoft Corp. is said to have agreed to invest about $100 million in Uber valuing it at about $50 billion.\\n\\nTaxi app GrabTaxi raises $350 million from CIC, others:\\xa0Taxi-booking app GrabTaxi said it raised over $350 million from investors including sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation, in the Southeast Asian company\\'s largest ever fundraising round. Other investors include hedge fund Coatue Management LLC and China\\'s mobile car-ride hailing company Didi Kuaidi, GrabTaxi said in a statement, adding that it would use the funds to expand its private vehicle hire and motorbike booking services and invest in technology. Singapore-headquartered GrabTaxi competes with the likes of Uber and Rocket Internet\\'s Easy Taxi in the city-state and some of the other Southeast Asian markets in which it operates.\\n\\nHacker\\'s Ashley Madison data dump threatens marriages, reputations:\\xa0Love lives and reputations may be at risk after the release of customer data from infidelity website Ashley Madison, an unprecedented breach of privacy likely to rattle users\\' attitudes towards the Internet. Hackers dumped a big cache of data containing millions of email addresses for U.S. government officials, UK civil servants and high-level executives at European and North America corporations late on Tuesday, the latest cyber attack to raise concerns about Internet security and data protection. The hacker attack has been a big blow to Toronto-based assignation website firm Avid Life Media, which owns Ashley Madison and has indefinitely postponed the adultery site\\'s IPO plans. The data dump began to make good on the hackers\\' threat last month to leak nude photos, sexual fantasies, real names and credit card information for as many as 37 million customers worldwide of Ashley Madison, which uses the slogan: \"Life is short. Have an affair.\" The hackers\\' move to identify members of the marital cheating website appeared aimed at maximum damage to the company, which also runs websites such as Cougarlife.com and EstablishedMen.com, causing public embarrassment to its members, rather than financial gain.\\n\\nChinese Consumers are skipping straight from cash to mobile finance:\\xa0Financial innovation is bubbling up around the globe, but China is where digital banking, investing, and lending have gone mainstream. Technology companies armed with financial apps are challenging banks and other intermediaries for a market with 1.3 billion people and $7.8 trillion of deposits. Tencent’s WeChat (called Weixin in Chinese), Alibaba’s Alipay arm, and Baidu are leading the way with digital wallets that let consumers manage their money via their phones. Traditional banking in China is balky, backward, and inefficient—creating ample opportunities for nimble tech companies such as Alibaba and Baidu. The huge, state-owned banks do some lending to consumers and private businesses, but they typically prefer making loans to state-owned enterprises that provide implicit government guarantees. For consumers, the government banks offer low interest rates on savings accounts, making new online funds and financial products with higher rates attractive. Regulators have indicated they are open to innovation. For one thing, digital banking leaves a trail that cash doesn’t. And it might help the Chinese government get a clearer snapshot of economic activity.\\n\\nMood-based playlists: How Spotify reinvented the playlist:\\xa0Increasingly, music listeners are shifting away from genre labels like Hip-hop, R&B and Jazz, according to Spotify. What they really want is a set of tunes to fit their mood. It took Spotify a great deal of testing and data-crunching to arrive at that revelation. And it isn\\'t stopping there. It\\'s taking what it\\'s gleaned from millions of users\\' listening habits to craft a new kind of song entirely: One that intensifies along with your running workout, matching its beats to your precise pace. When you speed up, it speeds up. When you slow down, it does, too. When Spotify began mixing its own playlists and tagging them (\"Focus\" for people who needed music to work to, or \"Dinnertime Acoustic\" for unwinding) it noticed a big uptick in interest, particularly when mood-based playlists were displayed right beside a traditional genre, according to Mark Silverstein, Spotify\\'s head of product, tech and policy. Mood-based playlists aren\\'t just different collections of songs; in the case of Spotify\\'s commuting playlists, the company will occasionally mix in news, weather reports, even audio clips of Jimmy Fallon for some comedic diversity. As a result, fewer people began selecting genre playlists, and many more began opting for the mood-based playlists. And that carried over into the playlists people were making for themselves. That prompted Spotify to begin thinking about running more closely. For years, scientists have theorized about a link between music and exercise. One 2007 study suggested that fast, loud music was associated with faster running speeds and an increased heart rate. Another found in 2011 that music helped triathlon runners stave off exhaustion and run nearly 20 percent longer than their peers who ran in silence.\\n\\nSnapchat’s leaked financials show just how big a bullet Facebook dodged: Snapchat may be the best $3 billion Facebook never spent.:\\xa0People are all abuzz about Snapchat\\'s financials, which were leaked online Wednesday. If you haven\\'t seen them, the outlook isn\\'t good: Snapchat lost $128 million during the first 11 months of 2014. And it took in just $3 million in revenue over the same period, according to records obtained by Gawker. It\\'s clear whom the leaked numbers hurt the most: chief executive Evan Spiegel and his investors. But if there\\'s a winner in all this, it\\'s Mark Zuckerberg. Snapchat, of course, was the company that famously rebuffed Facebook\\'s offer of a $3 billion acquisition. Spiegel could have walked away with a huge sum of money. Instead, he\\'s managing a struggling business that — almost four years, a big data breach and a Federal Trade Commission settlement later — still lacks a clear road to profitability. There\\'s also nothing particularly surprising about a startup losing money; it would be unreasonable to expect massive profits right out of the gate. But of course, Snapchat has been out of the gate for some time now, and it\\'s part of an ecosystem that\\'s only grown more crowded and less compelling as a representation of The Future. Snapchat is also struggling because it\\'s working in a market that\\'s grown increasingly commoditized. There\\'s an app for everything these days. Tell the average consumer you\\'ve come up with a hot new app and they\\'re as likely to roll their eyes as to download it. Snapchat may be valued at $15 billion, but it\\'s also part of a recent explosion in so-called \"unicorns\" (companies valued at $1 billion or more) that some venture capitalists think is unsustainable. Snapchat may be the best $3 billion Facebook never spent.\\n\\nAdoption of ad blockers is rising steeply, and could have serious consequences for the online advertising industry:\\xa0Ad blocking has been around for years, but adoption is now rising steeply, at a pace that some in the ad industry say could prove catastrophic for the economic structure underlying the web. That has spurred a debate about the ethic of ad blocking. Some publishers and advertisers say ad blocking violates the implicit contract that girds the Internet — the idea that in return for free content, we all tolerate a constant barrage of ads.But in the long run, there could be a hidden benefit to blocking ads for advertisers and publishers: Ad blockers could end up saving the ad industry from its worst excesses. If blocking becomes widespread, the ad industry will be pushed to produce ads that are simpler, less invasive and far more transparent about the way they’re handling our data — or risk getting blocked forever if they fail. In a report last week, Adobe and PageFair, an Irish start-up that tracks ad-blocking, estimated that blockers will cost publishers nearly $22 billion in revenue this year. Nearly 200 million people worldwide regularly block ads, the report said, and the number is growing fast, increasing 41 percent globally in the last year. Today ad-blocking is mostly restricted to desktop web browsers. But iOS 9, Apple’s latest mobile operating system, will include support for ad blockers when it becomes available in the fall. Several ad-blocking firms are already creating apps for the new OS; when it’s out, you’ll simply download an ad blocker and no longer have to see ads on the iPhone’s version of Safari and possibly in other apps that open web links. PageFair also sells technology that allows web publishers to determine if users are running blocking software — and then serves them ads anyway, going around the blockers. PageFair’s software, which Mr. Blanchfield said is currently being tested with a number of large websites, circumvents ad blocking by using “low-level networking” technology that he declined to detail in order to stay ahead of ad companies. Showing ads to people who have downloaded ad blockers sounds a little spammy. But in a twist, it may also lead to better ads. Here’s how: PageFair’s canny strategy to mitigate users’ outrage is that it will only show ads that aren’t “intrusive,” Mr. Blanchfield said. That means the ads won’t feature animations, they won’t block content, and they won’t load “trackers” that monitor and report back to some unknown server what you do on a web page.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFoxconn, Alibaba, others invest $500M in Snapdeal; eBay pares stake:\\xa0Online marketplace Snapdeal raised $500 million in fresh funding led by iPhone manufacturer Foxconn, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and existing investor SoftBank. Its other existing investors Temasek, BlackRock, Myriad and PremjiInvest also participated in this round, as per a press statement. Separately, e-commerce giant eBay said it has sold a portion of its holding in Snapdeal, 18 months after leading a $134 million funding round in the Gurgaon-based company. Snapdeal will use the money to expand geographical reach and enhance services in a bid to better compete with well-funded rivals such as US-headquartered Amazon and Bangalore-based Flipkart. The announcement confirms a previous report that said Snapdeal has raised $500 million, citing sources. With the latest funding, Alibaba is now backing two companies (Snapdeal and Paytm) who are directly slugging it out for supremacy in India’s consumer internet space.\\n\\nUpstarts Raid Giants for Talent in Silicon Valley:\\xa0The unicorns, a class of hot start-ups valued at $1 billion or more, are all aggressively pursuing the best and brightest minds in Silicon Valley with promises of talked-about workplaces and eye-popping payouts. Amid a general scramble for talent, Google, the Internet search company, has undergone specific raids from unicorns for engineers who specialize in crucial technologies like mapping. In particular, Uber — the largest unicorn, with a valuation of more than $50 billion — has plundered Google’s mapping unit over the last 12 months, aiming to bolster its own map research. Airbnb, the popular short-term rental start-up, has gone on a more general hiring spree, poaching more than 100 workers. While the unicorns typically pick off small groups of engineers at a time, making little impression on a large company’s total employee numbers, the poaching attacks are often aimed at siphoning off the best talent in strategic technologies. That can sting the likes of a Google, where executives have said one skilled engineer can be worth many times the average. To snag employees from large rivals, unicorns have a simple recruiting pitch: They are on a path to success, as illustrated by their rising valuations. Many offer generous equity packages of restricted stock units that can later translate to big paydays for employees if the unicorn goes public or is sold — a lure that neither Google nor any other public tech company can dangle. Also, the unicorns say they are far more fleet-footed and cutting-edge than large organizations.\\n\\nAlibaba Cash-Burning Buybacks Make Internet Bonds China’s Worst:\\xa0China’s Internet bonds are lagging behind as disappointing earnings and plans for buybacks to shore up slumping shares fuel concern finances will deteriorate. Alibaba, China’s largest e-commerce company, announced a $4 billion share repurchase last week, while Baidu, its most-popular search engine, unveiled a $1 billion plan in July. Their bonds have contributed to a 0.4 percent loss on technology notes this quarter, the worst sector in a Bank of America Merrill Lynch investment-grade dollar note index for China that gained 0.4 percent. That’s a turnaround after Baidu’s 2012 debut in global debt markets gave it a self-proclaimed “war chest” and Alibaba’s $8 billion sale in 2014 became Asia’s biggest corporate dollar bond offering. The companies’ shares have slumped at least 9 percent this quarter as authorities tighten controls on Web content and crack down on fake goods online. “Companies such as Baidu and Alibaba came out with weaker results, and have announced cash-burning buybacks or acquisitions, which triggered a sell-off,” said Anthony Leung, a credit analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Hong Kong, said. “In addition, regular negative headlines such as the sale of counterfeit goods, have hurt their bonds.”\\n\\nLenovo Joins Smartphone Compatriots for ’Make in India’:\\xa0Lenovo started making smartphones in India, becoming the largest Chinese company to produce mobile devices there after the government raised import taxes. Lenovo will use contract manufacturer Flex’s factory outside the southeastern city of Chennai for its Lenovo and Motorola brands, Amar Babu, chairman of Lenovo India, said Tuesday in a phone interview. The brands will have a combined annual capacity of 6 million units, Lenovo said in a statement. Foxconn Technology Group this year began producing smartphones in India for China’s Xiaomi and OnePlus after the Indian government raised taxes on some foreign-made goods to attract investment in manufacturing. Lenovo’s announcement marks the largest Chinese name yet to be lured by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Make in India campaign as competitors vie for a share of the world’s third-largest smartphone market. “Output from the plants is focused mainly on serving the Indian market,” Babu said. Lenovo has no immediate plans to develop phones specifically for India, he said. Lenovo considered adding smartphone manufacturing to its own personal-computer plant in Puducherry in the southeast before deciding to outsource to Flex’s existing factory in Sriperumbudur, Babu said.\\n\\nAirbnb partners with China Broadband, Sequoia to expand in China:\\xa0Online home-rental marketplace Airbnb Inc said on Tuesday it was partnering with investment firms China Broadband Capital and Sequoia China to expand into the Chinese market and find a chief executive for its operations in the country. The company, which was recently reported to have completed a $1.5 billion private funding round, said in a blog post it was also working with a larger group of investors, including Horizon Ventures, GGV Capital and China-based Hillhouse Capital. Airbnb, which matches people wishing to rent out all or part of their homes to temporary guests, has grown quickly and is valued at more than $20 billion. Airbnb said the number of outbound Chinese travelers using its service grew 700 percent in the past year. China Broadband and Sequoia China will help it customize technology for the Chinese market and establish a \"localized presence\" in the country, it added.\\n\\nTwitter to accelerate push for content partnerships in Asia:\\xa0Twitter said on Tuesday it plans to accelerate its push for content partnerships in Asia Pacific and the Middle East. It has appointed a Singapore-based executive, Rishi Jaitly, to boost teams in major markets such as Australia, India, and Japan as well as to expand into Greater China and Southeast Asia, the company said in a statement. Jaitly was previously Twitter\\'s market director for India and Southeast Asia. Twitter has been aggressively expanding its capabilities to carry pictures, video and interactive content.\\n\\nKik Takes $50 Million Investment From WeChat Parent Company Tencent, Hits $1 Billion Valuation:\\xa0Kik Takes $50 Million Investment From WeChat Parent Company Tencent, Hits $1 Billion Valuation. The app has 240 million registered users and claims that 40 percent of American teenagers are actively on Kik. The deal doesn’t mean the two apps are planning to integrate, but they will have a strategic partnership moving forward, according to Kik co-founder Chris Best. That means sharing things like data and app information, he added. He also said that Kik won’t be targeting China anytime soon (seems obvious now given WeChat’s foothold there) but plans to use the money to grow the company’s employee base.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber’s Popularity in India Has Led to a Mini Vehicle Boom:\\xa0Uber has posed a threat to auto sales by enticing car owners to ditch their keys. In India, its popularity has sparked a vehicle boom instead. Maruti Suzuki has seen a surge in demand for its DZire Tour sedan because of the rising popularity of car-booking apps, said R.S. Kalsi, executive director at India’s largest carmaker. Toyota Motor is offering special deals to woo drivers and fleet operators that are boosting orders for its Etios sedan, which starts at 611,000 rupees ($9,400). Uber and other booking apps have announced plans to expand to smaller cities in India, where public transportation is often inadequate. The services have created a boom in demand from for-hire car companies expanding their fleets and from individual operators buying new cars to drive for the apps. “The plans of all these companies are big,” said N. Raja, director and senior vice president for sales and marketing at Toyota’s India unit. “We’re happy to see them talking about expanding the number of cars in the next 12 months.” In the four months through July, Maruti Suzuki’s DZire Tour, sold only as a taxi, surged 152 percent while Toyota’s Etios compact sedan gained 28 percent. Industrywide passenger-vehicle sales expanded 7.5 percent in the same period. The surge in demand for these cheaper models is helping to drive a recovery in vehicle sales in India. Automakers like Maruti Suzuki get about a third of their sales volume from rural areas, where incomes are correlated to rainfall during the monsoon season and a good harvest.\\n\\nA Gushing Review for Windows 10: \"I used to doubt Microsoft. Then I installed Windows 10\":\\xa0I don’t know if I broke a law of computing or committed heresy. But I installed Windows 10 on my Macbook Pro. I had feared that this would condemn me to purgatory in the gates of computing hell. But it has been an incredibly positive experience: my favorite Microsoft Office applications — Outlook, Word, and PowerPoint — work faster than ever before, and I can still use Apple peripherals — a Thunderbolt Display and Thunderbolt external hard drives. The best part is Windows 10 itself: it is a beautifully designed operating system that gives me the best of the past and present — maintaining the usability and familiarity of the old Windows operating system, and letting me download slick apps designed for tablets. Another Microsoft product that I had written off years ago is Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. The jury is still out, but Microsoft’s new browser, Edge, seems faster than Google’s Chrome. I may end up switching browsers as well. What is clear is that Microsoft is back — in full force. This is a good thing; Apple and Google desperately need the competition that Microsoft will once again provide.\\n\\nAndroid Has a New Name, ‘Marshmallow,’ but the Same Old Security Problem:\\xa0Android’s latest version now has its own culinary sobriquet: Marshmallow. But the release of the operating system, announced in May and arriving this fall, doesn’t address one of the biggest issues facing Android — its security model. Last month, a security researcher discovered a software bug, called Stagefright, that could potentially threaten millions of Android devices. Google acknowledge the bug and sent out a patch to manufacturers and carriers to fix. Then last week, a different security firm found another vulnerability; this one was in Google’s patch. Google said it has since released a fix for that hole, which affects Nexus devices. Still, both findings underscore the nagging headache Google has built with an OS so reliant on hardware partners, many of whom are struggling to maintain profits. And it shows that Google will continue to wrestle with the issues as Android moves onto other devices, like cars, wearables and home automation. “The whole Android ecosystem is a mess,” said Aaron Portnoy, vice president of Exodus Intelligence, the firm that spotted the second hole. The primary issue is that Google is not fully in control of its own destiny, with updates typically needing the okay of device makers and carriers before making their way to consumers, who also have to update their devices. Contrast that with Apple, which is largely able to push updates on its own. The security issues facing Google are reminiscent of those that faced Windows back in the day. The operating system, dominant in the PC world, found itself the increasing center of attacks. Adding to the issue was the fact that businesses were reticent to update their servers and PCs without doing independent testing.\\n\\n4 Major Publishers Can Now Put Ads in Their Online Comment Sections:\\xa0It was only a matter of time before marketers started squeezing native ads into every nook of a publisher\\'s site, and now Condé Nast, The Wall Street Journal, CNN and Fox News can sell promos that pop up in story comments. Today, Livefyre—a tech company that powers online discussions—is unveiling sponsored comments for big-name media brands like the ones mentioned above. While the idea of in-feed ads isn\\'t new (competitor Disqus launched similar promos last year), Livefyre\\'s ads are sold directly by publishers, opening up a potentially interesting revenue stream for them. \"You can distribute more ads into the page, especially if there are 100 comments on the page,\" said Jordan Kretchmer, Livefyre\\'s founder and CEO. \"Typically, by the time the user is down there reading the comments, there\\'s no ads around it—all the ads are up above the fold.\" In addition to selling the ads, publishers will also control how often they pop up. For example, a media company may only want to serve a promo in one out of every six comments. Of course, plugging ads right next to trolls and negative discussions is a risky move for brands. To control the environment as much as possible, Kretchmer said the majority of his company\\'s clients already use automated moderation tools that weed out spammy posts such as those from rogue e-commerce marketers. \"The risk is far less today than it would have been a couple of years ago,\" he said. Kretchmer also explained the ads are targeted based on editorial content. For example, Nike can set up a campaign that only runs on sports articles. \"Users who are reading and leaving comments are the most engaged users on a site,\" Kretchmer explained. \"With customers who have a good, active community, comments are where they spend most of their time, and in a lot of times, [they spend] more time reading the comments than the article itself.\"\\n\\nAmazon’s $5 Dash Button Already Hacked To Do Other Stuff Beyond Giving Amazon Money:\\xa0Need something to spark a bit of creativity this week? How about a super clever hack for Amazon’s $5, single-purpose Dash buttons? The Dash buttons were originally meant to serve as a quick way to reorder household goods you order often (Order a lot of laundry detergent? Stick a Dash button on your washing machine, press it when you’re running low. Bam. Ordered.), but Cloudstitch CTO Ted Benson has found a way to make them do pretty much anything he wants. You can read Benson’s full breakdown right over here, but here’s the gist: Benson noticed that the Dash sends out a unique signal each and every time it’s pressed. Rather than opening up the Dash and modifying the hardware itself (which would probably require all sorts of painful/tedious chip flashing), Benson sniffs the network for that signal. When it’s detected, he can fire a script to do just about whatever he wants. In his demo use case, he’s using it to record when his baby’s diaper gets changed into a Google Spreadsheet, while a second button records when his baby wakes from a nap. To keep the Dash from ordering any products when you press it, you just… don’t configure it to order a product during the inital setup. If you never enter a SKU, it won’t have anything to order. One catch: whereas the factory Dash can act on its own, a modified Dash will need something — a computer, generally — awake and running on your network to sniff out the button presses and respond accordingly. It complicates the equation a bit, but it’s still a fun hack.\\n\\nJeff Bezos responds to New York Times article on Amazon\\'s Culture:\\xa0Amabots and Amholes; employees sobbing at their desks; colleagues spamming the internal employee-review tool in an attempt to eject their managers from the company; cancer survivors returning to work, only to be put on “performance improvement plans.” These and other rich anecdotes made the New York Times broadside against Amazon an entertaining and brutal read, which drew a rebuke from the company’s top dog. Amazon.com Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos wrote a memo to his employees last night contesting the Times article and asking anyone who witnesses such displays of corporate callousness to report it to human resources or e-mail the CEO. “I don’t recognize this Amazon, and I very much hope you don’t, either,” Bezos wrote. “I strongly believe that anyone working in a company that really is like the one described in the NYT would be crazy to stay. I know I would leave such a company.” But there’s now plenty of fodder to support the narrative that the secretive beast is not always a pleasant place to work. While 82 percent of respondents on the job-search site Glassdoor say they approve of the CEO, only 62 percent would recommend a job there to a friend. That’s much lower than Amazon’s peers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTiger Global Adds to China’s JD.com Before Tumble, Buys Amazon:\\xa0Tiger Global Management more than doubled its stake in JD.com before the stock tumbled this month on worries about increased competition for the online retailer and a slowing Chinese economy. Tiger Global became the third-biggest holder of JD.com American depositary receipts, with a position valued at $2.4 billion as of June 30, according to a quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The shares have dropped 18 percent since the end of the quarter. The money manager added to its position in Netflix, acquiring 16.9 million shares. The stake of 18 million shares was valued at $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter. The firm took new positions in Amazon.com Inc., worth $324.3 million, and TripAdvisor Inc., valued at $106.5 million. Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in equities in the U.S. must file a Form 13F within 45 days of each quarter’s end to list those stocks as well as options and convertible bonds. The filings don’t show non-U.S. securities, holdings that aren’t publicly traded, or cash.\\n\\nAT&T Helped U.S. Spy on Internet on a Vast Scale:\\xa0The National Security Agency’s ability to spy on vast quantities of Internet traffic passing through the United States has relied on its extraordinary, decades-long partnership with a single company: the telecom giant AT&T.While it has been long known that American telecommunications companies worked closely with the spy agency, newly disclosed N.S.A. documents show that the relationship with AT&T has been considered unique and especially productive. One document described it as “highly collaborative,” while another lauded the company’s “extreme willingness to help.” The N.S.A.’s top-secret budget in 2013 for the AT&T partnership was more than twice that of the next-largest such program, according to the documents. The company installed surveillance equipment in at least 17 of its Internet hubs on American soil, far more than its similarly sized competitor, Verizon. And its engineers were the first to try out new surveillance technologies invented by the eavesdropping agency. One document reminds N.S.A. officials to be polite when visiting AT&T facilities, noting, “This is a partnership, not a contractual relationship.”\\n\\nInside Amazon: Wrestling Big Ideas in a Bruising Workplace:\\xa0At Amazon, workers are encouraged to tear apart one another’s ideas in meetings, toil long and late (emails arrive past midnight, followed by text messages asking why they were not answered), and held to standards that the company boasts are “unreasonably high.” The internal phone directory instructs colleagues on how to send secret feedback to one another’s bosses. Employees say it is frequently used to sabotage others. (The tool offers sample texts, including this: “I felt concerned about his inflexibility and openly complaining about minor tasks.”) While the Amazon campus appears similar to those of some tech giants — with its dog-friendly offices, work force that skews young and male, on-site farmers’ market and upbeat posters — the company is considered a place apart. Google and Facebook motivate employees with gyms, meals and benefits, like cash handouts for new parents, “designed to take care of the whole you,” as Google puts it. Amazon, though, offers no pretense that catering to employees is a priority. Compensation is considered competitive — successful midlevel managers can collect the equivalent of an extra salary from grants of a stock that has increased more than tenfold since 2008. But workers are expected to embrace “frugality” (No. 9), from the bare-bones desks to the cellphones and travel expenses that they often pay themselves. (No daily free food buffets or regular snack supplies, either.) The focus is on relentless striving to please customers, or “customer obsession” (No. 1), with words like “mission” used to describe lightning-quick delivery of Cocoa Krispies or selfie sticks. “One time I didn’t sleep for four days straight,” said Dina Vaccari, who joined in 2008 to sell Amazon gift cards to other companies and once used her own money, without asking for approval, to pay a freelancer in India to enter data so she could get more done. “These businesses were my babies, and I did whatever I could to make them successful.” David Loftesness, a senior developer, said he admired the customer focus but could not tolerate the hostile language used in many meetings, a comment echoed by many others. For years, he and his team devoted themselves to improving the search capabilities of Amazon’s website — only to discover that Mr. Bezos had greenlighted a secret competing effort to build an alternate technology. “I’m not going to be the kind of person who can work in this environment,” he said he concluded. He went on to become a director of engineering at Twitter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSamsung Introduces New Phones and Mobile Payments System:\\xa0The South Korean manufacturer introduced two big-screen Galaxy phones on Thursday: the Note 5, which includes a digital pen, and the S6 Edge Plus, which has a curved screen that wraps around the sides of the phone and skips the pen. The Note 5 is slightly thinner than its predecessor, the Note 4, and has some software twists. For one, you can jot down notes with the pen even when the screen is off. You can also scribble notes on digital documents before sending them. The S6 Edge Plus can be customized so that the curved edges can quickly show your favorite apps or contacts by swiping from the sides. Both phones have 5.7-inch screens and support wireless power charging. While the phones are now available for ordering online, pricing and official release dates have yet to be announced. The new devices follow Samsung’s April release of the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, which will soon get price cuts after the company reported earlier this month that its profit had declined for the seventh quarter in a row. Analysts say that Apple‘s introduction last year of big-screen phones, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, as well as competition from Chinese handset makers like Xiaomi, are chipping into Samsung’s profit. Samsung on Thursday also introduced its mobile wallet system, a rival to the Apple Pay system and Google‘s Android Pay. The new wallet, Samsung Pay, is similar to Apple and Google’s offerings, and will work with a handful of previously released Samsung devices.\\n\\nApple might be bringing fighter-jet technology to car windshields:\\xa0The world’s most valuable company is “very likely” working on a 27- to 50-inch head-up display, a technology most famously used by jet pilots, that could project vivid icons and information for drivers while on the road, a tech analyst with Global Equities Research said Thursday morning. The curved-glass screen could also be wired with sensors and “may be completely gesture-controlled,” a stealth project that analyst Trip Chowdhry said could be Apple’s “next generation” device, after gadgets such as the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. Rumors about Apple’s secret innovations have become a regular pastime for the many tea-leaf readers of Silicon Valley, and Chowdhry, who seems to be the only analyst so far to suggest Apple is working on a HUD, has been wrong before. But if Apple’s head-up display really is in the works, it could mark a huge leap for the $660 billion gorilla into an industry already packed with big-money carmakers and tech firms, and further embolden the idea that Apple is looking to stake new territory on the world’s roads. Apple’s hiring of auto-industry specialists and sightings in California of Apple-leased camera-mounted vans have fueled rumors that the software-hardware company is looking to build its own kind of car. In February, Reuters and the Wall Street Journal said that hundreds of Apple employees were working on a self-driving minivan, code-named Project Titan.\\n\\nUber Says Its Chinese Arm Could Eventually Go Public in China:\\xa0As Uber Technologies raises money from private investors for its Chinese business, the ride-hailing company says the offshoot could one day list shares on the stock market in China. However, Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick is a staunch proponent of companies staying private as long as possible, and the same is true for the Chinese unit, says Nairi Hourdajian, a spokeswoman for the company. “Of course there is the possibility that Uber China, which is a separate entity, could at some point in the future list on the Chinese stock market,” Hourdajian wrote in an e-mail. “But as Travis has always made clear, there are many advantages, for investors, to Uber being a private company, in particular having the freedom to take long-term bets.” The prospect for an Uber China initial public offering has been a hot topic of conversation in the local press recently. Liu Zhen, who heads Uber’s strategy in China, was quoted in the Beijing News as saying the Chinese unit may publicly list in the country. She also said the company—called Youbu, meaning “an excellent step forward”—operates as an independent corporate entity with support from Uber as a strategic investor, according to the report. Kalanick is currently running Uber’s Chinese arm, along with the global business, while the company seeks to hire someone to lead the operation. That person would probably report to Kalanick. The San Francisco company is aiming to raise $1 billion for Uber China at a valuation between $7 billion to $8 billion, two people familiar with the matter said in July. The Chinese search giant Baidu, which is already an investor in Uber, is expected to participate in the round, the people said. Uber is attempting to do what many other American technology companies have failed to do: compete with a homegrown tech company in mainland China. Uber is engaged in an intense fight with Didi Kuaidi, which was recently valued by investors at $15 billion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba Skids as Revenue Growth Slowest in Three Years; $4 Billion Stock Buyback Is Planned as Stock Plunges 5% to New Low:\\xa0Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\\'s shares fell to a record low after China\\'s biggest e-commerce company posted its slowest revenue growth in over three years as its strategy to shift more services to mobile devices hurt advertising sales. The company\\'s shares declined as much as 8 percent to $71.03 - just shy of their IPO price of $68 - wiping off nearly $16 billion from its market value on Wednesday. The stock has lost declined nearly 30 percent this year, up to Wednesday\\'s close. Alibaba also announced a $4 billion share repurchase program over two years, aimed at offsetting the impact of its share-based compensation programs. The company\\'s results come at a time when China\\'s economy is expected to grow at its slowest pace in a quarter of a century. Adding to investor concerns, China devalued the yuan on Tuesday, guiding the currency to its lowest point in almost three years. mobile was still less profitable than business via personal computers, where profitability also decreased. Revenue for the three months through June rose 28 percent to $3.27 billion, well below forecast. Gross merchandise volume (GMV) -- the total value of goods transacted across Alibaba\\'s platforms -- rose 34 percent to 673 billion yuan ($105 billion), also the slowest growth in more than three years.\\n\\nOnline grocer BigBasket raises $50M from Bessemer, others:\\xa0Online grocery retailer BigBasket.com, has raised $50 million in a fresh round of funding led by existing investor Bessemer Venture Partners. The Times of India, which first reported the development citing BigBasket CEO Hari Menon, said BigBasket has also mandated Citigroup to raise $150 million (Rs 950 crore) from new investors. The new round of funding, which values BigBasket at $1 billion, will power the company’s plans to enter 50 more Tier-II cities, the report said. BigBasket.com is an online grocery store with operations in Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Delhi-NCR and Mysore. It was founded by a team of five in 2011. The team has both offline and online retail experience, as it had earlier set up India’s first e-commerce site FabMart.com in 1999, and then established the Fabmall-Trinethra chain of more than 200 grocery supermarket stores in southern India. Trinethra was sold to Aditya Birla Group in 2006 and currently operates under the brand name ‘More’. The startup has investments from Bessemer Venture Partners, Helion Venture Partners and Zodius Capital. It was valued at Rs 1,400 crore when it last raised funds in January. The company is understood to have closed fiscal 2015 with a top-line of Rs 250 crore and a run-rate of 6,000 orders a day with average billing of Rs 1,500 per customer.\\n\\nStrong U.S. sales help Cisco beat estimates:\\xa0Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit as strong demand for its products in the United States more than offset weakness elsewhere. Shares of Cisco, considered a bellwether for the performance of the broader network gear industry, rose nearly 4 percent in extended trading on Wednesday. The company is the market leader in selling network equipment to businesses, controlling about half of the $38 billion global market and overshadowing rivals Hewlett-Packard and China\\'s Huawei, according to market research firm Gartner. For the fourth quarter, the company earned 59 cents per share on an adjusted basis, while revenue rose nearly 4 percent to $12.84 billion. Cisco\\'s latest results also underscore an ongoing recovery in sales of the company\\'s switches and routers, which were hit by a slowdown in spending by telecom carriers, its traditional customers, in the second half of 2014. The company has also been investing in new products and services such as data analytics software, security and cloud-management tools. Cisco said in June it would buy cloud-based security firm OpenDNS for $635 million. The company also said revenue from telecom providers rose 2 percent in the quarter but added that it did not expect an increase in capital spending by its traditional customers.\\n\\nLenovo quarterly revenue misses expectations, announces 10% cuts:\\xa0Lenovo missed quarterly revenue expectations on Thursday and said it plans to lay off about 10 percent of its global non-manufacturing workforce, after posting a steep sales decline in its mobile division. The world\\'s No. 1 PC maker said it plans to cut about 3,200 non-manufacturing positions to save $650 million in the second half of 2015 and about $1.35 billion on an annual basis, reflecting intense competition among global smartphone makers. Chief executive Yuanqing Yang said Lenovo would also restructure its lagging smartphone business at a one-time cost of $600 million, and was facing its \"toughest market environment in recent years\". Lenovo, which last year spent $2.91 billion to buy handset brand Motorola from Google in a bid to solidify its position in smartphones, pointed to \"intensifying competition and long product development lifecycles\" in the business.\\n\\nTinder Invokes North Korea in Strange Response to Vanity Fair Article, then Backtracks:\\xa0Like a person scorned after a bad date, the tech company Tinder went a little bit crazy on social media on Tuesday after Vanity Fair published an article blaming technology for the death of dating. The article, “Tinder and the Dawn of the ‘Dating Apocalypse,’ ” was not just about Tinder — there is a wider Internet at work, the writer Nancy Jo Sales suggested. But the app, which lets users quickly swipe left to signal rejection or right to signal interest, was used to illustrate the problems young daters face when technology fuses short attention spans with too many options. On its official Twitter account, Tinder took issue with the report’s suggestion that its dating app was fueling a culture of casual sex. Tinder’s defense continued for more than 30 posts. The outrage was not lost on Twitter users, who relished the opportunity to point out that Tinder was being awfully thin-skinned. One post came under particular scorn. Tinder said it helped people find friends and make connections in places where Internet use is restricted. The claim that Tinder had “many users” in North Korea prompted a few creative memes featuring that country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and many derisive questions about the extent of Tinder’s user base in China and North Korea. Both countries maintain strict controls on the Internet, and information in general. On Wednesday, Tinder issued a statement acknowledging its outburst. “Our intention was to highlight the many statistics and amazing stories that are sometimes left unpublished, and, in doing so, we overreacted,” the company said\\n\\nWeChat’s Growth Shows Why Messaging Apps Attract Big Valuations:\\xa0For an idea of why messaging applications are attracting valuations in the tens of billions of dollars, look no further than WeChat, a 600 million-user messaging application that’s part of Tencent. WeChat, a smartphone instant-messenger, digital wallet and car-booking service rolled up into one, is probably worth $83.6 billion1, or about half of TenCent\\'s value, according to HSBC. As people spend more and more time sending short messages to each other—instead of, say, browsing websites or shopping online—such services have become some of the hottest technology businesses around. WeChat\\'s user count jumped by 37 percent in the latest quarter, according to Tencent\\'s results—and it isn\\'t even the Internet company’s biggest messaging product. That honor goes to QQ, which has 843 million users. Facebook’s own Messenger has 700 million users. Skype, the Internet calling service operated by Microsoft Corp., also lets people exchange messages and boasts 300 million users. By comparison, Twitter Inc., which is projected to generate $2.24 billion in revenue this year, only has 316 million users. When it comes to innovation, however, WeChat may be far ahead of the pack in terms of money-making opportunities. It already includes shopping and in-app games, features that other services are rushing to replicate, according to Adley Bowden, senior director of analysis at Pitchbook Inc. \"WeChat\\'s success is a little bit of a game-changer in the take on messaging as a platform,\" Bowden said. Line, a messaging app popular in Japan, may soon offer a better picture of how investors are valuing messaging apps. The company, controlled by South Korean search portal Naver Corp., is preparing for a dual listing in Tokyo and New York next month, people with knowledge of the matter said in May. Line, which makes money by selling teddy bear icons and games to its 211 million users, had $223.9 million in revenue in the latest quarter. Competition for users remains fierce. Viber, a popular messaging app, has 249 million users. Kik, a Canadian messaging service, has more than 200 million, while South Korea’s KakaoTalk has 48 million people exchanging messages and photos. Eventually, within three to five years, there will be a few winners that survive, said Gartner\\'s Blau. That will probably involve more acquisitions by the biggest messaging service providers, with the main question being how much further valuations can go.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon quietly shutters product ads that drove traffic to outside sites:\\xa0Amazon.com Inc quietly shuttered a pay-per-click advertising program that allowed businesses to divert traffic from the retailer\\'s platform to their own websites on Tuesday, saying it would permanently discontinue the program in October. The program allowed many businesses that are not necessarily sellers on Amazon\\'s online marketplace to buy ad space on its website. Targeted ads for specific items would pop up on Amazon\\'s website and drive shoppers to the retailer or manufacturer\\'s own site. \"Our customers performed really well with it because it provided a middle ground of being able to partner with Amazon but also not allowing them to see all their transaction data,\" said Scot Wingo, the executive chairman of ChannelAdvisor, which helps retailers and manufacturers sell on ecommerce platforms. Wingo said the program was known for its high conversion rate and said advertisers were surprised when they received an email from Amazon notifying them of the change this week. Amazon\\'s overall advertising business could bring in $1.26 billion in 2015 worldwide and grow to $1.83 billion by 2018, according to estimates from eMarketer, which tracks online advertising.\\n\\nAlibaba Is Planning Its Comeback From the World’s Biggest Wipeout of Market Value:\\xa0It took less than a year for Alibaba to turn from a stock-market darling into the biggest source of shareholder losses worldwide. Alibaba’s fiscal first-quarter sales are projected to climb 33 percent, the weakest pace in at least three years, to 21 billion yuan ($3.3 billion), according to the average of 26 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a mean growth rate of 56 percent for the previous 12 quarters. Alibaba shares closed Tuesday at $77.34, down 35 percent from their Nov. 10 high. While the stock is still trading above its initial public offering price in September, the company has lost the equivalent of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s entire market capitalization since its peak -- the world’s biggest destruction of market value. The Hangzhou-based company is now ranked 24th worldwide with a value of $194 billion. After its record $25 billion IPO and 75 percent surge in the first two months of trading, Alibaba has been hit by a succession of bad news. Now, China’s biggest e-commerce operator is plotting its comeback. This week’s purchase of a stake in Suning -- Chairman Jack Ma’s largest deal ever -- is part of the company’s push to reach millions of new customers in rural China and abroad through a bigger logistics network. Ma is counting on expansion outside China’s largest cities to offset a slowdown in sales growth that helped erase more than $90 billion of market value since Alibaba shares peaked in November. While the strategy may take time to bear fruit, Wall Street is keeping its faith before the release of Alibaba’s quarterly results on Wednesday. Share-price forecasts tracked by Bloomberg imply a 35 percent rally over the next year, the second-biggest projected return among the world’s 25 largest companies.\\n\\nBranch8 Lets Merchants Sell Via Multiple E-Commerce Sites With Fewer Headaches:\\xa0Choice and competition is good for consumers, but it sure makes things tricky for merchants. Assuming that you want to reach shoppers through as many touchpoints as possible (you do), then you’re going to be using a handful of e-commerce sites to sell your stuff in Asia. Beyond just spending time on different sites and dashboards, that means you’ll be managing tricky issues — like inventory, demand, outbound packages and more — manually across a range of different (competing) websites. That’s basically a whole separate job in itself. Indeed, that’s what the founders of one new startup, Branch8, believe. With their service, they are aiming to make a difference and make selling across many sites something that any merchant can do with ease. Beyond consolidating the basic processes beyond selling via multiple services — Amazon, Lazada, Rakuten, eBay and Jumia are among the initial platforms supported — Branch8 also provides analytics to track traffic, it automates price checking and product migration, and connects to third-party logistics services. Those value-adds, Chan said, are where it believes it can really stand out for merchants. “Our differentiator is analytics,” he told TechCrunch in an interview. “Few tools track traffic via SKU. While our price tracking tool and the convenience of migrating to new platforms, this process is very manual, are specifically designed to meet merchants’ pain-points.” The service is initially free to use for three months, after which a subscription-based pricing model kicks in. Packages begin at $315 per month, rising to $715 for merchants with larger product ranges and more intensive customer service requirements.\\n\\nFacebook Now Sells Video Ads Inside Other Apps:\\xa0Facebook, which has ramped up its own video advertising efforts over the past two years, is now selling autoplay video ads inside apps it doesn’t own. Facebook had already been selling display ads this way. It has an ad network called Audience Network, which lets advertisers use your Facebook data to serve you ads inside other apps, like Candy Crush or Tango. An update to the product Tuesday included the option to buy new ad types, like video ads and carousel ads (you can swipe between multiple images). Video advertising is no longer a rarity. Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram all offer their own video ad products. But selling video ads through Audience Network is still an important update for Facebook, which makes the vast majority of its revenue from advertising. Video ads are more lucrative than traditional static or banner ads, which is why the social network has been pushing to sell them within its own apps.\\n\\n\\n')\n",
      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\nBig Changes at Google: Major Restructuring and a New Holding Company Named \\'Alphabet\\'; Shares Rise 6%:\\xa0Google is listening to Wall Street, while also trying to keep its innovation going. The Silicon Valley behemoth is reorganizing under a new name — Alphabet — and separating its moneymaking businesses from the moonshot ones. Under the new structure, Mr. Page is to run Alphabet along with Sergey Brin, who co-founded the web search business with him in 1998. Alphabet would be the parent entity, housing several companies, with the biggest among them Google. In addition, the portfolio would include Nest, the smart thermostat maker, and Calico, a company focused on longevity, among other things. Sundar Pichai, who had been senior vice president in charge of products, will be chief executive of Google, which will encompass Internet such products as search, maps, YouTube and applications like Gmail. Mr. Pichai will add YouTube to his list of products. The YouTube chief executive, Susan Wojcicki, will now report to him, whereas she previously reported to Mr. Page. In addition, Mr. Pichai will oversee the business operations for Google. Google’s current business chief, Omid Kordestani, will end that role and become an adviser to Alphabet and Google. Ruth Porat, chief financial officer of Google, will remain in that position and will also be chief financial officer for Alphabet. Other entities under Alphabet will include Google Fiber, a provider of ultrafast Internet service. There will also be two financial businesses, Google Ventures, the venture capital arm, and Capital, which does private-equity-like deals. Google X, which includes projects like self-driving cars, a drone delivery service and an attempt to make Internet-connected balloons, will be managed separately and run by Mr. Brin.A holding company structure also gives Mr. Page and Mr. Brin, who became multibillionaires when Google went public in 2004, room to make big new bets to add to Alphabet’s portfolio — without annoying Wall Street. Over the last few years, investors have expressed concern that Google has become distracted from its core web search, instead pursuing projects fancied by its founders, like self-driving cars or a pill to detect cancer. The holding-company structure is set to provide more financial transparency. Starting in the fourth quarter of this year, Alphabet will break out financial results for Google Inc., as well as for the overall company. While investors will not be able to see individual results for other companies, the system will make it easier to get a sense of how Google’s core business is doing.\\n\\nAfter Surprise drop in Exports, China Unexpectedly Weakens Yuan Reference Rate by Record 1.9% Amid Slowdown:\\xa0China weakened the yuan’s daily reference rate by a record 1.9 percent, allowing depreciation to combat a slump in exports. The currency dropped an unprecedented 1.2 percent to 6.2848 per dollar as of 9:43 a.m. in Shanghai, and slid a similar amount in Hong Kong’s offshore trading. The onshore spot rate was 0.9 percent weaker than the reference rate of 6.2298, within the 2 percent limit allowed by the People’s Bank of China. Monday’s reference rate increase was a one-time adjustment, the PBOC said in a statement, adding that it will strengthen the market’s role in the fixing and promote the convergence of the onshore and offshore rates. It said also that it will keep the yuan stable at a reasonable level. The yuan’s effective exchange rate is stronger than that of other currencies, which is a deviation from market expectations, the central bank said. The comments come after the PBOC said earlier Tuesday that a strong yuan puts pressure on exports. China’s overseas shipments fell 8.3 percent from a year earlier in dollar terms in July, well below the estimate for a 1.5 percent decline in a Bloomberg survey.\\n\\nFacebook Launches Autofill Forms, Improved Customer Service and Enhanced Video Analytics:\\xa0Autofill Forms: Overview: Facebook’s latest ads automatically populate contact information that people have previously given Facebook, like email addresses, phone numbers, address, company name, job title, etc. Details: Facebook has dubbed its new ad type as “lead ads” and hopes that their existence will make the mobile signup process easier. Lead ads take the friction out of the clunky experience associated with responding to mobile ads and filling out forms. Instead of leaving one app to start a form in another app and then entering all the information again from scratch, lead ads allow users to stay within their news feed. Retailer Opportunities: Removing clicks and manual data entry can greatly boost conversion rates for those brands advertising on Facebook. What You Should Know: Lead ads aren’t currently available to everyone. Facebook is testing them with a small group of businesses around the world to gain feedback before rolling them out to the wider public. Improved Customer Service. Overview: Facebook’s latest step toward enhancing customer service for pages is “saved replies” — a feature allowing page admins to write, save and reuse canned messages when they receive an inquiry via Facebook Messenger. Details: When responding to a message, saved replies appear in a list to the left. Simply click on your desired response from the list and it will automatically display in the message body and auto-populate with personalization features, such as the respondent’s name, admin’s name and company website. Retailer Opportunities: Customer service via social media is increasingly becoming more common. Why would consumers want to spend an extended amount of time waiting on the phone when they can quickly shoot the brand a message? This new feature will save businesses time when handling incoming customer service inquiries. Enhanced Video Analytics. Overview: Video metrics have been added to page insights. Details: On the new dedicated video tab, page admins can track total views, 30-second views, top videos and metrics for videos shared by other pages. In addition to customizing the date ranges, you can slice the data into various segments, such as organic versus paid, auto-played versus click-to-play and unique versus repeat.\\n\\nXiaomi Plans to Have India Smartphone Lineup Produced Locally (By FoxConn):\\xa0Foxconn has begun assembling Xiaomi’s first made-in-India smartphone from a new plant in the country’s south, helping the Chinese company shorten delivery times and prop up margins. Xiaomi, the world’s fourth-largest phone vendor, will source “100 percent” of Redmi 2 Prime devices sold in India from Foxconn’s new factory in Sri City, Hugo Barra, vice president of global operations, said by phone on Sunday. The Redmi 2 Prime went on sale online Monday, at $110 for a 2GB model. “We are starting small; but our eventual aim is to make most of our devices if not all of our devices that are sold in India, manufacture them here,” said Manu Jain, Xiaomi’s India head. “The entire ecosystem needs to exist before we start manufacturing the phone from scratch. This will probably take some time,” he said. Foxconn had begun production of smartphones at the Sri City factory, a person familiar with the matter said in July. The Taiwanese company, a contract manufacturer for the world’s largest electronics brands including Apple Inc., is looking to expand in the South Asian country amid Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Make in India campaign aimed at creating jobs and accelerating economic growth. Assembling locally will help Xiaomi shore up margins and take advantage of tax breaks in its largest market outside of China. As low-end smartphone sales slow in its home country, Xiaomi is depending on other emerging markets for growth.\\n\\nAlibaba to invest $4.6 billion in China electronics retailer Suning; JD.com falls 6% on news:\\xa0JD.com, a Chinese online retailer, sank to a four-month low after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s purchase of a stake in the country’s biggest electronics chain threatened to increase competition. The American depositary receipts plunged 6.3 percent to $30.06 in New York on Monday. Trading volume of 21.2 million ADRs was more than double the daily average of the past three months. JD.com, which gets more than half of its revenue from electronics and appliances, declined as most stocks on the Bloomberg China-U.S. Equity Index rose. JD.com slid after Alibaba, China’s biggest online retailer, said it will spend $4.6 billion to become Suning Commerce Group Ltd.’s second-largest shareholder with about a 20 percent stake. The ADRs extended their drop to 21 percent from this year’s high in June as concern mounted that stiffer competition will further slow sales growth in an industry already beset by the country’s slowest economic expansion in 25 years.\\n\\nTwitter Shares Climb 8% on NFL Deal, Executive Stock Purchases:\\xa0Twitter’s stock rose 8.2 percent on Monday after it unveiled a content deal with the National Football League and executives said they’re buying shares in the company. On Friday, the stock had closed at its lowest level since its November 2013 initial public offering, a slump that began in July when Jack Dorsey, co-founder and interim chief executive officer, warned that it will take a while before Twitter is able to reverse a slowdown in user growth. Today, Dorsey promoted his purchase of about $875,000 in shares with a tweet saying, “Investing in @twitter’s future.” Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto and board member Peter Fenton also bought Twitter shares last week, according to regulatory filings. It’s not the first time Twitter’s executives have coordinated their actions when confidence was low. Before reporting disappointing first-quarter sales, Twitter’s insiders halted all their sales for a few weeks.\\n\\nRackspace Pops 5% After Reporting Lackluster Q2 Results Buttressed By The Promise Of Share Buybacks:\\xa0Following the bell today, Rackspace reported its second-quarter financial performance. The company mostly missed street expectations, with lower-than-expected revenue, and earnings-per-share that just met expectations. Shares in the hosting company are up just under 6 percent in after-hours trading. Rackspace reported profit of $0.20 per share on revenue of $489 million in the three-month period. Investors had expected the company to report a $0.20 per-share profit on revenue of $490.54 million. The company grew its revenue 11 percent compared to the year-ago quarter; the company was quick to note that using a constant-currency basis for measurement, it grew 13.7 percent. If Rackspace missed on its top-line projections, and barely met its profit requirements as set by the street, why are its shares up? Because the firm is signalling a stock repurchase, of $500M in the next 6-9 months; Rackspace intends to borrow money to buy its own shares to reward shareholders with presents it can only slightly afford.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTaiwan\\'s Foxconn plans $5 billion investment over five years in Indian facility:\\xa0Taiwan\\'s Foxconn, the world\\'s largest contract electronics manufacturer and a key supplier to Apple, on Saturday signed a pact with India\\'s Maharashtra state to invest $5 billion over five years on a new electronics manufacturing facility. The announcement was made by Foxconn founder Terry Gou and Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis after the signing of an accord in the state capital Mumbai. The Foxconn announcement will bolster Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s \"Make in India\" campaign, which aims to turn Asia\\'s third-largest economy into a manufacturing powerhouse. Gou said Foxconn, the trade name for Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd which also counts Blackberry, Xiaomi and Amazon as clients, was looking for local partners for the facility in the western Indian state. He declined to say if the Taiwan-based company would make mobile phones at the facility. On Tuesday, Gou said in New Delhi that he was looking at setting up manufacturing units in various Indian states and possible partnerships in the world\\'s fastest growing smartphone market. He had said in May that Foxconn was aiming to develop 10-12 facilities in India, including factories and data centers, by 2020.\\n\\nInsight: Tesla burns cash, loses more than $4,000 on every car sold:\\xa0The Silicon Valley automaker is losing more than $4,000 on every Model S electric sedan it sells, using its reckoning of operating losses, and it burned $359 million in cash last quarter in a bull market for luxury vehicles. The company on Wednesday cut its production targets for this year and next. Chief Executive Elon Musk said he\\'s considering options to raise more capital, and didn\\'t rule out selling more stock. Musk has taken investors on a thrill ride since taking Tesla public in 2010. Now he\\'s given himself a deadline, promising that by the first quarter of 2016 Tesla will be making enough money to fund a jump from making one expensive, low volume car to mass producing multiple models, and expanding a venture to manufacture electric power storage systems. Tesla\\'s shares fell almost 9 percent on Thursday and slipped another 2 percent on Friday as investors and analysts weighed the risks of Musk\\'s ambitious plans for expanding Tesla\\'s auto and energy storage businesses. Tesla had just $1.15 billion on hand as of June 30, down from $2.67 billion a year earlier. Barclays analyst Brian Johnson disagreed with the company\\'s estimates, and said he expects Tesla\\'s capital spending will go up in 2016 and 2017 as the company ramps up its battery factory and Model 3 development. \"Their small scale means the cash generation is not as great as they might have hoped for,\" he said. Musk said this week Tesla expects to have $1 billion in cash over the next year, and told analysts \"there may be some value\" in raising capital \"as a risk reduction measure.\" Tesla\\'s stock is still about 70 percent higher than it was two years ago, and 8 percent ahead of its level on Jan 1. With a market capitalization of $31 billion, Tesla is worth more than Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, the much larger maker of Ram pickups and Jeep Grand Cherokees. \"A capital raise, given the way they\\'re burning cash today, given the fact that they have future investment needs, seems very likely at some point,\" said UBS Securities analyst Colin Langan, who has a sell rating on the stock.\\n\\nChina\\'s JD.com quarterly revenue tops estimates, third-quarter growth seen slowing:\\xa0JD.com Inc, China\\'s second-largest e-commerce site by sales, reported a 61 percent year-on-year rise in quarterly revenue, topping expectations, powered by a jump in the number of shoppers and goods bought on its platform. But the company\\'s growth rate is expected to slow in the third quarter. JD.com said it sees third-quarter revenue of between 43.2 and 44.7 billion yuan, which would be up 49 to 54 percent from the previous year. JD.com, a distant rival to Alibaba, is investing heavily in its offline operations to complement its internet platform, taking activities like warehousing and deliveries into its own hands. This business model, similar in style to Amazon.com\\'s, takes its toll and the company made a net loss of 510.4 million yuan, shrinking only slightly from the previous year\\'s 583 million despite the leap in revenue. The catalyst for that jump was the 118 million annual active customer accounts on JD.com in the 12 months ended June 30, up 72 percent from the same period a year earlier. Those customers drove an 82 percent jump in the total value of products sold on the company\\'s platforms in the quarter, to a total of 114.5 billion yuan. Shares in JD.com have risen 41.79 percent since the beginning of the year.\\n\\nRaising Money Is Like Buying Dinner, Spending Money Is Like Getting Fat: How A Big Round Can Hurt Your Startup:\\xa0When you’re a struggling team eating away at your meager savings and trying to get your startup profitable, venture capital funding seems like the holy grail. Raising money from investors gives you the resources to grow your team, buys you time to do things properly and gives you no small amount of credibility in the eyes of other entrepreneurs, prospective hires and even some clients — not to mention mom and dad thinking you’re now successful. While all of this is true, there’s a pervasive belief in the industry that entrepreneurs should aim to raise as much money as possible, as often as possible. It might be true in some circumstances, but here are three reasons why raising as much money as possible is often not in the best interest of the entrepreneur or the company. Raising Money Is Like Buying Dinner, Spending Money Is Like Getting Fat, and Raising Big Rounds Is Like Stunt Driving. In the end, it’s most important as an entrepreneur that you focus on the right decisions for your company. Don’t raise funds to get a big splash in the tech press. Don’t push for the biggest valuation to please preferred stockholders. And don’t optimize for the fanciest publications or the most street cred. All of those things are fleeting sugar highs of entrepreneurship. Plan for the long-term success of your company by knowing how much you actually need and stopping once you hit that number.\\n\\nHTC Trading Near Cash Leaves a Smartphone Brand - Once the leader in the US - With No Value:\\xa0A 56 percent plunge in HTC’s stock this year has brought its market value near to cash on hand. That means investors are effectively saying th smartphone maker’s brand, factories and buildings are almost worthless. At NT$52.2 billion ($1.6 billion), HTC’s market price is barely above the NT$47.2 billion cash it had at the end of June. A further 9.5 percent drop in its stock from the NT$63 close on Friday would bring the two figures into alignment, signaling investors put no value on the rest of the company. HTC’s fall from a market capitalization of more than NT$900 billion in 2011 charts the perils of a product and marketing strategy that’s failed in the face of stiffer competition from Samsung Electronics and Huawei Technologies. Once the best-selling brand in the U.S., the failure of its One, Butterfly and Desire smartphones to drive sales has pushed HTC outside a global top-10 now dominated by Chinese brands. Its forecast for third-quarter sales of as much as 48 percent below analyst estimates follows a 35 percent cut to projected revenue in the preceding period and indicates that the Taoyuan, Taiwan-based company has little chance of regaining market share in the short-term. “HTC’s cash is the only asset of value to shareholders,” said Calvin Huang, who has a NT$46.50 price target on the stock at Sinopac Financial Holdings Co. in Taipei. “Most of the other assets shouldn’t be considered in their valuation because there’s more write-offs to come and the brand has no value.”\\n\\nAs private and public multiples diverge sharply, some investors bet on public companies\\xa0:\\xa0Airbnb’s valuation has ballooned over the last few years as large financial firms like Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price have rushed to invest in the start-up. But a small San Francisco-based hedge fund called Pier 88 Investment Partners has decided that the fervor for Airbnb shares creates a different kind of opportunity. While other investors paid dearly to buy a piece of Airbnb — the start-up’s latest funding round valued it at $24 billion — Pier 88 did not invest directly in the privately held online home-rental company. Instead, Pier 88 put money into HomeAway, a publicly traded Internet company that competes with Airbnb, but has a market capitalization of just $2.95 billion. Frank Timons and LeAnne Schweitzer, the co-founders of Pier 88, believe there is money to be made on this big gap between public and private company valuations. In their view, the public companies are such relative bargains that they will make great acquisitions for purchasers that want to better compete with upstarts like Airbnb. Then, when those publicly traded companies are snapped up — often for a premium of more than 50 percent — Pier 88 can profit from the bet. Some elite start-ups are now vastly more expensive than their publicly traded cousins. Apart from Airbnb being pegged at eight times the value of HomeAway, the ride-hailing start-up Uber was recently valued at around $51 billion, compared with $7.3 billion for the rental-car company Hertz. The storage start-up Dropbox has a valuation of around $10 billion, while its publicly traded rival Box has a $1.9 billion market capitalization. It’s not perfectly accurate to directly compare market capitalization and private company valuations, since private companies keep their true financial pictures hidden. Still, “the easy private financing environment has created an interesting trade opportunity,” said Kenneth J. Heinz, the president of Hedge Fund Research, which tracks hedge funds and their performance. “With such a disparity between public and private multiples, it’s a reasonable fundamental approach to believe that in this environment, the public company valuation will come up or the company will be acquired.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInMobi ties up with Amazon and Paytm for India launch of discovery-led mobile commerce platform:\\xa0SoftBank-backed mobile ad technology company InMobi Pte Ltd has joined hands with Amazon India, mobile wallet Paytm and others for the India launch of Miip, its new platform for discovery-led mobile commerce. Miip, which has an animated green monkey as mascot, engages users by suggesting products to buy across apps. It was launched in the US three weeks ago. InMobi, which competes with Facebook and Google for a pie of burgeoning mobile advertising market, will launch Miip in China on August 18. Naveen Tewari, founder and CEO of InMobi said Miip will aid “serendipitous discovery” of products across thousands of mobile apps. “Today merchants have tough time getting users to discover and explore their products. Miip will create personalised shopping experiences to enable discovery of products from more merchants,” he said. The company has forged a partnership with Amazon.in to initiate a pilot on the Miip platform. Kishore Thotta, head of digital marketing, Amazon India said platforms such as InMobi’s Miip will facilitate cross-app shopping experiences. Miip will facilitate seamless payment and checkouts within the discovery sessions through the “Buy with Paytm” button. Miip will soon be launched in beta version with several partners across e-commerce and app developers such as Magzter, Moneyview, Nestaway, Shopclues, Swiggy, Urban Ladder, Vozpop, Wooplr and Zimmber.\\n\\nPracto raises $90M from China’s Tencent, Sofina, Google Capital, Yuri Milner, others:\\xa0Practo, a web-based clinic management software developer and medicare listings provider, has raised $90 million in Series C funding led by Chinese media and technology conglomerate Tencent Holdings. Marquee institutional investors such as Sofina, Sequoia India, Google Capital, Altimeter Capital, Matrix Partners, Sequoia Capital Global Equities and Russian investor Yuri Milner also put money in this round, as per a press statement. Practo will use the money to expand product lines, acquire more startups and enhance headcount. “We are hard at work building a single health app that helps people live healthier by making better healthcare decisions for themselves and their loved ones. We are excited to partner with some of the best investors on the planet. Our global partners will give us the edge to continue building global healthcare products that our users love,” said Shashank ND, founder and CEO of Practo. A few months ago, Practo had raised $30 million in Series B round from Sequoia India and Matrix Partners. Three years ago, it had raised $4.6 million from Sequoia Capital in Series A funding. Recently, Practo acquired product outsourcing firm Genii Technologies Pvt Ltd for its capabilities in building bespoke e-commerce portals and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platforms. Practo offers services like helping patients find relevant doctors online, compare them and schedule appointments. It also sells PractoRay under a SaaS model for primary clinics, which enables doctors to schedule and manage patient records. Practo already lists over 8,000 hospitals on its platform and will expand this to over 20,000 by end of this year. Recently, it launched a new feature that allows users to find diagnostic labs in their vicinity. It competes with the likes of Lybrate, HelpingDoc, Praxify and AllizHealth.\\n\\nTesla Plunges 9% as Musk Grapples With SUV’s Second-Row Seats:\\xa0Elon Musk can’t make an SUV without seats. Tesla’s chief executive officer dialed back his forecast for 2015 vehicle deliveries, saying that getting the new sport utility vehicle’s middle-row seats just right is proving thornier than expected. The added threat of not having enough of other interior parts puts the original sales plan at risk, he said. “Our biggest challenges are with the second-row seat,” Musk said Wednesday during a conference call with analysts. “It’s an amazing seat, a sculptural work of art, but a very tricky thing to get right.” He added that some interior trim components could become roadblocks, but the so-called falcon-wing doors weren’t going to be a problem. Assembly snags on the Model X, Tesla Motors Inc.’s first SUV, could also slow output of the Model S sedan, Musk said. So now the company may deliver 50,000 to 55,000 autos in 2015, down from an initial target of 55,000. Tesla shares fell 8.9 percent to $246.13 at the close Thursday after plunging as much as 13 percent for the biggest intraday decline in 21 months. While lowering the bar for this year and next, Musk said he remains “confident” that Tesla will produce about half a million cars in 2020. He’s said that’s when investors should be able to expect the company to become profitable. Musk pointed out Tesla made 600 cars annually five years ago. “Now we can produce 600 cars in three days,” he said. As production of the SUV increases, the company will become free cash-flow positive, probably near the end of this year and “certainly” for the first quarter of 2016, Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja said. Tesla has drawn down $50 million of a $750 million credit line, and left open the possibility of going to Wall Street for additional money.\\n\\nApple Music attracts more than 11 million trial members:\\xa0Apple said on Thursday its new music streaming service has attracted more than 11 million members during its free trial period, a response that music industry experts called respectable but not overwhelming. Apple Music rolled out with a three-month free trial period on June 30. Nearly 2 million people opted for the free trial family plan, which will cost $14.99 a month for up to six family members, the company said. The service costs $9.99 a month for individuals. Apple’s iTunes Store helped revitalize the music industry a decade ago, but digital downloads have slumped in recent years amid a shift toward streaming. Unlike popular streaming services from rivals such as Spotify, Apple’s offering does not include a free on-demand tier, a decision praised by some in the music industry. Apple shares were down 4 cents at $114.84 in early afternoon. Based on typical conversion rates in the industry, it would be impressive if Apple convinced 20 percent of the trial members to become paying subscribers after the free trial ends, he added. Spotify has more than 20 million paid subscribers worldwide, the company has told Reuters.\\n\\nHTC Plummets to Decade Low on Loss Forecast Five Times Estimates:\\xa0HTC Corp. plunged by the daily limit after its forecast for a quarterly loss five times greater than estimates spurred analysts to slash their valuations of the stock. Shares dropped 10 percent to NT$63 in Taipei on Friday, heading for their lowest price in more than a decade. The smartphone maker’s third-quarter loss will be NT$5.51 to NT$5.85 per share, compared with expectations for a loss of NT$1.17 per share. Its sales forecast given Thursday is as much as 48 percent below estimates. HTC plans to cut staff, reduce spending and slim down its product catalog as cheaper phones from Huawei Technologies Co. and competition from Samsung Electronics Co. further erode its market share. Founder, Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer Cher Wang has stated she won’t consider mergers, even as the company fell off the global list of top 10 phonemakers. Sales this quarter will be NT$19 billion ($600 million) to NT$22 billion, the company said, compared with estimates for NT$36.8 billion. Revenue at the bottom end of that range would be the lowest in a decade when figures were reported at the parent level. HTC will change its product strategy to produce fewer models over longer time intervals while focusing on a greater share of industry profits instead of shipments, Chief Financial Officer Chang Chialin said Thursday. Cost reductions will start this quarter, with the result of those cuts being shown in the first quarter, he said.\\n\\nNvidia\\'s gaming, auto chips drive surprise rise in revenue; Shares rise 10%:\\xa0Nvidia reported a surprise rise in second-quarter revenue and gave a better-than-expected revenue forecast for the current quarter, helped by strong demand for its graphic chips used in gaming and cars. The company\\'s shares rose nearly 10 percent in extended trading on Thursday. Nvidia\\'s revenue increased 4.5 percent in the quarter ended July 26 to $1.15 billion , while analysts on average were expecting revenue to decrease about 8 percent. Nvidia gets a majority of its revenue from its graphic chips made for personal computers, and there were fears that the fall in PC sales would hurt Nvidia just like it has Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. But, Nvidia said gaming revenue rose 59 percent, helped by strong sales of its popular GeForce series of gaming chips. Nvidia has also been increasing its focus on making chips that allows people to play graphics-heavy games over the internet and chips used in a car\\'s dashboard display and in self-driving cars. Automotive revenue rose 76 percent in the quarter and accounted for only 6.2 percent of total revenue. The company said 8 million cars on the road were using its chips and that it was working with more than 50 companies for its DRIVE chip for self-driving cars. However, revenue in Nvidia\\'s enterprise business fell 14 percent. The business, which makes chips used for software such as AutoCAD, accounted for 16.2 percent of total revenue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook launches feature to allow businesses to privately message users:\\xa0Facebook rolled out features Wednesday that enable businesses to privately communicate with customers through messages as part of the social networking company\\'s push to make its Messenger app a stand-alone platform. Businesses can now include a \"send message\" button in ads that appear in Newsfeed that allow Facebook users to click a button and send messages, which are private. If users post a comment on a business\\' Facebook page, then the business can privately message that person The features are part of Facebook\\'s efforts to convince more small and medium-sized businesses - especially those in emerging markets, such as India, Brazil and Indonesia - to advertise on its platform. By giving them direct access to customers, the world\\'s largest social network hopes to show that advertising on Facebook directly leads to increased sales. To encourage quick responses, Facebook will award \"very responsive to messages\" badges on business pages that respond to 90 percent of messages and respond on average within five minutes. People will, however, still be able to block private messages from businesses. The features will be especially valuable in southeast Asia, Facebook wrote in a blog post. About twice as many Thai and Singaporean users use Facebook messages to communicate with businesses each month and most Southeast Asia users follow some company pages.\\n\\nTwitter Will Offer ‘Buy’ Buttons to as Many as 100,000 Merchants With New Shopify Deal:\\xa0The social network is in the process of integrating with Shopify and other e-commerce software companies to offer its Buy buttons to a much wider range of businesses, big and small, according to multiple sources. Shopify alone has somewhere around 100,000 merchants in the U.S. that use its software to run their online shops. With a Twitter deal, those businesses would be able to sell their wares within tweets using Shopify’s software. Twitter, Facebook and Pinterest have all been adding Buy buttons to their platforms over the last year, as they try to build new revenue streams from their giant audiences and take advantage of people’s interest in buying items through their platforms. But since those three giants don’t — or can’t — integrate directly with every business that wants to sell goods on their platforms, they are turning to companies like Shopify to help. Pinterest is working with Shopify as well as Demandware, which runs online shops for some bigger brands and retailers like Michael’s and Cole Haan. Facebook, too, is working exclusively with Shopify merchants in the beta tests for its own Buy button. When Twitter’s Buy button initiative first launched last year, the company was working with smaller e-commerce software providers like Fancy and Gumroad. So a deal with Shopify at this point has essentially become table stakes for these platforms. But it certainly does not guarantee success. It’s not proven that people want to shop on these social platforms, nor that all these merchants want to sell on social media platforms. And small merchants without strong followings on these networks may have to turn to advertisements to promote their products more broadly.\\n\\nGoDaddy forecasts current-quarter revenue below estimates:\\xa0Web-hosting company GoDaddy Inc forecast current-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates after a comfortable beat, sending its shares down 5 percent in after-market trading. GoDaddy on Wednesday forecast revenue in the range of $405 million-$410 million for the third quarter ending September 30. The company, which manages about 60 million Internet domains, or about a fifth of the world\\'s total, has been investing heavily to expand into new markets. GoDaddy\\'s revenue rose 16.5 percent to $394.5 million, beating the average analyst estimate of $392.9 million. Total costs and operating expenses rose 20 percent to $428.1 million. General and administrative expenses included about $30 million in IPO-related costs, Wagner said. GoDaddy had a blockbuster debut on April 1, with investors snapping up its shares betting that the company can grow further by providing tools to small businesses. The net loss attributable to the company narrowed to $29.8 million from $37.6 million. GoDaddy\\'s shares closed at $29.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. The shares had risen about 47 percent since the market debut.\\n\\nTesla Falls on Sales Target Cut to as Few as 50,000 Vehicles:\\xa0Tesla Motors fell in extended trading after the electric-car maker backed off its full-year vehicle sales forecast. Tesla said it now aims to deliver 50,000 to 55,000 vehicles this year, compared with a previous target of 55,000. The company sees third-quarter production and deliveries of just more than 12,000 vehicles including just a few Model X sport utility vehicles. Reaching the initial target may be a stretch because some interior suppliers might not be able to increase the flow of high-quality parts fast enough to meet the Model X production plan, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said on a conference call with analysts. Because the SUV and the existing Model S share the same assembly line, a shortfall by one Model X supplier could slow output of both vehicles. Tesla stock fell 5.8 percent after tumbling as much as 9.3 percent following regular trading. Tesla had gained 21 percent this year through Wednesday’s close, outpacing the 2.4 percent increase by the Russell 1000 Index. Some analysts had been skeptical about Tesla’s plans to increase deliveries by 74 percent this year, especially with so much of the increase coming late in the year.\\n\\nFitbit Declines on Margin Concerns in First Post-IPO Report:\\xa0Fitbit shares dropped as much as 16 percent in late trading after the company, which makes wearable fitness trackers, posted narrower margins in its first earnings report following an initial public offering. Second-quarter gross margin, a measure of profitability, narrowed to 47 percent in the second quarter from 51 percent a year earlier. Revenue more than tripled to $400.4 million, and profit before certain items was 21 cents a share, San Francisco-based Fitbit said Wednesday in a statement. The company, which dominates the market for fitness bands that monitor health data such as activity and sleep patterns, said it sold 4.5 million devices in the quarter. Costs to boost manufacturing capacity as well as slimmer profits on fast-selling newer products led to the gross margin decline, said Dougherty analyst Charles Anderson. Fitbit shares slipped as low as $43.25 following the report, after initially jumping as high as $56.48. They rose 3.9 percent to $51.64 at the close in New York. The company went public on June 17 at $20 a share. “This is a stock that had reached nosebleed levels,” he said. “But it’s hard to argue with a company that’s growing 250 percent.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Denies Planning to Sell Mobile Services Directly to Consumers:\\xa0Apple, the world’s most profitable mobile phone maker, has denied a report that it is working on a plan to market communications services directly to consumers that would bypass telecom operators on which it now relies. Business Insider on Monday reported that the iPhone maker was testing a so-called mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) service in the United States, which would involve it renting capacity from one or more network operators to sign up its own customers. The mobile phone maker is also in talks with European operators about such an arrangement, the website reported. “We have not discussed nor do we have any plans to launch an MVNO,” said an Apple spokeswoman in a statement on Tuesday.\\n\\nFacebook Mobile App Advertisers Won\\'t Lose Their Device-Level Data After All As Social giant switches gears:\\xa0Facebook said three months ago it planned to take away mobile app-install advertisers\\' ability to collect device-level data. But money talks, and ad-buying marketers evidently protested enough for the social media giant to reverse course. The Menlo Park, California-based company said in an email statement: \"We advise our advertisers to apply people-based measurement solutions so they can determine when they\\'re reaching multiple people, not just multiple devices. While we believe device-level reporting is not the most accurate way to properly determine advertising effectiveness, we want to provide advertisers with the choice to measure ads based on what is important to them. In order to provide that choice, we will continue giving advertisers the option to receive device-level reporting from our mobile measurement partners for mobile app ads.\" For nearly two years, Facebook has allowed app-install marketers to grab information that helped them determine—among other things—how their ads performed on devices such as iPhones, Samsung Galaxies and HTC Ones. Advertisers have to agree to keep that device-level data to themselves, as Facebook wants brands to focus on other metrics and is wary of privacy concerns. When Facebook revealed to marketers its plans to cut off such data while making them focus on campaign-based statistical results, they pushed back, according to a VentureBeat story last month.\\n\\nHackers Exploit ‘Flash’ Vulnerability in Yahoo Ads:\\xa0For seven days, hackers used Yahoo’s ad network to send malicious bits of code to computers that visit Yahoo’s collection of heavily trafficked websites, the company said on Monday. The attack, which started on July 28, was the latest in a string that have exploited Internet advertising networks, which are designed to reach millions of people online. It also highlighted growing anxiety over a much-used graphics program called Adobe Flash, which has a history of security issues that have irked developers at Silicon Valley companies. “Right now, the bad guys are really enjoying this,” said Jérôme Segura, a security researcher at Malwarebytes, the security company that uncovered the attack. “Flash for them was a godsend.” The scheme, which Yahoo shut down on Monday, worked like this: A group of hackers bought ads across the Internet giant’s sports, news and finance sites. When a computer — in this case, one running Windows — visited a Yahoo site, it downloaded malware code. From there, the malware hunted for an out-of-date version of Adobe Flash, which it could use to commandeer the computer — either holding it for ransom until the hackers were paid off or discreetly directing its browser to websites that paid the hackers for traffic.\\n\\nCrafts website operator Etsy\\'s loss doubles; shares tumble:\\xa0Crafts shopping website operator Etsy\\'s quarterly loss doubled due to higher marketing expenses and the company said these costs would only increase in the current quarter. Etsy\\'s shares fell more than 15 percent to $16.27 in after-hours trading on Tuesday. The company\\'s marketing costs jumped 77 percent in the second quarter ended June 30 due in part due to higher spending on product listing ads. Total costs rose 49.3 percent. Etsy said it plans to spend more on marketing in absolute dollars in the third quarter than it did in the second quarter or the year-earlier quarter. It also said it expects to increase the pace of hiring in the current quarter compared with both the second quarter and the year-earlier quarter. The company said the strengthening dollar could hurt demand for dollar-denominated goods in the current quarter, which could slow the pace of growth of gross merchandise sales. Gross merchandise sales, a measure of total value of goods sold, rose 24.6 percent in the second quarter, driven by a 24.6 percent growth in active sellers and a 31.6 percent jump in active buyers on Etsy\\'s website. Revenue rose 44.4 pct to $61.4 million in the quarter.\\n\\nApple\\'s momentum \\'meltdown\\' bites investors:\\xa0Has the \"curse of the Dow\" finally caught up with Apple? Shares of the iPhone maker have been in a rut since posting disappointing quarterly results in late June, falling to a six-month low of $113.25 on Tuesday. The recent declines have wiped out nearly $100 billion of Apple\\'s market value - about as much as fellow Dow components Boeing and McDonald\\'s are worth in total. For CEO Tim Cook, it means his stake of more than 111 million shares is now worth about $12.76 billion, compared with nearly $15 billion at the peak in late April. The dropoff represents a notable bout of weakness for a stock basically impervious to pain for the better part of two years. Strategists pinned the sell-off on the steady run in the shares, as the stock has gained more than 137 percent since hitting a low in April of 2013. In addition, more than 5,700 different funds already own the shares, according to Morningstar data. With Tuesday\\'s declines, the shares have dropped 13 percent over the last 11 trading days. \"When you get a stock that is over-owned it’s difficult to find that incremental buyer,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. \"It’s having its own momentum meltdown.\"\\n\\nApple Doing Own Cellular Service Doesn’t Make Sense, at Least Not Today:\\xa0The appeal is tempting, of course. Apple would then fully own the relationship with the customer rather than leaving that job to one of the “orifices,” as Steve Jobs famously labeled the wireless providers. Google is in fact doing just this with its Google Fi effort, where it offers service starting at $20 per month using the networks of both Sprint and T-Mobile. But the service is fairly limited. It’s offered only on a single Nexus 6 phone and its designed to keep the service more of a test than a true national rival. It doesn’t make sense for Apple for a number of reasons. First it has a tough time doing things small — Apple currently represents a huge part of the carriers’ business, and some of the carriers’ most lucrative customers are its iPhone owners. So the carriers aren’t going to be eager to hand that over to Apple. Even if Apple could convince them to do so, it might not be in Apple’s long-term interest. First of all, consumers today are benefitting from four carriers heavily competing against one another, with a resurgent T-Mobile and an increasingly desperate Sprint both putting price pressure on AT&T and Verizon. Also, carriers spend a fortune to keep their networks strong enough to handle increasing demands and to swiftly upgrade to faster technologies. If they become truly a dumb pipe just selling gigabytes to Apple, the incentive to differentiate on customer service or speed is reduced, as would be the amount of capital they would have to invest. Over time, that could mean both Apple and consumers would lose. Plus, if it is Apple’s name attached to the service, it would have to take on the role of customer support and the perceived blame when the service doesn’t meet customer expectations. “That’s a lot to bite off, and I can’t see Apple wanting to do it,” said Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson. Now, that doesn’t mean Apple isn’t interested in seeing more value come to it over time. With iMessage, for example, Apple took something that consumers value — their text messages — and made it a feature of their phone rather than something tied to their carrier and phone number. There are reports Apple would like to do the same thing with voicemail. Apple also introduced on the latest iPads a SIM card that works across different cellular networks so customers don’t have to choose a carrier when choosing a device. Apple could do something similar with the next iPhone. These moves make sense. Whether Apple has dreams of eventually offering cell service or not, it is to their advantage that consumers are more tied to their iPhone than they are to being a customer of AT & T or T-Mobile. Do such moves also open the door to Apple offering its own cell service some day? Sure. And it would be foolish for Apple not to constantly consider whether such a move makes sense. But, at least for now, the downsides likely outweigh the benefits.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Employees Flee Twitter and Shares Continue to Slump; Drop to Lowest Since IPO May Lure Takeover Offers:\\xa0Shares slumped 5.6 percent on Monday to $29.27, the lowest price since the company’s November 2013 initial public offering. The move pushed Twitter below $20 billion in market value, making it more attractive to potential acquirers like Google, investors said. Last week, Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s interim chief executive officer and co-founder, and Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto warned that it will be a while before the social media company stems a slowdown in user growth. They also noted that demand from advertisers missed their expectations. Meanwhile, Twitter is conducting a search to replace former CEO Dick Costolo. “Their comments could be suppressing the stock price for a reason, because their strategy is to be acquired,” said Jeff Sica, president of Sica Wealth Management, who has clients who hold Twitter. “I’m advising anyone that owns Twitter to hold, because I do think at this point there’s going to be an acquisition.” Even at these levels, Twitter with a small premium would probably be the largest acquisition ever for Google or Facebook Inc. Facebook last year acquired WhatsApp Inc., a messaging application, for $22 billion. Twitter has been increasing its ties with Google, making a deal earlier this year to display tweets in search results and partnering with Google’s Doubleclick ad product. Twitter’s price would have to drop to $11.16 a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For Facebook’s earnings to benefit, Twitter shares would only need to drop to $20.78. Competitors are looking at some of Twitter’s assets: its employees. Two product executives announced their departures on July 28, the same day the company reported earnings. Todd Jackson, who helped Twitter debut its Highlights product, left for Dropbox Inc., while Christian Oestlien, who helped drive growth, is going to Google’s YouTube. Trevor O’Brien, also in product leadership, announced his departure a few days later. Without a clear path to a leader who can help Twitter accelerate user growth, “the only strategy that will work for them is if they’re acquired”.\\n\\nAlibaba Declines as Chinese ADRs Retreat on Economic Slowdown; Down 35% from Post-IPO High:\\xa0Alibaba, China’s biggest online retailer, slid for an eighth day as fresh data highlighting China’s weakening economy stoked concern that the company’s sales growth is slowing. The American depositary receipts retreated 0.4 percent to $77.99 in New York on Monday, capping the longest slump since the company’s September debut. The drop pushed Alibaba’s decline from its high in November to 35 percent. Alibaba sold ADRs for $68 apiece in a record $25 billion initial public offering on Sept. 18. They had climbed as much as 75 percent in the following two months to a record high of $119.15 in November. The company will probably report a 34 percent increase in sales for the June quarter, down from 46 percent in the same period last year, according to the average estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. LightInTheBox, a web-based retailer of China-made goods to overseas markets, tumbled 9.3 percent to $3.63, the lowest since its U.S. listing in June 2013. Jumei International, which sells beauty products online, sank 6.7 percent to $17.46, dropping the most in four weeks.\\n\\nApple Falls Below Its 200-Day Moving Average for First Time Since 2013:\\xa0The bull market’s base just lost another brick. Amid a collapse in breadth and the threat of falling earnings, add a correction in Apple shares to the concerns facing investors. The iPhone maker slipped 2.4 percent to $118.44 today, extending its decline since February to 11 percent and dropping below another chart threshold, its 200-day moving average, for the first time since 2013. The iPhone maker’s shares had spent 471 sessions above the 200-day threshold, last falling below it in September 2013. It entered a correction territory today after coming within 40 cents of one on July 9 before rallying.\\n\\nFor Mobile Messaging, GIFs Prove to Be Worth at Least a Thousand Words:\\xa0Just as smartphones drove the rise of emoji, mobile devices are propelling GIFs into a more widespread form of instant visual-messaging. Tumblr, the blogging site, said it had 23 million GIFs posted to its site every day. In March, Facebook began supporting GIFs, with more than five million of the animations sent daily through its messaging app. Slack, the workplace collaboration start-up, says it counts more than two million GIF integrations each month. In total, online searches for GIFs have risen by a factor of nine since mid-2012, according to Experian Marketing Services, an industry research firm. While the brief animations are not new — GIFs were created in 1987 by Steve Wilhite, a programmer at CompuServe, and have been omnipresent on desktops — major improvements in mobile technology and a surge of messaging applications are pushing GIFs to break out beyond the web forums of old. They have become a mainstream form of digital expression, a way to relay complex feelings and thoughts in ways beyond words and even photographs, making them hugely popular with young audiences who never leave home without their smartphones. The animated snippets are being spread on mobile devices by a new generation of GIF start-ups, which are backed by venture capital. Riffsy, which makes the GIF keyboard for smartphones, just raised $10 million. Giphy, which provides a search engine for a vast library of GIFs, has raised more than $23 million. And there are numerous other companies, like Imgur, PopKey and Kanvas, all eager to snip and remix video clips into short, ready-to-share packages. For now, few of these companies are profiting from GIFs as they focus on propagating the use of the clips. But the start-ups see potential for profit, especially as brands increasingly integrate the animations into advertising and other marketing. GIFs are marked by certain characteristics. They are typically a few seconds long, soundless and play in a loop. They are often culled from movie and TV clips and can include text on top of the animated image. Their use has seeped into professional venues, frequently replacing text. Google recently sent a reporter a GIF of a toddler throwing her hands up in response to a question. Digital publications like BuzzFeed regularly use GIFs as a storytelling method. And office workers like Jerrod Howlett, an employee at Google, regularly respond to email with GIFs. “I’m not that great with words,” Mr. Howlett said. “But if I find the perfect GIF, it nails it.”\\n\\nGerman Carmakers Buy Nokia’s Here Mapping Unit for $3 Billion:\\xa0Nokia said that it had sold its Here digital mapping unit to a consortium of German automakers for 2.8 billion euros, or about $3 billion. The announcement signals the latest chapter in Nokia’s transformation, as the company tries to rebound from the demise of its once world-leading mobile phone unit, which was sold to Microsoft last year for about $7.6 billion. As part of the changes, the Finnish company has pared its operations to focus almost entirely on its telecom network infrastructure business, which provides communications equipment to some of the world’s largest carriers. The members of the German consortium said that they would use Nokia’s digital mapping unit for their own autonomous driving plans, but that they would be willing to license the technology to other companies. The sale of Nokia’s mapping unit comes as the Finnish company is close to completing its $16.6 billion acquisition of the French-American telecom equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia has received regulatory approval from United States and European antitrust authorities for that deal, but it is still waiting for the go-ahead from Chinese officials. By agreeing to a sale price of roughly $3 billion, the Finnish company is essentially writing off years of research and development, and a series of multibillion acquisitions that had turned Here into a global mapping champion. Those deals include the $8.1 billion purchase in 2007 of Navteq, the maker of digital mapping and navigational software based in Chicago, as Nokia tried to keep pace with other handset makers and mobile operating systems. As digital maps are becoming a crucial focal point of many emerging industries, a number of bidders had expressed interest in Here, including the ride-booking service Uber, which submitted a $3 billion bid for the business before dropping out last month. Other tech giants, including Amazon, the Chinese search engine Baidu and Facebook, also rely on Nokia’s geospatial data for their mapping services. These companies had turned to Here to reduce their reliance on Google — a company that they increasingly compete with for users, engineers and advertising revenue. It will now be up to the German automakers to convince these tech companies that they can continue to offer the same level of digital mapping services that had made Nokia’s unit the main global rival to Google Maps.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft Said to Invest Big Sum in Uber; Latest Round Values Firm at $51 Billion:\\xa0Microsoft has agreed to invest in Uber, according to people with knowledge of the matter, as part of a funding round that values the ride-hailing company at around $51 billion. If the deal is finalized, Microsoft’s contribution would be a substantial amount of the financing, which totals about $1 billion, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details of the fund-raising are not public. This new round cements Uber’s place as one of the most richly valued private companies ever, along with other start-ups like Xiaomi, the Chinese electronics company valued by investors at around $45 billion, and Airbnb, the short-term lodging service valued at more than $24 billion. It is also the latest fund-raising spree undertaken by Uber, which has added billions of dollars to its surging war chest. Uber has earmarked significant money for expansion into new markets like China, India and greater Southeast Asia. On Thursday, an Uber representative said the company had set aside $1 billion to spur growth specifically in India, where the company has faced stiff competition from local ride-hailing services. Uber has a history of bringing in important partners during funding rounds. In December, Baidu, the Chinese search giant, invested hundreds of millions in Uber. And in March, Times Internet, the digital venture of the Times of India Group media conglomerate, said it had agreed to a strategic investment in Uber.\\n\\nGoogle, Amazon Show Investors Cost Control Is Key for Tech:\\xa0Investors have started to reward Internet companies that can show both financial discipline and a path to long-term growth, making Amazon and Google the clear winners of the technology earnings season. Google kept costs in check in the second quarter, and shareholders cheered with a 16 percent stock gain after the search giant released better-than-expected results. Amazon also surged after posting a surprise profit, demonstrating that the Web retailer is capable of making money when it puts a brake on spending. By contrast, Facebook , which vowed to keep its brisk pace of investments to lure users and advertisers, fell as Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg was short on details about money-making plans for the company’s newer initiatives, like WhatsApp and Oculus. LinkedIn and Twitter slumped over concerns that user growth is slowing. Microsoft Corp. posted its largest-ever quarterly loss. And Apple failed to meet analysts’ predictions for iPhone sales and growth for the current quarter.\\n\\nIndia’s Snapdeal, an Amazon Competitor, Raises $500 Million From Alibaba, Foxconn and SoftBank:\\xa0Alibaba finally has its ally in India, perhaps the world’s hottest e-commerce market. The Chinese e-commerce giant has invested in Snapdeal, an India-based e-commerce startup, as part of a $500 million round, according to multiple sources. Foxconn, the Taiwanese company best known as a manufacturer of Apple’s iPhones, also invested, alongside existing Snapdeal investor SoftBank. Snapdeal had previously raised more than $1 billion from investors including SoftBank, eBay, BlackRock, Bessemer Ventures and Indian venture firms such as Kalaari Capital and Nexus Venture Partners. Alibaba and Foxconn were considering the investment earlier this year, which would value Snapdeal at $5 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported in June. The company has undergone several iterations since Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal founded it in 2010, including one as a Groupon clone. Today, it’s an online shopping marketplace that sells a wide range of products, from cameras to jeans to toys — pitting it against Flipkart, a homegrown competitor currently valued at around $15 billion, and Amazon, which is investing billions of dollars into its Indian business. In the past year, Snapdeal has started to develop an ecosystem of sites by acquiring companies focused on different areas of online commerce. It bought FreeCharge, a popular service in India that allows people to add money to prepaid phone plans and prepaid TV plans. It also acquired RupeePower, a comparison shopping site for credit cards and loans. The approach is not all that different from Alibaba’s, which runs a host of different marketplaces focused on different types of buyers and different regions. While Flipkart has more market share in India, Snapdeal CEO Bahl thinks that company and Amazon are thinking too narrowly by being focused mainly on the sale of physical products, he told Re/code during an interview at Snapdeal’s Indian headquarters in April. Snapdeal, on the other hand, is going after what Bahl believes will eventually be a $250 billion opportunity — bringing all kinds of other transactions online in addition to the sale of products. “What’s the delta between retail and consumption?” Bahl asked rhetorically, referring to the difference between the two. “It’s things like financial services, education, utilities, health care. But today, all everyone is doing is products.” “Others are building aircraft carriers,” he added. “We are building an army of speedboats.”\\n\\nWhy Some Start-Ups Are Called Tech Companies and Others Are Not:\\xa0these days, every company is at least a little bit of a tech company. Some Wall Street banks employ more tech workers than all but the biggest Silicon Valley companies. And large manufacturers like General Electric are leading the way in efforts to put Internet-connected sensors on things as varied as streets and turbines. So why then are some start-ups called tech companies and others just … companies? “Tech means more than just producing hardware or software,” said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “It is synonymous with innovation, research and development, long-term thinking.” The label is a signal that “you want to work for me. You want to buy things from me at a higher price. You want to give me capital at a lower cost,” Mr. Zandi said. It is difficult to say what the financial windfall of the tech label is to today’s start-ups since most of them are still private companies, though no doubt they benefit from being close to the tech industry’s deep-pocketed financiers. But toward the end of the dot-com boom at the turn of the century, Raghavendra Rau, now a professor of finance at the University of Cambridge Judge Business School, was the co-author of a study that documented the temporary surge in the stock prices of companies that added the dot-com suffix to their names. Those temporary dot-coms took advantage of an investor behavior called “categorization,” said Mr. Rau. Categorization helps us understand something if we’re not familiar with it. “We build up a story in our heads on what we think we are going to see,” he said. “Even if the firm has no cash flows or no profits, we think we know what the story is. And firms are good at seeing what is popular and trying to fit in with that mental map.” Today’s happy adopters of the tech label, however, should note the follow-up research by Mr. Rau and his co-authors after the dot-com bubble popped early last decade. He found that double-switchers — companies that added and later dropped their dot-com identity — saw their stock prices over one month move 38.5 percent ahead of companies that kept the dot-com name. In a few years, maybe being labeled a logistics company won’t be such a bad thing.\\n\\nYahoo to Acquire Polyvore in Shopping-Advertising Push:\\xa0Yahoo is buying shopping-service Polyvore Inc., seeking to improve its online fashion content and boost shopping-related advertising. Polyvore, which combines social and e-commerce tools for apparel and accessories, will initially be integrated into Yahoo’s magazines that focus on beauty and style, according to Simon Khalaf, senior vice president at Yahoo. Terms of the deal, subject to customary closing conditions, weren’t disclosed in a statement Friday by the companies. Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer is pushing to add more news, entertainment and shopping information to the Web portal in order to draw a bigger audience and sell advertising. Polyvore lets users put together themed collections of items, like those seen in fashion magazines. People can browse through the collections and then buy the items. Polyvore will add more than 350 retailers to Yahoo’s advertising platform, the companies said.\\n\\n\\n')\n",
      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\nUber to invest $1 billion in India: FT:\\xa0Online ride hailing service Uber is set to invest $1 billion in India, which will bring its investment on par with that in China, the Financial Times reported. Uber said that this move would help its service reach 1 million daily rides by March 2016, the first time the company has set such target for India, FT said. Amit Jain, president of Uber India, said the company was \"extremely bullish\" on the Indian market and that it continues to see a 40 percent monthly growth, FT reported. Jain also added that the company will expand service beyond the 18 cities in which it operates, the largest number in any country outside of the United States. On Wednesday, Uber launched its own auto leasing subsidiary in an effort to sign up more drivers, injecting the fast-growing ride services company directly into the financial services sector for the first time.\\n\\nLinkedIn Shares Slip on Concerns Lynda Buy Masks a Slowdown:\\xa0LinkedIn shares fell after the company attributed a bump in its annual revenue forecast to its acquisition of the education website Lynda.com, raising concerns that growth is slowing in its main business. LinkedIn said full-year sales would be about $2.94 billion, beating the $2.91 billion average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. As part of the forecast, the company more than doubled expectations for revenue from the Lynda.com acquisition to $90 million for the year, raising questions about whether the professional-networking website’s core business was expected to slow. The company acquired Lynda.com for $1.5 billion while it also reorganized its sales force and changed advertising methods -- expensive moves that may take time to produce benefits. The Lynda.com purchase and LinkedIn’s efforts to promote news content are intended to make the website valuable to people even when they aren’t looking for jobs. LinkedIn initially rose as much as 15 percent in extended trading after the earnings were released, only to erase those gains and fall as low as 9 percent to $207 during the company’s conference call with investors. Second-quarter sales increased 33 percent to $711.7 million, while analysts’ estimated $679.9 million. LinkedIn’s loss widened to $67.7 million, or 53 cents, from $1.03 million, or 1 cent, a year earlier, the Mountain View, California-based company said. LinkedIn’s Talent Solutions business was its fastest-growing segment in the quarter, gaining 38 percent to $433 million after the sales force shake-up. The jobs site, which reported 380 million users, said those people spent 60 percent more time on LinkedIn than they did a year earlier. The company reduced the amount of e-mails it sends out by 40 percent to reduce complaints and improve the quality of the experience. The company said its China-based site now has more than 10 million members.\\n\\nSocial Media Stocks and Their Unforgiving Investors:\\xa0Several social media stocks took a pummeling on Wednesday, with Yelp plunging 25 percent and Twitter dropping 15 percent after both companies issued quarterly earnings that disappointed investors in one way or another. On top of that, Facebook’s shares fell slightly in after-hours trading after it posted financial results that included a surge in spending and a forecast of slowing revenue growth. Few should be surprised by the stock reaction. Investors have demonstrated for many months that they are unforgiving of any stumble by technology companies that became alluring because they had portrayed themselves as high growth. See what happened last quarter with LinkedIn, Yelp and Twitter, which all plummeted more than 20 percent shortly after reporting results that surprised investors (and not in a good way). At the time, Vindu Goel and Mike Isaac wrote that “shareholders increasingly have little tolerance for the slightest misstep” by social-media companies — something that was once again made very clear this week.\\n\\nIn rural China, shoppers go online - with a little help:\\xa0Cheng Yonghao left his village in central Henan province almost 20 years ago, not expecting to return. He\\'s now back home, and this week opened a village store to help locals shop online. Cheng is just one of an army of local recruits who are part of Alibaba Group\\'s big bet on rural e-commerce as China\\'s internet giants invest billions in outpost service hubs to tap a market twice the size of the United States. E-commerce growth in the countryside now outpaces that in major cities, though fewer than one tenth of online purchases made on Alibaba platforms were shipped to rural areas in the first quarter of this year. Alibaba estimates the potential market at 460 billion yuan ($74 billion) by next year. Rival JD.com also says that developing rural e-commerce is a key strategy this year. While the rewards are enticing, few are making money yet. \"We don\\'t know when our rural e-commerce operations will become profitable, but there\\'s value in what we\\'re doing, there\\'s consumer demand,\" Gao Hongbing, director of Alibaba\\'s research arm, told reporters earlier this month. Before it can reap the rewards, Alibaba is having to teach a rural population - which tends to be older, poorer and less comfortable with technology - how to browse and buy. Alibaba has been on a recruitment drive to find and train local \\'partners\\', who set up service centers in their home villages, helping locals shop online. Partners - mostly younger, educated, and more familiar with navigating websites like Taobao, Alibaba\\'s online emporium - go through a written exam, computer test and interview. More than 1,000 applied for one batch of 50 jobs, said one applicant from Henan. Training takes place at local government business offices over 2-3 days in groups of around four dozen. Trainees are asked about their aspirations and how they can reach their potential.\\n\\nMakeMyTrip sales growth skids in Q1, lowers revenue guidance for the year:\\xa0MakeMyTrip reported a slow net revenue growth of just 7.5 per cent (14.7 per cent in constant currency) for the first quarter ended June 30, 2015 over the year-ago period. This was due to a mere 2.8 per cent rise in net revenues from hotels and packages segment (10.4 per cent in constant currency). Net revenues from the air ticketing business rose 10.8 per cent (17.6 per cent in constant currency). Overall net revenue as captured by revenue less service cost, a key metrics for OTAs like MakeMyTrip, rose 27.5 per cent (28.4 per cent in constant currency) in Q4 FY15 and 36.3 per cent in Q1 FY15. Net revenues for the last quarter stood at $38.1 million. Overall revenues declined 1.2. per cent (roe 5.2 per cent in constant currency) to $93.6 million in the quarter while gross bookings, which represent the total amount paid by a customer while booking on its platform, rose 8.3 per cent (15.6 per cent in constant currency) to $467.8 million. In terms if operating stats, booking transactions in its hotels and packages segment rose 14.4 per cent to 430,100. This was overshadowed by a robust 45.6 per cent rise in air ticketing transactions that rose to 1.6 million last quarter. The transaction growth in air ticketing business was largely driven by special fares offered by Indian domestic carriers. The firm also saw its net margins from the air ticketing segment shrink from 5.8 per cent in Q1 FY15 to 5.5 per cent last quarter. Net margins in the hotels and packages segment, however, increased from 11.9 per cent in the quarter ended June 30, 2014 to 13.3 per cent. This was also in line with net revenue margin of 13.2 per cent for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Operating loss almost doubled from $3.4 million to $6.1 million while adjusted operating loss (excluding employee share-based compensation costs, merger and acquisitions related expenses and amortisation of acquisition related intangibles) stood at $1.6 million compared with operating profit of $0.3 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2014\\n\\nBaidu Plans $1 Billion Buyback to Bolster Slipping Stock Price:\\xa0Baidu, China’s biggest Internet search engine company, said on Thursday it will buy back shares worth $1 billion after the company’s stock price slid following a weak earnings report earlier this week. The repurchases will take place over the next 12 months and be funded from the company’s existing cash balance, New York-listed Baidu said in a statement. Baidu shares have fallen 14 percent since July 27, when it reported lower-than-expected second-quarter profit. The company’s plan to spend aggressively on connecting online smartphone users to offline services raised investor concerns on margins, triggering the shares’ worst two-day drop since late 2008. Baidu said last month it would invest $3.2 billion in linking mobile internet users to nearby offline services such as buying cinema tickets, booking taxis, getting restaurant deals. But these O2O services are eroding the healthy margins Baidu enjoyed from its core search business.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArchived\\xa0snippets\\xa0are\\xa0here\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Fa\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook Revenue Tops Estimates; Shares Drop as Spending Surges:\\xa0Facebook, buoyed by robust advertising sales, signaled that it will keep up its brisk pace of investments to attract users and advertisers. Spending climbed 82 percent in the second quarter as the social-media company increased hiring, poured money into data centers and boosted marketing. While that was more than double the rate of sales growth, Facebook still managed to top analysts’ revenue estimate, crossing the $4 billion mark for the first time. Net income shrank to $719 million from $791 million a year earlier, while the operating margin, a measure of profitability, narrowed to 31 percent from 48 percent. Revenue rose 39 percent to $4.04 billion. Yet Facebook also signaled that it wouldn’t let investments grow uncontrollably. The company forecast that expenses will rise 55 percent to 60 percent this year, compared with a previous range of 55 percent to 65 percent. Facebook is improving tools for advertisers and expanding the audience for its mobile applications beyond Facebook itself, including Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, which have yet to contribute meaningfully to revenue. Monthly active users for Facebook’s main social network jumped 13 percent to 1.49 billion, with 1.31 billion people logging in at least once a month via mobile. Shares of Menlo Park, California-based Facebook fell 3.4 percent in extended trading, after advancing 1.8 percent to $96.99 at the close in New York. The stock is up 24 percent this year. Facebook’s ability to keep adding users and keeping them engaged stands in stark contrast to Twitter, which is struggling to break past 300 million people. The total number of Facebook users who logged in daily rose to 968 million in June, the company said, slightly less than the 970.5 million projection of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.\\n\\nSamsung Electronics cautious on outlook, says mobile business environment tough:\\xa0Samsung Electronics offered a downbeat outlook for the third quarter after April-June profit dropped on a supply shortage for one of its main smartphone models, underscoring continued headwinds for the tech giant. Samsung remained the world\\'s top smartphone seller in the second quarter, but investors and analysts say the South Korean firm\\'s inability to meet demand for its curved-screen S6 edge smartphones likely cost the firm in April-June. Second-quarter operating profit fell 4 percent to $5.9 billion, matching an estimate issued by the company early this month. But the firm doubled its interim dividend payout to 1,000 won per common share. The firm said on Thursday that the mobile division faces a tough business environment as smartphone market growth slows. On the bright side, the chips division reported an operating profit of 3.40 trillion won, up from 1.86 trillion won a year earlier on the back of healthy demand for memory chips and sales growth for its mobile processors. Overall, annual profit is expected to rebound from a three-year low marked in 2014, thanks to robust semiconductor profits and some stabilization for the mobile business. In addition to the supply shortage for the S6 edge model, some analysts are worried by softer demand from China and Europe. Research firm TrendForce last week cut its forecast for 2015 global smartphone shipment growth to 8.2 percent from 11.6 percent, citing a weaker world economic outlook.\\n\\nAlibaba cloud unit sets sights on Amazon in $1 billion global push:\\xa0Alibaba said on Wednesday it would invest $1 billion into its Aliyun cloud computing arm to challenge Amazon.com\\'s lucrative Web Services division, opening a global front in the battle between the two e-commerce giants. With the global cloud computing market estimated by analysts to be worth about $20 billion, Alibaba said in a statement the investment would go toward setting up new Aliyun data centers in the Middle East, Singapore, Japan and Europe. The firm also plans to strike business partnerships with telecom and enterprise technology providers in those regions. Although Alibaba and Amazon have so far avoided competing directly in their core business of e-commerce outside China, Aliyun\\'s international expansion takes aim squarely at Amazon Web Services (AWS), an increasingly central and profitable division of the Seattle-based company. Amazon shares soared last week after the company reported, among other items, an 81 percent revenue increase for AWS, which hosts Web customers like Netflix and Airbnb. As it expands, Aliyun will face stiff competition from some of the biggest names in technology. Amazon led the global cloud infrastructure market with a 28 percent share in 2014, trailed by Microsoft, IBM and Google Inc at 10, 7 and 5 percent, respectively, according to Synergy Research Group. After Amazon made a limited \"beta\" entry into China last year, where cloud adoption rates by businesses are far lower than in the rest of the world, Aliyun opened a data center in Silicon Valley in March to serve U.S. customers. \"Our goal is to overtake Amazon in four years, whether that\\'s in customers, technology, or worldwide scale\".\\n\\nSteep Discounts a Boon for Customers, but a Gamble for Start-Upsh:\\xa0Jet.com, a well-funded new shopping site, opened to the public last week and celebrated the debut by sending reporters a big box of swag. I got a T-shirt with a company logo, fuzzy socks, stickers and $1,400 in oversize, fake $100 bills. Jet is a discount site, so I suspect the funny money was meant to illustrate the cash I’d save by shopping there. But the faux bills immediately evoked a more cautious reminder — of all the money Jet plans to spend to become the next force in online shopping. It isn’t just Jet. On a venture-capital high, tech start-ups are burning through vast cash reserves to offer rock-bottom prices, and to sign up new customers with discounts, giveaways and other deals that may sound too good to be true. Jet, a Costco-like members-only discount company that has raised more than $225 million from investors before opening its doors, is only the largest such example. Forget the fake bills; for Jet, as well as for many of its smaller start-up kin, giving away real money is a key part of business. This sounds fishy. But there’s an upside: While investors’ cash lasts, consumers could be in for a boon. After all, from the perspective of customers, what’s so bad about companies giving away their venture-funneled cash? Jet’s prices may be the most ambitious. In May, I found the company was vastly undercutting Amazon, and The Wall Street Journal recently ordered a basket of goods from the site for which it calculated that Jet lost nearly $243 on a single order. In an interview, Mr. Lore was unfazed by these numbers, because, he said, they were already built into his projections. “We understand really well what these costs are now and how they’ll come down over time, and it’s simply a matter of understanding how much capital it’s going to take,” he said. In fact, he added, losing money on each order isn’t his biggest worry; instead, it’s failing to draw enough orders to get to scale. “The hard part is, can you get to $20 billion in five years?” The only way to get there, Mr. Lore said, is to keep spending. Whether or not he’s right, enjoy it.\\n\\nE-commerce firms boost Indian postal department revenues:\\xa0With e-commerce platforms increasingly turning to the Indian Posts to deliver their orders to customers, the fast flourishing e-retail business has become a revenue generator for the state-run agency, whose traditional operations are dented by the deep penetration of e-mail and mobile phones. Realising the potential, the Postal Department has set up a dedicated e-commerce and parcel processing center in the country’s commercial hub Mumbai. Spread across 12,000 sq ft, the facility at Parel in the city has bagged good business in a short span, handling around 5,000 orders a day. The department officials expect at this pace the traffic would soon increase to 10,000 parcels per day. The facility has a capacity to process 30,000 parcels per day.\\n\\nGoogle Loon To Cover Entire Country Of Sri Lanka With Internet:\\xa0Google is working on many things, and that includes balloons that fly high in the sky to bring Internet infrastructure to locations that can’t be wired for it easily. Today, Sri Lanka announced that it’s the first country to ever get universal Internet access from Google’s Project Loon. Thanks to a partnership with Google, the country promises “affordable high-speed Internet” for all of its residents. Google Loon was announced in 2013, with only incremental and anecdotal information hitting the presses up until now. This is a landmark moment for Loon, and clearly for Sri Lanka.\\n\\nGitHub Raises $250M Series B Round To Take Risks:\\xa0GitHub, the software development collaboration and version control service based on the popular open source Git tool, today announced that it has raised a $250 million funding round led by Sequoia Capital. Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital and Institutional Venture Partners also participated in this round. The company, which was founded back in 2008, has now taken a total of $350 million in outside funding. While the company isn’t talking about its valuation, the WSJ reports that it’s currently hovering around $2 billion. GitHub’s 2012 Series A round was led by Andreessen Horowitz. At the time, the company’s valuation was said to be around $750 million. As GitHub CEO and co-founder Chris Wanstrath told me shortly after the new round was announced, the company plans to use this new round to accelerate growth and expand its sales and engineering team (as most companies do when they raise). He also stressed, though, that the round isn’t just meant for that. “The round is not just to accelerate, but also to allow us to think bigger and take larger risks,” Wanstrath said. This means GitHub acquisitions are likely on the horizon, but he also noted that the company wants to push its international strategy forward. It recently opened an office in Japan (and hosted its first meetup there) and other locations will likely follow. There can be no doubt that Git has become something of a de facto version control system for many startups and GitHub currently leads the charge among companies that essentially offer Git as a service. Atlassian, Microsoft, GitLab and others offer similar services, both cloud-hosted and on premise, but GitHub has clearly attracted most of the mindshare in recent years. GitHub says it currently has about 10 million users who are in collaboration on over 25 million projects (that’s up from 10 million in January 2014). Given that the company offers free accounts, it’s not clear how many of these users are actually paying for the service, though (pricing starts at $5/month).\\n\\nCaller ID App Truecaller Is Raising $100M At A $1B Valuation; India Is Its Biggest Market:\\xa0Communications apps that strike a chord with users across different markets are hot property these days, and it looks like another one of them may soon enter the so-called unicorn club. TechCrunch has learned that Truecaller — a caller ID app that now has 150 million users — is looking to raise around $100 million at a $1 billion valuation. We’re hearing that Truecaller has hired Morgan Stanley to lead the process, and there are term sheets out. The round is likely to have previous and new investors. To date, True Software, maker of Truecaller, has raised around $80 million. Previous investors include Atomico, Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, Sequoia Capital, Access Partners and Open Ocean. The plan will be to use the funds to grow the product. Truecaller, founded in Sweden, has seen a lot of traction in markets like India, its biggest market at 80 million users. Now it wants to expand elsewhere, like the U.S., and will be building out the company’s office in the Bay Area. The company is projected to hit 300 million users this year. Truecaller works by aggregating directory services via deals with white pages companies, and platforms like Yelp to bring in businesses. It complements this with crowdsourced information from the app’s users. That includes accessing your own address book, although you can opt out. Individual users can also opt out from being listed. It then uses big data analytics and machine learning to offer additional services beyond caller ID such as predicting who you might want to call next based on where you are and what time of day it is, or what the top-reported spam number is in your area at the moment. Other features include spam blocking, directory services and “smart” SMS services. The company makes revenues through in-app purchases for premium features, as well as advertising within the app. The company’s country manager for India has also reportedly said that Truecaller may launch a paid version by the end of this year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArchived snippets\\xa0are\\xa0here, and MP3 versions are\\xa0here\\n\\n\\nTwitter Shares Surge on Earnings Beat, then Slump on Slowing User Growth:\\xa0After reporting quarterly sales that topped estimates, interim Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey and Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto struck a critical tone, saying user growth won’t improve until the social-media company reaches a mass market -- something that will take a mixture of product improvements and marketing. The company’s efforts so far have had minimal success, they said. Shares dropped 11 percent in extended trading, after climbing as much as 12 percent following the earnings release. n the second quarter, revenue rose 61 percent to $502.4 million, the social-media company said Tuesday in a statement. That exceeded analysts’ average projection for $481.9 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Twitter’s net loss narrowed to $136.7 million, or 21 cents a share. Profit excluding certain items was 7 cents, compared with the 4 cents analysts estimated. On a conference call, executives quashed any initial optimism generated by the report by confronting Twitter’s underlying problem: It’s much smaller than the competition. The company today reported 316 million monthly users, while Facebook has 1.4 billion. Twitter recently started counting feature-phone users in emerging markets as part of its tally. Without that extra boost, Twitter’s user count was 304 million. Noto said Twitter changed its tone on the call because growth slowed so meaningfully, the company wanted to explain how it’s working to address the deceleration. “In the past we may not have had the growth that investors wanted us to have, but it was still quite strong. And this quarter we barely had any growth.”\\n\\nYelp Plunges After Reducing Sales Forecast, Ending Brand Ads:\\xa0Yelp, the customer-review website, plunged as much as 18 percent when it reduced its revenue forecasts and said it will stop selling national brand advertising. Yelp lowered its third-quarter sales forecast to a range of $139 million to $142 million, below analysts’ average estimate of $152.7 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Annual revenue was projected at $544 million to $550 million from an April forecast of $574 million to $579 million. The website attracts more than 160 million visitors looking for customer reviews about local businesses. National brand advertising revenue decreased 8 percent to $8.3 million in the second quarter and Yelp will phase out those sales by the end of the year to focus on its core local advertising. Yelp shares fell in April after the company reported declining advertising sales. The shares rebounded in May following reports that Yelp was exploring a possible sale. Yelp reported a net loss of $1.3 million, or 2 cents a share in the quarter, from a profit of $2.7 million, or 4 cents a share, a year earlier. “I certainly think they can survive, as to whether or not they can flourish time will tell,”\\n\\nAkamai forecasts revenue, profit below estimates; shares sink:\\xa0Online content distributor Akamai Technologies forecast third-quarter revenue and profit below estimates, citing a stronger dollar. Shares of Akamai, which claims to deliver between 15 and 30 percent of all Web traffic, fell as much as 13 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday. The company\\'s second-quarter profit fell nearly 8 percent after 11 quarters of growth, as costs rose. Akamai, whose customers include MTV Networks and online home rental marketplace Airbnb, forecast an adjusted profit of 56-58 cents per share and revenue of $543 million-$555 million for the current quarter. Akamai and rivals Limelight Networks and Level 3 Communications face increasing competition as companies such as Amazon, Netflix and Comcast enter the content delivery market. Akamai has been trying to differentiate itself by investing in cloud security services, as well as investing to expand its content delivery platform to better handle rising video traffic. Revenue rose 13.6 percent to $540.7 million, beating the average estimate of $540.4 million. Overall net income fell to $67.2 million, or 37 cents per share, from $72.9 million, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Up to Tuesday\\'s close of $73.65, Akamai\\'s shares had risen about 17 percent this year.\\n\\nStripe, Digital Payments Start-Up, Raises New Funding and Partners With Visa:\\xa0Stripe is gaining more financial allies to help it take on the digital payments industry. The start-up, based in San Francisco, said on Tuesday that it had raised new funding from investors like Visa, American Express and Sequoia Capital, among others, valuing the young company at $5 billion. That is a significant jump for Stripe, coming roughly six months after it garnered $70 million at a $3.5 billion valuation. Stripe declined to disclose the amount of new funding, except to say it was “less than $100 million.” Founded five years ago, Stripe has quickly gained traction by offering simple software and services for online small and medium-size businesses. Similar to Square and PayPal, Stripe accepts credit and debit cards for merchants who have not taken them previously. Stripe charges a small fee per transaction. On Tuesday Stripe also announced a partnership with Visa, one of the world’s largest credit card companies, in which the two will work on ways to improve digital transactions. The companies said they expected to collaborate on initiatives like payments security, as well as software like website “buy buttons.” Stripe said it would rely on Visa’s global footprint to expand its international availability. Stripe is currently available to businesses in more than 25 countries, and hopes to expand further with help from Visa. That Visa is partnering with Stripe instead of a larger payments processor is something of a coup for the start-up. Visa has become increasingly wary of other payments companies, such as PayPal, which processed more than $220 billion in online transactions last year and this month was spun off from its onetime parent, eBay. While PayPal has handled online credit transactions since the early days of e-commerce, Visa said it became concerned by PayPal’s ability to siphon customer relationships away from card companies and steer customers to debit transactions, in which PayPal sees healthier profit margins.\\n\\nLinkedIn, Notorious for Sending Too Many Emails, Cuts Back:\\xa0On Monday, LinkedIn decided that less is more. In a blog post, the site acknowledged its history of overzealous email habits and said it was taking steps to reduce the amount that users would receive. Among the examples, users who receive too many requests to connect will now get just one weekly digest, and users who subscribe to several of the site’s groups will get updates in a streamlined format. “For every 10 emails we used to send, we’ve removed 4 of them,” Aatif Awan wrote in the post. “Already, member’s complaints have been cut in half.”\\n\\nPrice Is Only One Weapon Amazon Is Using to Win the Cloud War:\\xa0Remember how a few months ago there was talk of a “price war”in the world of cloud computing services? It’s over and all the signs point to Amazon having won. As we reported last week, Amazon posted a stunning 81 percent rise in revenue at its Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit, along with a five-fold surge in the unit’s operating income, giving it an operating margin of 21 percent. During the quarter Amazon said it cut prices on many of its cloud services for the 49th time since the service launched in 2006. Meanwhile, at least one of Amazon’s rivals — Microsoft’s cloud computing service Azure — raised some of its prices in Europe and Australia. Portions of emails to Azure customers published by the Dublin-based blogger Aidan Finn earlier this month detailed price increases of 11 percent in Europe and up to 26 percent in Australia. The last time Amazon gave a ballpark estimate for how many customers it had on AWS was late last year when it said it had more than one million active customers. It hasn’t updated that figure since then. Whatever the number, it suggests that the average revenue per customer is on the rise. If Amazon’s margins are increasing it implies that its operational costs are coming down at the same time that its customer count is going up. Logically speaking, that implies that quality of service might suffer. There’s a few reasons that it doesn’t, and it has to do with how Amazon’s costs come down as it scales up. As Amazon’s cloud footprint grows, its fixed costs per customer on things like commodity memory chips and electricity decrease. The more chips and power it buys, the more negotiating leverage it has to squeeze a good deal from suppliers. Meanwhile, business and administrative costs associated with keeping the system running — billing and personnel, for example — shrink as more customers sign on and processes become more efficient. Finally, there’s more that those customers can do with AWS all the time. Amazon has added 350 individual new features to AWS in the first half of the year. Two new services include one called AWS Device Farm which allows mobile app developers to run their software on simulated Android mobile phones. At its current pace it will by sometime this fall have added about 700. And the pace at which those features are being added is increasing too. Last year it added 516 new features. The year before that, it was 280, and the year before that 159.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArchived\\xa0snippets\\xa0are\\xa0here, and MP3 versions are\\xa0here\\n\\n\\nGoogle Loosens Ties to Google Plus:\\xa0On Monday, Google said it would move features once integrated into Google Plus out of the social network and into other Google services. Photo features have already been moved to the newly introduced Google Photos. Location-sharing will go to Google Hangouts, the company’s chat app. Users will also no longer need a Google Plus account to comment on YouTube, long a point of contention among customers who felt as if they were being roped into using a social network they did not ask for. Altogether, the moves, announced in a blog post on Monday, are a moment of reckoning for Google Plus and those who created it. “While we got certain things right, we made a few choices that, in hindsight, we’ve needed to rethink,” Bradley Horowitz, who oversees Google Plus, wrote about the moves. He was even more contrite on his personal Google Plus page: “We want to formally retire the notion that a Google+ membership is required for anything at Google.” Driving home that point, Google said it would make it easier for users to delete Google Plus accounts, if they choose to. Started in 2011 and promoted as Google’s answer to Facebook, Google Plus initially appeared popular on paper. The social network reached 300 million monthly active users in just two years, according to the company. But much of that growth, analysts say, came because users needed to create Google Plus accounts to use some of the company’s other services, like YouTube, annoying many longtime users of those services. But Google’s decision to dismantle Google Plus may have less to do with appeasing users’ anger than with meeting the demand of mobile phone owners, who expect apps for each individual service. Rather than make an app or website that is a one-stop shop, tech companies instead are introducing stables of services. Twitter has Vine, a video-sharing app, and Periscope, a live-streaming app, separate from the main Twitter platform. Facebook not only broke out photos and messaging into separate apps, but also decided to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp, direct competitors to those services, and maintain them both as yet another set of options for smartphone owners.\\n\\nIn its next move, Amazon could turn to physical grocery stores:\\xa0Amazon wants to set up drive-through grocery stores where consumers can pick up goods they\\'ve ordered online, according to the Silicon Valley Business Journal. Where this could have the biggest impact is on perishables, which obviously require timely delivery. Although shoppers can already buy some perishables through Amazon Fresh and get them delivered the same day, the $300 annual membership isn\\'t for everyone. And the logistics of delivering fresh groceries right to people\\'s homes is still a big challenge. Amazon has reportedly explored retail locations before, but doing it just for groceries would be a different thing entirely.\\n\\nEBay Ends Same-Day Delivery in U.S. in Face of Amazon Effort:\\xa0EBay Inc. is killing its U.S. same-day delivery service EBay Now, an acknowledgment it won’t try to match the speedy delivery of e-commerce giant Amazon.com. The online marketplace hinted the service wasn’t performing last year when it canceled the EBay Now mobile application and encouraged its use on desktops. The program had been available in the San Francisco area, New York, Dallas and Chicago. Amazon has invested heavily in same-day delivery, offering the service for free to Amazon Prime subscribers in New York, Seattle, San Francisco and other large cities.\\n\\nBaidu Sales Outlook Misses Estimates on Weaker Chinese Economy; Shares Tumble:\\xa0Baidu shares fell as much as 9.5 percent after U.S. markets closed, after already being down 6.3 percent at during the Asian trading day; forecast quarterly sales missed estimates as China’s biggest search-engine provider expands into delivery services and movie ticketing amid a weakening domestic economy. The company’s second-quarter net income climbed 3.3 percent to 3.66 billion yuan, missing the 3.9 billion-yuan average of analyst estimates. Second-quarter revenue rose 38 percent to 16.6 billion yuan, compared with the company’s April forecast of 16.365 billion yuan to 16.75 billion yuan. Mobile accounted for 50 percent of sales, in line with the prior quarter, Baidu said. Active users of its mobile wallet climbed by 9 million to reach 35 million in June, Li, the chief executive officer, said in a conference call Tuesday. Revenue for its IQiyi service climbed to 1 billion yuan during the second quarter, he said. Baidu is also said to be in talks to buy a new stake in the local unit of car-booking provider Uber Technologies Inc., adding to its investment in the company’s global operations. Baidu last month sold $1.25 billion of debt to fund Chinese operations and said it will invest 20 billion yuan over three years into Nuomi.\\n\\nAlibaba Appoints Tsai to Lead Board at New Local Services Unit Koubei:\\xa0Alibaba Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai will head up the board at Koubei, underscoring the strategic importance of a new business unit that will spearhead the e-commerce company’s drive into the local services market. Tsai’s new responsibilities as Koubei’s chairman come on top of his current role as the number two executive at Alibaba, the company said in an email confirming his appointment on Monday. Alibaba executives have stressed the importance of establishing a foothold beyond e-commerce in what they call an “online to offline” market, which refers to the increasing use of mobile devices to buy physical goods and services. Tsai joined Alibaba in 1999 and he helped transform Alibaba into a global powerhouse, leading negotiations on dozens of acquisitions and early financing rounds, including with SoftBank Corp. Koubei, a joint venture set up by Alibaba and its financial services affiliate, is competing with Baidu and Tencent in a market for local services that’s expected to reach 7.28 trillion yuan ($1.17 trillion) by 2017. Local services is a key area of contention for Chinese Internet companies as people turn to the web to order take-out, beauty treatments and domestic helpers. Chinese users of location-based services could rise 29 percent to 400 million people in 2017 compared with this year, according to a research report by Shanghai-based Internet consultant IResearch. Baidu said in June it would invest 20 billion yuan in three years to expand its own location-based services platform, called Nuomi. And group discount website Meituan.com, which is also competing in the same field, raised $700 million in January this year to fund expansion.\\n\\nPepperfry raises $100M from Goldman Sachs, Zodius, others:\\xa0Mumbai-based Pepperfry.com, an e-commerce marketplace for furniture, home decor and appliances, has secured $100 million in funding from Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Zodius Technology Fund. The company’s existing investors Norwest Venture Partners and Bertelsmann India Investments have also participated in this round of funding, according to its founder and CEO Ambareesh Murthy. TrendSutra Platform Services Pvt Ltd, the company behind Pepperfry.com, will use the money to expand its logistics footprint in over 300 towns and for ‘quadrupling’ the size of its technology team, Murthy told Techcircle.in. The company will also use the funds to add new ‘experience centres’ and for upping digital marketing spend. Avendus Capital was the exclusive financial advisor to Pepperfry for this round of funding. Started in January 2012 with categories like home, lifestyle, fashion and more, Pepperfry now specialises in furniture and home products on its managed marketplace platform. The company not only markets furniture and home decor products through its site, but also employs carpenters and operates a fleet of over 350 delivery vehicles. Prior to the latest transaction, Pepperfry had bagged close to $30 million in funding. Pepperfry is expected to have crossed Rs 500 crore in GMV this year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArchived\\xa0snippets\\xa0are\\xa0here, and MP3 versions are\\xa0here\\n\\n\\nYelp Cries Foul at Google’s Mobile App Ad Declaration:\\xa0Those ads that splash on your phone, nudging you to install an app? You know the ones. Earlier this week, Google released an internal study showing that these app download “interstitials” were not merely obnoxious but ineffective, hindering the intended goal of encouraging app installation. Google said it was retiring them and asked the mobile Internet to do the same. Some were pleased. Some were not. Firmly in the latter camp is Jeremy Stoppelman, Yelp CEO and frequent Google sparring partner. On Friday, he pointed to the study and cried hypocrite. Here’s the background: Google’s test paired the full-page ads against subtler banner promotions on mobile websites. Nine percent of mobile users tapped through to the app from the first ads, while 69 percent ran away from the site. With the second version, Google reported an uptick of 17 percent in traffic to the app. Innocuous enough. But Stoppelman is not just accusing Google of a double standard (running its own app ads while nixing others). Behind his beef is the suspicion, percolating in the mobile industry now, that Google is trying to replicate its Web search position with apps. In the past year, Google has pushed aggressively to index the entirety of the app world, while positioning itself, through deep-linking features like the upcoming Now on Tap, as the facilitator. And with Google as facilitator, that leaves less room for other app go-betweens, a la Yelp. It doesn’t help Google’s case here that the interstitial study relied on its own Google+ social app, a Google application that, to be kind, is not terribly in demand.\\n\\nUsing Algorithms to Determine Character:\\xa0A company in Palo Alto, Calif., called Upstart has over the last 15 months lent $135 million to people with mostly negligible credit ratings. Typically, they are recent graduates without mortgages, car payments or credit card settlements. Those are among the things that normally earn a good or bad credit score, but these people haven’t been in the working world that long. So Upstart looks at their SAT scores, what colleges they attended, their majors and their grade-point averages. As much as job prospects, the company is assessing personality. “If you take two people with the same job and circumstances, like whether they have kids, five years later the one who had the higher G.P.A. is more likely to pay a debt,” said Paul Gu, Upstart’s co-founder and head of product. “It’s not whether you can pay. It’s a question of how important you see your obligation.” The idea, validated by data, is that people who did things like double-checking the homework or studying extra in case there was a pop quiz are thorough and likely to honor their debts. Analytics, meet judgment of people. “I guess you could call it character, though we haven’t used that label,” said Mr. Gu, who is 24. The same personality dynamic holds for people go to great schools or have top grades. Douglas Merrill, the founder and chief executive of ZestFinance, is a former Google executive whose company writes loans to subprime borrowers through nonstandard data signals. One signal is whether someone has ever given up a prepaid wireless phone number. Where housing is often uncertain, those numbers are a more reliable way to find you than addresses; giving one up may indicate you are willing (or have been forced) to disappear from family or potential employers. That is a bad sign. Zest recently branched into “near prime” borrowers, who have either fallen from the prime category or risen from subprime. The question is why these people have changed categories, and Zest tries to figure out if a potentially reliable borrower has had some temporary bad luck, like a one-time medical expense. “‘Character’ is a loaded term, but there is an important difference between ability to pay and willingness to pay,” said Mr. Merrill. “If all you look at is financial transactions, it’s hard to say much about willingness.”\\n\\nFacebook and Other Tech Giants Expand Internet Access in Africa:\\xa0Africa has become a hotbed of experimentation by big American technology companies as well as local start-ups. In addition to Facebook’s efforts, which included developing a Swahili language version of Facebook, Google, Microsoft and IBM have all been promoting tech projects on the continent. Google, for example, has built a high-speed, fiber-optic Internet network in Kampala, Uganda. But unlike the similar Google Fiber project in major American cities, Google doesn’t offer the service, called Project Link, directly to Ugandans but instead sells access cheap on a wholesale basis to local Internet providers. The result was a sharp drop in the price of Internet access in Kampala as new entrants competed with the traditional carriers to offer services. Microsoft has been supporting various projects to transmit Internet signals via “white spaces,” which are basically unused portions of the television broadcast spectrum. On Friday, the company announced that it was working with the United States government’s Overseas Private Investment Corporation to provide financing to Mawingu Networks to build solar-powered Internet access stations across rural Kenya using white spaces technology. And IBM said on Saturday that it would begin a formal program to assist entrepreneurs in Nairobi’s iHub innovation and collaboration space. And Africa seems to have brought a bit of kumbaya to the traditional tech rivals. “It’s the one place where I have seen Microsoft and Google and Facebook as allies,”\\n\\nFacebook partnership a boon for video technology firm Bidalgo:\\xa0Facebook marketing partner Bidalgo targets a tripling in sales in 2015 as its new technology to automate the process of making personalized online video advertising benefits from Facebook\\'s growing share of the video market. Facebook is becoming a leader in the video market as users prefer to watch video ads over static images, said Peleg Israeli, general manager of Bidalgo\\'s Israeli operations. Videos are expensive to make and an advertiser usually makes only one or two versions. The Bidalgo executive said his company\\'s technology, called ADaptation, can automatically turn one video into as many versions as needed, so that targeted audiences will see images they respond to most. For example, a German audience might see a German flag in one video while users in France will see their flag. Automated videos will give Facebook an advantage over Google\\'s YouTube, as Facebook\\'s core technology can identify users \"in the most accurate way\". U.S.-Israeli Bidalgo\\'s technology targets mobile app and game developers, who have been quick to adopt mobile advertising. Clients include online gaming firm 888 Holdings and Zynga. Bidalgo, which has 40 employees, has been profitable for about a year, with a target of $100 million in sales this year, Israeli said. It competes with San Francisco-based Ampush and Boston-based Nanigans. Companies wishing to advertise on Facebook must bid for users that they wish to see their advertising. Bidalgo\\'s algorithms test an ad against multiple audiences to understand which segments are relevant and what is the right price the advertiser should offer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArchived snippets\\xa0are\\xa0here, and MP3 versions are\\xa0here\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon Reports Unexpected Profit, and Stock Soars; Market Value Exceeds Wal-Mart\\'s:\\xa0The e-commerce company beloved by Wall Street for its fast-growing ways did something completely out of character in the second quarter: It made a profit. It was only $92 million, practically a rounding error for Google or Apple. But it confirmed all the hopes and expectations of analysts and investors, who immediately pushed Amazon shares up 17 percent in after-hours trading Thursday to $566. Amazon’s second-quarter profit amounted to 19 cents a share. A year ago, the company lost 27 cents a share. Analysts had been predicting another loss of 13 cents. Revenue was better than expected, too, up 20 percent to $23.2 billion. That was about $800 million more than forecast. One big contribution to the improved profit and revenue was Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing division whose numbers were broken out for the first time in the first quarter. A.W.S. is the undisputed leader in the sector, outdistancing both Microsoft and Google, but analysts had been wondering if price cuts would hamper growth. Apparently not. A.W.S. revenue rose 81 percent to $1.82 billion from a year ago, even better than it did last quarter. In the first quarter, A.W.S. revenue was up 49 percent. Operating income for the cloud division rose to $391 million from $77 million. No wonder analysts on a conference call with Amazon financial executives offered their congratulations. Amazon hired another 50,000 employees over the last year, increasing its head count by 38 percent. Many of those workers are in its network of more than 100 fulfillment centers. Amazon held a Prime Day sale last week that was a demonstration of Prime’s power — and also a few of its problems. Enough shoppers found fault with the selection to create a popular Twitter hashtag, #PrimeDayFail. Michael Pachter, managing director of equity research for Wedbush Securities, estimated Amazon took in $1.5 billion in revenue on Prime Day, versus $250 million for a typical day during the quarter. “That means that they can deliver $1.25 billion of upside by scheduling a flash sale,” he said. “There’s no reason that they can’t do this once per quarter,” although he noted that no such announcement had been made.\\n\\n\\nAmazon’s Cloud Business Rose 81 Percent in Q2, Its Fastest Growing and Most Profitable Business:\\xa0Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing unit of the Web retail giant, grew its revenue by 81 percent year on year in the second quarter. It grew faster and with higher profit margins than any other aspect of Amazon’s business. AWS, which offers leased computing services to businesses, posted revenue of $1.82 billion, up from $1 billion a year ago, as part of its second-quarter results. By comparison, retail sales in North America grew only 26 percent to $13.8 billion from $11 billion a year ago. The cloud computing business also posted operating income of $391 million — up an astonishing 407 percent from $77 million at this time last year — for an operating margin of 21 percent, making it Amazon’s most profitable business unit by far. The North American retail unit turned in an operating margin of only 5.1 percent. The AWS profit margin has also risen despite price competition from the likes of Google, Microsoft and IBM. Last quarter, the operating margin at AWS was closer to 17 percent. If it were broken out as a separate business — something that some investors may want but which Amazon has no intention of doing — AWS would be on track to reach about $7 billion and change in revenue this year.\\n\\n\\nApple\\'s India test: how to gain volume and meet aspiration:\\xa0For years, India has been a low priority for Apple as spending power is weaker than in China, where the company\\'s iPhones swiftly became must-have devices after their 2007 launch. But Apple is now looking to build on a 93 percent increase in its iPhone sales in India in April-June, which for the first time outpaced growth in China, of 87 percent - albeit from a low base. Apple has just a 2 percent share of India\\'s smartphone market, while South Korean rival Samsung Electronics accounts for around one third of volume sales with its range of Android phones. \"Apple is consciously expanding its distribution in India and pushing its products aggressively. The marketing spend too is a part of that,\" said Jaideep Mehta, managing director for India and South Asia at tech research firm IDC. Executives at several electronics retail chains and Apple distributors said the Cupertino-based firm was chasing shelf space to make its gadgets more visible, and has more than doubled the number of distributors to five. Apple has also brought in a new senior executive to take charge solely of the Indian market, industry sources said, and has placed advertisements for a policy adviser to help it work with New Delhi\\'s bureaucracy. \"Apple\\'s single-minded focus for India is on volume,\" said a senior executive at an electronics chain store, who declined to be named. \"They have increased distributors and want to reach out to smaller cities.\" Taking to Indian TV screens for the first time, Apple plays up the aspirational appeal of its phones, showing a glamorous Indian bride using Facetime, Apple\\'s video calling feature, to send coy flashes to her groom of a henna-ed hand or skirt hem before their wedding. In addition, Apple offers financing schemes where buyers of its latest iPhone 6 can pay in monthly instalments, and has launched Apple Music, a cloud-based music streaming service, for just 120 rupees ($1.88) a month in India - a fifth of the price in the United States. \"The premium smartphone market will be close to 8 million units in 2015,\" said Neil Shah, analyst at Counterpoint. \"Apple has a lot of room to grow and capture a significant share of that,\" he added, noting Apple sold just over a million iPhones in India in the year to April.\\n\\n\\nPandora Sales, Forecast Beat Estimates Amid Apple Pressure:\\xa0The largest Internet radio service reported a 30 percent increase in revenue to $285.6 million, according to a statement Thursday. Pandora is trying to grab advertisers from terrestrial radio while it faces pressure from rivals Spotify Ltd. and Apple. Pandora said listener hours rose 5 percent in the period ended June 30, the day of Apple Music’s debut. This quarter, sales will be $310 million to $315 million, the company said, above analysts’ estimates of $309.1 million. Both Spotify and Apple market streaming-music services that allow users to tailor their choice of songs and create music libraries. Each also offers Web-based radio that competes with Pandora. They use the free products to attract consumers to their paid services. Pandora raised its forecast for full-year revenue to a range of $1.175 billion to $1.185 billion.\\n\\n\\nFlipboard has confirmed that it has raised $50 million.\\xa0Flipboard didn’t provide valuation for the round, though JP Morgan is participating, and the funding will be used to build out the product and team, the company said. According to the regulatory documents, the valuation of the most-recent round could range from $800 million to $1.32 billion. The raise comes at a time when rumors cropped up that Twitter might buy Flipboard — though, to be sure, it’s not exactly clear how far those talks progressed — and had held discussions with a few other companies like Google and Yahoo. The company said its user base had jumped 75% in the past six months or so to 72 million monthly active users, with the vast majority of that coming from mobile devices. The company said it sees anywhere from 150,000 to 200,000 activations every day around the world. Still, the company will face stiff competition from new entries like Apple News — and will have to grapple whether the company can continue to grow in the face of that competition.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArchived snippets\\xa0are\\xa0here, and MP3 versions are\\xa0here\\n\\n\\n\\nQualcomm Reports Lower Earnings and Says It Will Cut Jobs:\\xa0Qualcomm had one of the best playbooks in tech, but it looks like the game is changing. The semiconductor designer and maker helped develop much of the technology used in mobile communications, particularly in smartphones. Qualcomm was a pioneer in the radio technology that makes it possible to send enormous amounts of data over wireless networks without clogging them. Virtually every maker of phones and wireless infrastructure needs to draw off Qualcomm’s intellectual property, which the company leases. The knowledge and profits Qualcomm earned from that business gave it both capital and a head start in building chips for phones, first in advanced third-generation, or 3G, digital networks, then in the succeeding 4G systems.With a market capitalization of $100 billion, over the last 15 years it became the world’s third-largest chip company in terms of revenue. Little of that was on display Wednesday, when Qualcomm reported lower earnings, and, under pressure from Wall Street, announced it would cut about 15 percent of its staff, or somewhere between 4,500 and 5,000 people. Spending will be reduced by $1.4 billion, the company said, including $300 million in shares that Qualcomm has been giving to its top executives and employees. Three new board members, approved by Jana Partners, a Wall Street investment firm that had been pressing for changes, will be put on Qualcomm’s 15-member board. Qualcomm said its third fiscal quarter’s net income was $1.2 billion, down 47 percent from a year earlier. Net income was 73 cents a share, down from $1.31 a share. Revenue fell 14 percent, to $5.8 billion, from $6.8 billion last year. The numbers were slightly higher than analysts had expected. The price of Qualcomm shares was down about 1.8 percent in after-hours trading.\\n\\nAmazon is expanding its on-demand home services business -- \"Amazon Home Services\" -- to 15 new cities:\\xa0Amazon announced Wednesday that it\\'s expanding its on-demand home services business -- transparently named \"Amazon Home Services\" -- to 15 new cities. The program was already operating in New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Los Angeles, offering users an easy way to book plumbers, electricians, cleaners and other people who can handle the things you may need around the house. The company announced that it is also expanding the service to let people request help with custom jobs, rather than just the pre-packaged services previously offered. The competition in the on-demand space for home tasks is heating up. Companies such as TaskRabbit jumped in early to the \"gig\" economy -- in fact, it integrates with Home Services -- and now a host other of cleaning, laundry and other service companies such as Handy, Thumbtack and others have found success providing on-demand workers to take care of your home needs. Amazon says its Home Services \"pros,\" as the service calls them, are vetted and required to keep all appropriate licenses to continue working with the service. Some use Amazon to expand their own businesses. Google is also thought to be jumping into the space. The company recently hired the technical team from Homejoy, a home-cleaning startup that shut down in part because it faced a lawsuit for classifying its workers as contractors rather than employees, Recode reported. The report suggested that Google may try and bake some sort of services link into its search results -- a sort of instant referral from the search page.\\n\\nIntel Issues $7 Billion in Bonds to Help Fund Takeover of Altera:\\xa0Intel tapped the bond market for $7 billion to finance part of its $16.7 billion takeover of Altera Corp. at lower rates than initially offered to investors. The world’s biggest chipmaker sold the longest portion of the four-part deal, $2 billion of 30-year, 4.9 percent securities, to yield 1.85 percentage points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The spread tightened as the day went on, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Similar-maturity debt was traded at a 1.8 percentage point spread in the secondary market on Tuesday, Bloomberg data show. Intel may have offered generous terms to appease investors dealing with a turbulent market, CreditSights analysts led by Erin Lyons wrote in a research note Wednesday, as a disappointing earnings forecast from Apple sent technology stocks tumbling. Speculation that Intel peer Qualcomm would split may have also “soured investors’ opinions of highly rated tech companies,” they wrote.\\n\\nAmazon’s Latest Prime Perk: A Five Percent Cash-Back Credit Card:\\xa0Amazon continues to make a concerted effort to add new perks to Amazon Prime as it tries to funnel new shoppers into the membership program that turns casual shoppers into Amazon addicts. Here’s another Prime benefit that many people might not know about: Access to an Amazon credit card that pays back 5 percent on every Amazon.com order. Amazon quietly introduced the card, the Amazon Prime Store Card, in March and has been slowly rolling out marketing for it on Amazon.com since then. But the company hasn’t done any PR around it, which is why I first learned of the Prime card by seeing a message on the site last week. The card has no annual fee and allows Prime members to get 5 percent back in the form of a statement credit on all Amazon.com orders — not just Prime purchases — that they place with the card. The card also comes with some promotional financing options, but you should read the fine print yourself because credit card application fine print ain’t nothing to mess with. The card is obviously great for Amazon if it attracts new shoppers to the Prime program, which costs $99 a year and comes with two-day shipping and media streaming, or helps retain current ones. But it’s also important because Amazon will likely be paying lower transaction fees on purchases made with Prime cards compared to purchases made with mainstream credit cards. That’s because store-branded cards typically carry low processing fees when they aren’t associated with Visa, MasterCard or American Express’ networks. As a result, expect Amazon to try its best to get cardholders to make the Prime Store Card the default payment option.\\n\\nTata Communications plans to sell data centre business:\\xa0Tata Communications plans to sell a 74% stake in its subsidiary Tata Communications Data Centre Pvt Ltd, reports indicate. Talks with some private equity and strategic investors have begun, and the deal size would likely be around $300 million and help Tata Communications reduce debt on its books. According to Tata Communications’ 2014 annual report, the data centre subsidiary is profitable, and returned a net profit of Rs. 23 crore for 2013-14 on a revenue of Rs. 375 crore. The company is yet to announce its numbers for 2014-15. “In the long run, unless the company is able to raise equity funding, its ability to raise additional debt funding may be restricted. This, in turn, could adversely affect the capital expenditure programme in the long run,” the annual report said. Tata Communications Data Centre has facilities in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata and Pune and some tier-II, and tier-III towns. The company also provides data centre services in the US, the UK and Singapore. It owns over 1 million sq. ft of data centre and co-location space across 44 global locations and also has eight partner sites in Australia, Malaysia, Germany and the Netherlands, according to the company’s website. In 2013-14, the Tata Communications had a 28% market share of the Indian data market and a 25% market share of the Indian data centre market, according to the company’s annual report. Several global and Indian firms are in the process of setting up data centres in India.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",
      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\n\\nArchived snippets are\\xa0here, and MP3 versions are\\xa0here\\n\\n\\nApple Profit Up 38%, but iPhone Sales Disappoint Wall Street:\\xa0Apple reported double-digit increases in sales and profit for its fiscal third quarter, a rate of growth that is highly unusual for a company of its size. Yet the results still fell short of estimates by Wall Street analysts, who are accustomed to Apple blowing past projections and had been predicting sky-high sales of iPhones and the company’s brand-new Apple Watch. In total, Apple reported a 38 percent increase in profit, to $10.7 billion, from a year ago, with revenue surging 33 percent to $49.6 billion. Sales of the company’s biggest revenue and profit generator, the iPhone, soared 35 percent to 47.5 million units. IPhone sales faced some tough sequential comparisons. The 47.5 million units sold in the quarter was below the roughly 50 million that analysts had calculated Apple would sell, and was also down from the 40 percent growth in the previous quarter and the 46 percent growth two quarters earlier. Still, the rate of growth exceeded the 13 percent increase in the same period a year ago. And while Apple did not share numbers on sales of the Apple Watch, which began selling in April, analysts on Tuesday calculated that the company had sold between 1.5 million and three million watches, far less than the three million to five million watches they had predicted ahead of Apple’s earnings report. Apple’s sales in the quarter were fueled by overseas buyers, with international regions accounting for 64 percent of the quarter’s overall revenue. Sales in the greater China region, one of Apple’s prime growth areas, more than doubled to $13.2 billion. The company also reported healthy growth for its Macintosh computer business. Apple sold 4.8 million Macs, up 9 percent from a year ago. Shares were down 7% in after-hours trading.\\n\\nJet.com Will Launch With Amazon Prices Front and Center:\\xa0Jet, the new shopping site that launches on Tuesday, promises shoppers “the lowest prices on everything.” To hammer home the point, the online mall will compare its price with Amazon’s price on every one of its product pages. As a way to prove its marketing promise, Jet tested its service with some customers who were given early access by showing its prices against those found on multiple competing websites. But after some people were confused by the appearance of the various competitors, Jet has decided to show its prices against just one competitor, Amazon, which typically has very low prices. “So it’ll be very easy for customers to understand that savings means savings compared to Amazon,” Jet CEO Marc Lore said of the changes in an interview on Monday. “They’re clearly the dominant player, so they’re a great reference point.” Lore said about 90 percent of Jet’s product listings at launch will show Jet’s discounted price compared with Amazon’s lowest price for the same item. The remaining 10 percent of Jet product pages will be updated with Amazon price comparisons over the next two months. There are some caveats. While Amazon often has the lowest prices, it doesn’t always. When that’s the case, Jet will discount the product below the lowest price found elsewhere on the Web, but will still show Amazon’s price for consistency’s sake, the company said. The Amazon prices also won’t factor in the fact that some of the products wouldn’t carry shipping fees for Amazon customers who pay $99 a year for Amazon Prime. Jet, meanwhile, charges $5.99 for orders under $35, while Amazon also charges delivery for orders of this size for non-Prime members. “If you have Prime, you’re not our target customer,” Lore said, explaining the rationale. “You’re getting video, you’re getting faster shipping. It’s a completely different animal.”\\n\\nMore on the launch of Jet - Jet is here. Let the price wars begin.:\\xa0After months of testing and tweaking, the e-commerce start-up Jet.com opened its digital storefront on Tuesday, marking the official kickoff of the company\\'s ambitious effort to battle Amazon and Wal-Mart for budget-conscious customers. Jet is taking a new approach to pricing. Its algorithm doesn\\'t simply look at the price of each individual item in your online shopping cart. It looks at all the items you want to buy, as well as your Zip code, to determine which retailer or warehouse can ship that unique combination of items to you the cheapest. Shoppers can only buy things on Jet if they\\'ve signed up for a $49-per-year membership. Ad Week reports that in this online store, viewing ads could lead to discounts as Jet.com is lowering bills wherever it can. It\\'s a risky business model. Lore has to get Jet.com to $20 billion in revenue by 2020 to make the site profitable. That kind of revenue means it would have to become one of the most successful e-commerce players in the world. The only money Jet.com would make comes from the $50 membership fee users pay to access the savings, which average about 15 percent on everything from detergent to sofas. The site offers deeper discounts depending on variables such as whether a customer pays with a credit or debit card, whether the order can be filled with an efficient shipping route, and whether the consumer waves the right to return items. All these little options help whittle down the price of a basket of goods.\\n\\nA $7 Billion Charge at Microsoft Leads to Its Largest Loss Ever:\\xa0An accounting charge wiped out Microsoft’s profit for the quarter, leading to its largest loss ever, the company said on Tuesday, making clear the cost of its missteps in the mobile business. The $7.5 billion accounting charge, stemming from Microsoft’s troubled acquisition of Nokia’s cellphone business, was disclosed by the company earlier this month, along with plans to eliminate 7,800 jobs, mostly in the company’s phone operations. While the accounting charge was on paper and will not diminish the company’s huge cash hoard, it was a psychic blow to Microsoft, one of the biggest money makers in tech. Investors, however, seemed to mostly look beyond Microsoft’s struggles in the phone market. They appeared to focus on two of the company’s most important businesses, Windows and Office, which showed some signs of weakness. Those were somewhat offset by strong growth in its cloud services business, Xbox games and Surface tablets. For its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended June 30, Microsoft said its net loss was $3.2 billion, or 40 cents a share, compared with net income of $4.61 billion, or 55 cents a share, during the same period last year. While the company’s stumbles in smartphones have shown the bruising downsides of the hardware business for Microsoft, it had success with other devices, including its Surface tablet, the revenue from which grew 117 percent, to $888 million. Revenue from its Xbox game business rose 27 percent. In total, Microsoft said it had nearly $2 billion in computing and gaming hardware revenue in the quarter. Revenue from Microsoft’s overall commercial cloud business grew 88 percent during the quarter, one of the brightest spots in its results. Microsoft’s shares fell about 4 percent in after-hours trading\\n\\nYahoo Posts Loss, Despite Rise in Its Display Ad Business:\\xa0Yahoo’s revenue in the second quarter rose 15 percent, the company said on Tuesday. But it spent heavily to achieve the gains, wiping out all of its profits and then some. For the quarter, Yahoo reported revenue of $1.24 billion, up 15 percent from the $1.08 billion it reported in the same quarter last year. But after deducting the share paid to partners, revenue was flat. The company posted a net loss of $22 million, or 2 cents a share, compared with the profit of $270 million, or 26 cents a share, it reported a year ago. Executives also warned that expenses would continue to be high through the rest of the year. “We are investing heavily to grow market share through traffic acquisition,” Marissa Mayer, Yahoo’s chief executive, said in a conference call with investors to discuss the results. Yahoo shareholders were unimpressed, sending the company’s stock down more than 1 percent in after-hours trading. Not that Yahoo’s core business — selling advertising — matters much to investors right now. Wall Street is far more interested in the fate of the company’s 15 percent stake in Alibaba, China’s biggest e-commerce company. Yahoo plans to spin off the holdings, worth more than $30 billion, into a separate company called Aabaco Holdings in the fourth quarter. The deal is designed to avoid incurring a capital-gains tax bill, but Wall Street analysts are concerned that the Internal Revenue Service will reject Yahoo’s argument that the spinoff should be tax-free.\\n\\nTargeted ads to drive mobile video business, Verizon CFO says:\\xa0Verizon Communications Inc \\'s upcoming mobile video service will drive revenue with a combination of highly targeted ads, exclusive content and pay-per-view live concerts and sporting events, Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in an interview on Tuesday. Most Americans own a mobile phone and Verizon is looking at offering video content to increase data consumption on mobile devices and grow revenue. The digital video service, which it expects to release this summer, is aimed at families and younger viewers who increasingly view content on mobile devices. The video service will be offered through a mobile app, and will include some free sponsored content, Shammo said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere is an MP3 version of this snippet\\n\\n\\nAhead of Earnings, Amazon Surges on Confidence Over Cloud, Spending Discipline:\\xa0Amazon.com’s shares reached another record, three days before the company’s earnings report, as investors expected upbeat results from the fast-growing cloud-computing business, a boost in sales from last week’s Prime Day promotion and signs that the company is controlling spending. The stock set records three days last week and is up 12 percent this month. The Seattle-based online retailer reports earnings Thursday. Analysts on average project earnings of $364 million on sales of $22.4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares’ advance shows renewed faith that Amazon can boost profit margins despite Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos’s history of sacrificing short-term earnings to invest in growth. A year ago, the company’s shares tumbled almost 10 percent the day after reporting a $126 million quarterly loss, hurt by a surge in spending on such items as its new Fire smartphone. This year, the company has invested in online entertainment and same-day delivery in big cities, increasing the allure of a $99 annual membership in Amazon Prime. Investors see such investments -- rather than on hardware -- as a sign of greater discipline. Amazon this year also began reporting results for its Amazon Web Services cloud-computing division, revealing a fast-growing and profitable enterprise to complement the core retailing business. The inaugural Prime Day promotion helped boost memberships, which will increase revenue through the year, said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. Amazon Prime members spend significantly more than nonsubscribers. He estimated that Prime Day added about $500 million in new third-quarter sales. Pachter issued a report on Sunday encouraging investors to buy Amazon shares in advance of earnings, in part citing the company’s cloud-computing operation. “Amazon Web Services has a much higher profit than anyone thought, and we know it’s growing at a ridiculously fast rate,” he wrote.\\n\\nIBM Drops After Revenue Declines for 13th Straight Quarter:\\xa0IBM fell after reporting second-quarter sales declines across all of its major business units, missing analysts’ estimates and marking the 13th straight period of falling revenue. “Investors are losing patience given the revenue miss,” said Bill Kreher, an analyst at Edward Jones “It’s a show-me stock.” IBM, based in Armonk, New York, fell as much as 5.3 percent to $164.01 in late trading. The stock has lost about 10 percent in the past year. Total revenue fell 13 percent from a year earlier to $20.8 billion, or a 1 percent decline adjusting for currency impact. Analysts estimated $20.9 billion on average. The company said it cut total expenses by 7.9 percent from the year-earlier period. Last quarter, IBM said full-year earnings would greatly hinge on its software business, which saw a sales decline of 10 percent in the second quarter, or a 3 percent decrease when excluding currency impact. The hardware business’ sales fell 32 percent as reported.\\n\\nJD.com launches online store to sell U.S. brands in China:\\xa0JD.com Inc, the no. 2 Chinese e-commerce company, said it would start selling U.S. products to customers in China through a new store on its website, as it looks to battle competition from bigger rival Alibaba. Both companies have recently started exclusive stores that offer products from countries including Japan, France, South Korea and Australia. JD.com also said on Monday that it would be the first authorized seller of Taylor Swift merchandise in China, which will include a line of clothes designed by the singer exclusively for JD.com customers. JD.com said the \"U.S. Mall\" would feature American brands such as Converse, Samsonite, and major apparel labels that are part of the Global Brands Group, including Nautica Kids and Jeep apparel. JD.com\\'s U.S.-listed shares were little changed at $35.39 on the Nasdaq. Up to Friday\\'s close, the stock had gained about 53 percent this year.\\n\\nEBay Reports Sale of Enterprise Unit as Earnings Beat Estimates:\\xa0EBay is sailing into the split of its two businesses — PayPal payments and its online marketplace — with a reassuring show of strength as its second-quarter financial performance surpassed Wall Street forecasts. With its PayPal business to be spun off at the end of this week, eBay also did some last-minute corporate cleanup Thursday morning. The company announced that it was selling its eBay Enterprise unit, which handles warehousing and logistics for third-party sellers, for $925 million to an investors consortium led by two private equity firms, Permira and Sterling Partners. Both eBay’s profits and revenue were better than expected, after taking into account the sale of its warehouse and logistics arm. Shares in eBay, which reported its results before the stock market opened, were up about 3 percent in midday trading. The company’s revenue increased 7 percent from the year-earlier quarter to $4.38 billion. The reported revenue fell short of analysts’ average estimate of $4.49 billion. In the quarter, eBay pulled out the revenue from eBay Enterprise. If included, total revenue would have been $4.65 billion, above Wall Street forecasts. The split-up strategy is the byproduct of a drawn-out proxy fight with Carl C. Icahn, an activist investor, who advocated a PayPal spinoff. His pressure and logic prevailed, and the company declared in September that it planned to break itself up.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an MP3 version of this snippet\\n\\n\\nApple Waits as App Developers Study Who’s Buying Its Watch:\\xa0In the months surrounding the much-ballyhooed release of the Apple Watch, Apple managers courted Facebook in the hopes that the social networking giant would make a software application for the new gadget. Facebook was not persuaded. Three months after the watch’s release, there is no Facebook app tailored for it. Adam Mosseri, who oversees Facebook’s news feed, said the social network had been studying the Apple Watch but had not figured out how to deliver a good Facebook experience — including the news feed’s stream of posts, photos and videos — on such a small screen. The lack of support from Facebook — and from other popular app makers like Snapchat and Google, which also do not have apps for Apple Watch — underscores the skepticism that remains in the technology community about the wearable device. That puts the watch, Apple’s first new product since the iPad in 2010, in something of a Catch-22: The companies whose apps would most likely prompt more people to buy the device are waiting to see who is buying it and how they use it. Another challenge with the Apple Watch software system is that apps have to process all the data on the iPhone and then beam it to the watch, limiting what the Apple Watch apps can do. The next version of the software, which will be released in the fall, will remedy this by letting developers write apps that run directly on the watch, relying on the iPhone mostly for the Internet connection. That doesn’t mean the Apple Watch lacks apps. Apple released the device in April with more than 3,000 apps — far more than the 500 that were available for the iPhone when the App Store opened in 2008. Yet only five of the 20 most popular free iPhone apps in the United States have versions for the Apple Watch, according to data from App Annie, an analytics firm. And the number of apps for the watch, which now stands at about 7,400, is growing at a slower rate than the explosive uptick of apps that were produced for iPhones and iPads in their early days. While the number of apps for the watch jumped 142 percent in the first three months, that compared to 437 percent for the iPhone and 200 percent for the iPad, according to data provided by App Annie.\\n\\nTesla Offers New ‘Ludicrous Mode’: Zero to 60 in 2.8 Seconds:\\xa0Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk introduced a new “Ludicrous Mode” for the dual-motor version of the Model S during a call on Friday, allowing the all-electric sedan to go from zero to 60 miles per hour in 2.8 seconds. The upgrade costs an additional $10,000 for new buyers and results in a 10 percent acceleration improvement. The hold music before the conference call began was a loop of the rap song Beast Mode by Ludacris. Tesla will also offer Ludicrous Mode for its coming Model X SUV, which will probably clock in at zero to 60 mph in 3.3 seconds, according to Musk. “We haven’t tested it yet, so that’s just a guess,” he said. “That’s mad for an SUV, obviously.” Here’s how Tesla squeezed out the extra juice to go from insane to ludicrous. The limiting factor for acceleration during the first 30 mph is traction—basically getting the wheels to stay connected to earth. Tesla had already solved that engineering roadblock. The limiting factor when accelerating from 30 mph to 60 mph, on the other hand, is pulling enough current from the battery pack.\\n\\nGoogle Adds a Record $60 Billion to Its Stock in One Day:\\xa0The search-engine giant added $65 billion to its market capitalization today, more than the size of Hewlett-Packard Co. The surge, following earnings that topped analyst estimates, is the biggest one-day gain in value ever for a U.S. company, according to data compiled by Standard and Poor\\'s Dow Jones Indices. Apple held the previous record, with a $46.4 billion surge in April 2012. Google’s rally pushed the Mountain View, California-based company further ahead of Microsoft Corp. in rankings of the world’s biggest companies, sending its value to about $468 billion compared with the software giant’s $377 billion. The shares are up 26 percent in five days, the biggest one-week advance since it went public in 2004. Thursday’s report marked the first time since 2013 that Google has announced quarterly adjusted earnings per share higher than expectations. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, who joined the company in May, also signaled plans to bring more restraint to spending at the Internet search giant.\\n\\nEtsy Surges Most Since IPO on Mention in Google Revenue Call:\\xa0Etsy surged the most since it went public, after Google said the online artisan marketplace is seeing a boost in traffic from mobile-search results. Etsy gained 31 percent to $21.98 at the close in New York, the biggest climb since its IPO on April 16. The shares had increased 5.2 percent from the stock’s debut through Thursday’s close. Brooklyn-based Etsy, a platform where sellers offer homemade and vintage items ranging from jewelry to wall art, has been trying to boost sales after its first-quarter net loss widened. Google’s “deep links,” which redirect users to mobile applications when they click results from a Web search, could help Etsy lure more shoppers to its marketplace.“Developers like Etsy are already seeing a boost in traffic as a result of deep linking,” Omid Kordestani, Google’s chief business officer, said on an earnings phone call Thursday. Etsy’s sudden spike may be creating what’s called a short squeeze -- meaning traders who were betting against the company have to cover their positions at the higher price, leading to swings in the stock.\\n\\nChina central bank issues guidelines on internet finance development:\\xa0The central bank called on the government to support internet firms in setting up platforms for expenditures and loans, crowdfunding, the sale of financial products and other financing platforms. It called for broadening channels of financing and supporting private investment funds to back the internet finance industry. The bank also recommended tax breaks for qualifying small enterprises including start-ups, saying that provincial level governments should increase their support for those companies.\\n\\nIndian PC market dips as smartphone, tablet sales rise:\\xa0PC market in the country has declined for the first time to 10.6 million units, falling over 10 per cent, on account of growing consumer preference for smartphones and tablets, industry body MAIT today said. According to MAIT-IMRB report, desktop and notebook market cumulatively stood at 11.8 million units in 2013-14. Smartphone market in 2014-15 grew 33 per cent to 69.6 million units, while phablets and tablets grew 527 per cent (50.8 million) and four per cent (3.4 million units) respectively. In revenue terms, the PC market declined to Rs 21,058 crore in 2014-15 from Rs 25,117 crore in the previous fiscal. For smartphones and tablets, the revenue was up 88 per cent to over Rs 65,815 crore in 2014-15 from Rs 34,900 crore a year ago. “The growth is expected to continue in 2015-16 with smartphones expected to grow 27 per cent, phablets 65 per cent and tablets 16 per cent,” he said. During the year 2014-15, server sales registered a growth of 30 per cent over the last financial year at 1,82,727 units. The overall size of Indian ICT hardware market, which comprises printers, servers and computers among others, stood at USD 15.87 billion, showing a growth of 23.98 per cent over the previous year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an MP3 version of this snippet\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle Shares Rise 11% as CFO Porat Signals She’ll Rein In Spending:\\xa0In the first earnings report for Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer Google lured from Morgan Stanley, Ms. Porat said the company was keeping a closer eye on costs. “People are realizing it’s a new era,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial LP. “She’s coming in and she’s expressing what investors wanted -- that’s there’s going to be cost rationalization, a degree of discipline.” The numbers backed her up, with revenue and profits outpacing the expectations of Wall Street. The company reported that revenue rose 11 percent to $17.7 billion from a year earlier, with net revenue — a figure that excludes payments to advertising partners — increasing to $14.35 billion. That was above the $14.28 billion projected by analysts, according to Bloomberg. Google said that absent currency fluctuations, overall revenue would have risen 18 percent from a year ago. Google’s cash pile swelled to $70 billion in the second quarter. In the recent quarter, the number of clicks on ads rose 18 percent, compared with a 13 percent increase in the first quarter, while the average cost per click fell 11 percent after dropping 7 percent in the prior period. Google’s mobile cost-per-click is climbing, helping to close the gap with desktop ads, Porat said on the call. Watch time on YouTube, the company’s video-sharing site, was up 60 percent, with mobile watch time more than doubling, she said. The slower growth in costs, along with suggestions from Ms. Porat that Google will try to be more forthcoming with investors — and may be open to redistributing some of the company’s cash pile down the line — suggested a new era of cooperation from a company that has historically had an antagonistic relationship with Wall Street. She confirmed that they are more open to focusing on expense controls, more open to providing new disclosures and more open to potentially returning cash,” said Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie Securities. “Those are the three things people wanted, and she came through.” Analysts like Mr. Schachter were impressed by her investor-friendly tone, and Google shares jumped nearly 11 percent in after-hours trading.\\n\\nThe surprising way smartphones are changing the way we shop:\\xa0Smartphones and tablets now account for up to 68 percent of the traffic to the videogame chain’s Web site, where customers are frequently browsing products and looking up trade-in values for their old games. One thing they’re not doing much of on mobile devices? Buying stuff. In fact, “purchasing through that phone probably wouldn’t even make the top ten list of engagement activities that they do,” said Jason Allen, the retailer’s vice president of multichannel. “We’re not overly focused on conversion on mobile, we really see it as a tool to drive traffic in our stores” This reflects a trend seen throughout the industry: While there has been a surge in traffic to retailers\\' Web sites from smartphones, a proportionately big boom in sales on these gadgets have yet to appear. In other words, for all the time we spend swiping and tapping on our phones, we still aren’t especially willing to make purchases on them. At Kohl’s, executives say they have spent the last year and a half updating their app, in part to accommodate an in-store shopper who is more frequently searching for product reviews, watching video content about merchandise and sharing their finds on social media. When customers are in Kohl’s stores and on the retailer’s Wifi network, customers spend more time on the app than when they’re not in the store, company officials said. These behaviors have led Kohl’s to develop a new “in-store mode” for its app, in which users who walk into a Kohl’s store will be asked if they want to use a special version that is tailored for wandering the store. Kohl’s declined to say how the in-store mode will be different from its regular app experience, but said it would be available in September. Big-box behemoth Target is also catering to shoppers who are using their phone to guide them through stores with a relaunched app that has a stronger emphasis on a tool that helps them building their weekly shopping list and an interactive map of each store in its fleet. It’s easy to see why the company has moved in this direction: Since it installed free WiFi in its stores a few years ago, Target has found that the most-visited site, by far, is the retailer’s own Web site. This enthusiastic embrace of in-store phone use might have seemed unthinkable in corners of the retail industry only a few years ago, when many brick-and-mortar chains were panicking about showrooming, the industry term for when shoppers would go to a store to check out merchandise, only to ultimately buy it online for a better price. But that fear has largely dissipated as study after study has shown showrooming is not a huge threat. In fact, several studies have found that the opposite behavior -- browsing online before buying in a physical store -- is more common.\\n\\nAs Google and Microsoft push app developers to reveal their content, coders balk at making apps searchable:\\xa0The giants of the Web have been pressing developers of mobile apps to index their content so it can be parsed by search engines or linked to from other sites. That’s already possible with most Web pages, thanks to pieces of embedded code known as deep links. Imagine a future in which a Google search for a “tulle mini” would call up results from Wish, a fashion app, along with links to e-commerce sites. A Facebook user who wanted to share a recipe for vegan chocolate chip cookies from the Yummly app would be able to post a link that would take viewers to the relevant page instead of forcing them to download the app first. So far, the effort has been a bit like herding cats: Only a few thousand apps—a tiny fraction of the millions out there—have adopted the competing tech protocols that Google, Facebook, Apple, and others are pushing. Google’s pitch to developers is that deep links benefit them by driving more traffic to their apps. The company says traffic on the Yellow Pages and Etsy apps increased by 8 percent and 12 percent, respectively, after they began using Google’s indexing. Rajan Patel, a principal engineer at Google, says more than 1,000 apps—mainly those designed for its Android mobile operating system but also some for Apple’s iOS—use its deep linking. “To us, the main advantage that we see coming from this is removing friction—not having to find the app on your phone and fire it up,” says Atul Kakkar, principal product manager at Eventbrite, a website that helps people publicize and sell tickets to yoga classes, tech conferences, and other happenings. The company plans to start indexing its app to enable Google searches. Some developers have resisted using deep links because it’s costly and laborious to create separate code for each mobile platform. (Android and iOS are the predominant ones.) Inserting the links eats up as much as 5 percent of the time it takes developers to build an app, says Alex Matjanec, managing partner at AD:60, a New York-based ad agency that creates apps for clients.\\n\\nYouTube\\'s Top Advertisers Increased Their Spending by 60% in Q2:\\xa0Google\\'s second quarter earnings report today, the tech giant revealed that YouTube viewership is growing faster than it has in two years, and advertiser money is following. YouTube\\'s mobile users averaged 40 minutes per session during Q2, which represents a 50 percent increase year over year while ultimately helping the Mountain View, Calif.-based player beat Wall Street expectations. The number of advertisers rose 40 percent year over year on the video platform, while the average spend of YouTube\\'s top 100 advertisers rose 60 percent. Google does not break out how much revenue YouTube generates, but executives were clearly satisfied with the performance. There are more 18- to-49-year-olds on YouTube than there are consumers who watch cable TV, Porat said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an MP3 version of this snippet\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle Unveils Buy Button on Ads in Mobile-Commerce Push, Ties Up With Flipkart, Ebay on Deep Links:\\xa0Google Inc. is testing a feature to let consumers purchase products by clicking through advertisements, seeking to expand options for mobile retail sales. The Internet-search company’s service, Purchases on Google, will let people using smartphones click on select search ads that take the users directly to a retailer-branded product page hosted by Google, according to an e-mail. The tools will work with a “limited number of retailers” for now, the company said. The company also announced an effort to alert smartphone users to information such as sales and loyalty programs at nearby stores, through its Google Now program. Google is expanding information on product ratings in ads and giving users more data on local inventory, as well. The Mountain View, California-based company will make it simpler for ads to drive consumers to shopping apps, rather than to retailer’s websites. EBay and Flipkart, an e-commerce site based in India, are among the early partners in the initiative, which uses a technology called deep links.\\n\\nFacebook Adds Buy Button Integration As It Continues To Reinvent Pages:\\xa0It’s been over a year since Facebook started testing its buy button in ads on the newsfeed, and it appears that the company is now ready to take the service to its next logical progression with dedicated shops on Pages where users can browse for and purchase items. This is a pretty major step in Facebook’s marked plans to take over ecommerce and turn pages into destinations where users can go to grab the information they need and make quick orders. With Facebook’s recent efforts of adding business hours and OpenTable integrations, it’s clear that the shop feature is the next step towards making Pages a more visible part of the user experience. The newsfeed has dominated how users have absorbed information from businesses on Facebook for the past decade. Now, it seems the company is ready to revitalize Facebook Pages and transform them into commerce destinations where users can not only quickly grab business info, but as of today, also buy stuff. Today, Facebook made a pretty clear statement that Pages is shifting to become a major priority for them in terms of user traffic. BuzzFeed reported that the company had recently started testing shops with ‘buy buttons’ inside of Facebook Pages.\\n\\nMore Fizzle Than Sizzle on Amazon’s Prime Day:\\xa0Has Amazon Prime Day been everything it was advertised to be? The reaction online at the halfway mark has been less than effusive, with the Twitter hashtag #PrimeDayFail gaining traction Wednesday alongside complaints of lackluster merchandise, paltry discounts and all-around disappointment. The day seemed to start with excitement. But shoppers were quickly grumbling about a less-than-stellar lineup. Others were underwhelmed by the discounts. Clunky navigation on Amazon was an issue. When the deals were good, shoppers reported being put on endless wait lists. Some shoppers even said their Prime Day experience drove them to other shopping sites, including Walmart. An Amazon spokeswoman said the much-deplored, confusing “Join wait list” button simply meant that all available discounts had been placed in customers’ carts. But if those customers didn’t complete their purchases within 15 minutes, that discount was passed on to the next customer in line. The wait list, she said, often allowed Amazon to secure more inventory. After long wait lists for Bose headphones on Wednesday morning, Amazon added more units to the sale, she said.\\n\\nNetflix Posts Mixed Results, but New Memberships Surge - Shares up 10% on Earnings:\\xa0These are heady times for Netflix. On Wednesday, investors even looked past a 63 percent drop in second-quarter profits to send shares in Netflix surging nearly 10 percent in after-hours trading, on news that it added a record 3.3 million global streaming members during the second quarter, eclipsing expectations. There are reasons for caution. The big falloff in net income Netflix reported on Wednesday underscored the huge level of investment required to execute its strategy of pressing deeper into original programming and aggressively moving overseas. Netflix has warned investors that it doesn’t expect to break even globally until the end of 2016. The company has said that it will deliver material global profits after that period of expansion. Total revenue was $1.6 billion in the second quarter, up 23 percent from the period last year.\\n\\nIntel Earnings Surpass Forecasts, Driven by Data Centers:\\xa0Overall for the second quarter, Intel reported net income of $2.7 billion, or 55 cents a share. That was down $100 million from a year earlier, but was the same in per-share terms because Intel has bought back a lot of its stock. Net income was also lifted by a lower tax rate. Revenue fell 5 percent, to $13.2 billion. Intel has been working on making a new future for itself by investing more in chips for data centers and Internet-connected products for industry — and some of those investments are paying off. Sales of chips for data centers rose 10 percent from a year earlier. In total, data center, Internet of Things and high-level memory chip sales were 40 percent of revenue and 70 percent of profits. Intel reported on Wednesday that second-quarter revenue from chips for PCs fell 14 percent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an MP3 version of this snippet\\n\\n\\nFoxconn Starts Manufacturing Smartphones in India Amid Modi Push:\\xa0Foxconn Technology Group started making its first smartphones in India as part of the Taiwanese company’s plan to expand in the South Asian nation. Production has started in Andhra Pradesh state in the nation’s south east, Foxconn spokesman Louis Woo said, declining to comment further. Models for clients Xiaomi Corp. and InFocus Inc. have started shipping from a facility in Sri City according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because it’s not been officially announced. Foxconn is looking to expand in India amid Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s drive to boost manufacturing in Asia’s third-largest economy. Billionaire chairman Terry Gou, whose business empire gets half its revenue from Apple expects to open as many as 12 factories and create one million jobs in India by 2020, Foxconn said in a statement citing Gou. FIH Mobile, Foxconn’s phone manufacturing unit, expects to have multiple manufacturing sites in India, with none employing more than 10,000 people, the company said in May.\\n\\nElaborate Hoax Sends Twitter Shares up 8% on Takeover Rumors - Until Story Confirmed False:\\xa0A report claiming that Twitter received an offer to be acquired for $31 billion attributed to Bloomberg LP is fake, Twitter and a spokesman for the news and financial data provider said on Tuesday. Twitter shares jumped on the report, which was distributed on the Internet and closely resembled Bloomberg\\'s news website. Its origins could not be immediately established. Cybersecurity experts said the fake website and report did not require a high level of skill. The domain name was registered anonymously and it may take months for authorities to determine who created the site. The report appeared on a site named bloomberg.market, rather than bloomberg.com. The bloomberg.market account was suspended at mid-afternoon Tuesday. The website carrying the false report was registered on July 10, according to a domain search on the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. The domain was registered in Panama to WhoIsGuard, a company which puts its own information as a web site registrant to mask the identity of the actual owner. Twitter options were heavily traded on Tuesday with overall options activity surging to 330,000 contracts, or more than twice normal volume, according to Trade Alert data. A large buyer appears to have bought 12,000 near-dated call options across multiple strikes at 11:37 am ET as the fake report went out and the shares started rising. Calls betting on shares rising above $37 by Friday were bought across multiple exchanges. \"If I am an attorney at the SEC, I want to contact that person to ask about the reasoning behind the large positioning in the short-dated contracts,” said Steven Spencer, partner at proprietary trading firm SMB Capital in New York. Twitter ended the session up 0.9 percent at $36.72. Earlier, it jumped as much as 8.5 percent.\\n\\nUber having trouble raising China fund, expects to lose $3B over next 3 years, says report in rival-backed tech site:\\xa0On Tuesday, a report emerged on Chinese tech news site Sina Tech citing a “source close to Uber” as saying that the company has had trouble finding first-tier Chinese investors. Uber has reportedly asked Goldman Sachs for help with finding Chinese investors (a technique it has used before) but the company has thusfar been met with mostly rejections from top-tier Chinese and Asian investors. According to Sina Tech’s anonymous source, when Uber first started looking for investors, it wasn’t giving out detailed financial information about its China business beyond the somewhat questionable one-million-rides-a-day number it “leaked” earlier this summer. But when investors balked at the lack of information, Uber was forced to cough up more, and those numbers apparently don’t look great. Uber reportedly expects to do US$1.1 billion in total sales in China in 2015, but it also expects to post losses of US$1.1 billion there this year. Over the next three years, Uber apparently expects its China business to lose $3 billion. Any report in the Chinese tech press that cites only anonymous sources is worth taking with a grain of salt, of course. And Sina Tech’s parent company Sina, through its Sina Weibo subsidiary, does own a share in Uber rival Didi Kuaidi, so “black PR” certainly can’t be ruled out. But it does seem odd that Uber still hasn’t announced its funding round despite having reportedly nabbed one of Didi Kuaidi’s top investors weeks ago.\\n\\nGoogle Takes on Apple With Smartphone Location Tracking Tools:\\xa0Google is stepping up efforts against Apple’s location technology with new tools to link smartphones to nearby objects. The search giant on Tuesday introduced a new format called Eddystone that lets electronic beacons provide more specific locations and other information within applications, the company said in a blog post. The tools, which compete with Apple’s iBeacon technology, will enable smartphone users at a museum, for example, to get more information on a painting they’re looking at or to gain easy access to electronic bus tickets when they’re near a bus stop. Apple rolled out iBeacon in 2013. Using a low-energy Bluetooth signal, the software makes an iPhone’s proximity to certain items easier to track with the help of $10 signaling device beacons mounted on shelves and ceilings, each no bigger than a hockey puck. Other providers also have introduced location technology. Google’s Eddystone will be open to other platforms and has features that work on Android and the iPhone, the company said. Also, the company wants to integrate the system in its Google Now service, which gives users contextual information around them before they need to search for it.\\n\\nMeet Miip, the Ad Monkey in Your App, From InMobi:\\xa0Naveen Tewari, chief executive of InMobi, thinks the 1.2 billion people who see ads served by his company’s mobile ad network are tired of being bombarded with generally irrelevant marketing messages. He says advertising should be friendly, more tour guide than tout, and help people discover new products and services that they actually want to buy. To test that proposition, InMobi has developed Miip, an animated monkey character that follows you from app to app, watches what you’re doing and suggests products that you might want to buy. The Indian company unveiled the technology at an event in San Francisco on Tuesday evening. The idea is that instead of seeing a regular ad in your app, Miip would appear, with a text bubble inviting you to check out products from advertisers that it thinks are relevant. If you’re playing classic rock on an app like Spotify, for example, Miip might suggest a Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd T-shirt and offer you the option to buy it right from the app. Over time, if the monkey makes smart suggestions, the company hopes, you will be more inclined to click on it when you see it pop up in other apps and perhaps even take the time to tell it what kinds of things you most want to see. InMobi has been quietly testing Miip (pronounced Meep) for six months, trying it with about 5 million users. Early advertisers include the streaming music service Spotify, the travel agents Expedia and Orbitz, niche retailers like Joyus and TheRealReal, and several major American retailers that weren’t willing to publicly disclose their involvement. The Miip ads will begin appearing in 40,000 apps on Wednesday, and InMobi hopes to eventually convert most of the 200 million ads served by its network each month to the format.\\n\\nAs tech firms track your location, advertisers zero in for the sale:\\xa0In recent years, major retailers have restricted mobile to 10 percent or less of their ad budgets because of difficulty gauging their effectiveness and a limited ability to target shoppers by location. Targeting is now much easier, to the extent that a consumer walking past a given retail outlet can receive ads in his or her Facebook or Google app showcasing some particular product available at that store - perhaps offering a discount coupon to lure them inside. That is a tantalizing prospect for companies if it leads to actual sales. For Facebook and Google there are early signs the new technology is already paying off. Six advertising firm executives representing more than 50 clients combined, told Reuters in interviews that clients have invested significantly more since the holiday season in mobile ads as a result of this new technology. In some cases, these advertisers, including major retailers they declined to name, are investing up to 40 percent of their advertising budgets on mobile ads, four times as much as at the end of last year. Facebook and Google are widely considered to be at the forefront of this shift. Google claimed 37 percent of U.S. mobile ad revenue share in 2014 and Facebook had 18.5 percent, according to data from research firm eMarketer. Twitter, which had the third-largest share, was far behind with 3.6 percent of the share.\\n\\nProduct developers are preparing to offer a variety of items to consumers that will allow scent to become a part of digital messaging.:\\xa0This fall, the start-up Vapor Communications, for example, will introduce several devices to include subtle scents with books, movies and clothing. And the company will start mass production of its oPhone Duo, a tabletop device that can emit scents based on how an iPhone photo is labeled. Another company, Scentee, already has a scent product on the market. The product, also called Scentee, is a cartridge that plugs into a smartphone’s headphone jack. It can be set up with an app to emit a puff of fragrance when a text message or email arrives. Smells tended to linger and become muddled with other smells, but Vapor Communications says it has overcome that problem with a system that includes small plastic pellets with scents that are activated when air flows over them. The scent is not dispersed widely; users have to lean in close, as if sniffing a flower, to smell anything at all. All of the products depend on a small pellet called an oChip — the “o” in the product names is for olfactory. In the oPhone, each chip contains from one to four aromas. The chips are sold in packets of eight, grouped into “families” of similar smells, called Coffee, Foodie and Memory. A person who wants to describe the smell of a pasta sauce, for example, could choose notes of tomato, rosemary and parsley, which would then command the player to position those chips so the air would flow over them, combining the scents.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an MP3 version of this snippet\\n\\n\\n\\nBrands Hope You Like Them Enough to Pin Them at the Top of Your Facebook News Feed:\\xa0An update to Facebook\\'s news feed allows users to select a group of preferred friends, whose posts will always appear at the top of the home page. Facebook is billing the feature as an extra layer of personalization on top of what the news feed algorithm selects for users automatically, based on their behavior. In addition to selecting best friends, Facebook also gives users the ability to choose from the list of pages they\\'ve “Liked” for retail and consumer brands, news organizations, or interest groups. The ones that make the cut will also appear at the top of a user\\'s news feed, along with family and best buds. The feature gives hope to marketing executives who felt burned by an overcrowded news feed that meant even fans rarely saw their updates. Some companies had been paying Facebook to advertise their pages and increase “Likes,” an expense that made less sense if people weren\\'t seeing the posts. Now a user who designates pages as important will “see any new stories they’ve shared since your last visit to Facebook at the top of News Feed, with a star in the top right of their post so you know why they’re at the top,” according to Facebook. “You can scroll down to see the rest of your News Feed normally.”\\n\\nIn a Major Shift of Emphasis, Out-Gunned Rackspace Seeks Growth in Microsoft Cloud Partnership:\\xa0Rackspace Hosting will sell support services to customers running on Microsoft’s Internet-based Windows Azure service, in a major shift of emphasis for the cloud-computing company. The partnership announced Monday means people can pay the San Antonio, Texas-based company to set up, manage and support technology rented from Windows Azure, or for support services on top of their existing Microsoft cloud deployments. Rackspace will continue to operate its own web-hosting and cloud services supported by its data centers and will let customers mix and match their IT between the two companies’ facilities. The shift is part of a broader one for Rackspace as it seeks to make more money out of its support organization. Revenue growth slowed the past two years to about 17 percent annually and the company’s stock fell the most in eight months in May after it released a second-quarter sales forecast that was below analysts’ estimates. Rackspace support services will start at $1,500 per month, Engates said, and customers should save from 40 percent to 70 percent by using the company’s services rather than doing the same support tasks in-house. Microsoft is the first of multiple partners. Providing support services on top of Amazon.com Inc.’s market-leading Amazon Web Services cloud is “the headline” of the strategy, Pichler said. Larger cloud companies have outspent Rackspace on infrastructure for the best part of a decade. Microsoft spent $5.5 billion on capital expenditures in the fiscal year ended June 2014, compared with $435 million for Rackspace. The three companies each deploy millions of servers, versus the estimated 100,000 that Rackspace has under management. While Rackspace generated $1.79 billion in 2014 revenue, Amazon’s cloud subsidiary, for example, brought in $1.57 billion in its most recent quarter, up 49 percent from a year earlier.\\n\\nWal-Mart to Counterattack Amazon’s ‘Prime Day’ With Web Sale:\\xa0Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is cutting prices on thousands of products this week in a counterattack to Prime Day, an event Amazon.com Inc. is using to promote its subscription service. Wal-Mart will begin the sale on July 15, the same day as Amazon’s much-publicized promotion. During Prime Day, Amazon will offer special discounts to members of its service, which costs $99 a year. As part of the effort, Wal-Mart also is lowering its minimum purchase for free shipping to $35 from $50. The move marks an escalating battle between Wal-Mart’s e-commerce site and Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer. Wal-Mart also has been developing its own competitor to Prime that will cost $50 a year, half the cost. But it won’t have the same speed of delivery as Prime or some of the other perks, such as Amazon’s streaming video and music services. Wal-Mart’s promotion this week is separate from that push, and the deals are available to all customers. Fernando Madeira, president of Walmart.com, took a dig at Amazon in a blog post on Monday, saying that Wal-Mart’s discounts won’t just be for people who pay for a membership.\\n\\nShares of China\\'s ZTE set to rise over 30 percent on share buyback:\\xa0Shares of Chinese telecommunications equipment maker ZTE Corp were set to surge more than 30 percent in early Tuesday trade after the board approved an A-share buyback plan estimated at no more than 1 billion yuan ($161 million).\\n\\nUber resumes payments through credit card in India:\\xa0Beginning today, ride sharing app Uber Technologies Inc has resumed accepting credit card payments in India. Uber’s app has been tweaked for the two-factor authentication (2FA) flow that the Reserve Bank of India mandates for all card-based payments, the company said in a press statement. This feature is available to all Android users immediately and will be extended on the iOS platform in the coming weeks. Uber had stopped accepting payments through credit cards (issued in India) and debit cards seven months ago after it was pulled up by the RBI. As a safety measure, RBI requires all credit and debit card transactions to undergo a two-step process for honouring payments. Typically, a user swipes or enters the credit/debit card information in the first step and then has to enter a password in the second step. Uber followed only one-step authentication and directly billed users at the end of the ride, which fell foul of RBI rules. The San Francisco-based company had tied up with mobile wallet firm Paytm to sidestep the 2FA compliance requirement. Uber will continue to accept Paytm payments, it said.\\n\\nNetflix Hits A New All-Time High Ahead Of Its Stock Split And Q2 Earnings:\\xa0Netflix’s shares popped nearly four percent today to an all-time high of $707.61. The new record comes a day before the company splits its shares on a seven-for-one basis, and two days before it will report earnings. Shares in the online video streaming and content shop have been on a tear, roughly doubling so far this year. Netflix is now worth north of $40 billion. Driving the bull run in Netflix has been its share split, which has proved quite popular with investors, and recent strong analyst sentiment on the company. New price targets can sometimes move prices closer to targets, of course. At risk for Netflix is the heavy weight of high expectations. On the heels of its split, if Netflix borks its earnings, investors will be merciless. Also in the cards for Netflix is simply how richly it is valued. The company has, according to Yahoo Finance, a forward price-earnings ratio of more than 200. That implies that investors are quite willing to pay for tomorrow’s profits today when it comes to Big Red.\\n\\nAs Ad Tech consolidates, firms that could be acquisition targets: InMobi tops list:\\xa0AOL reportedly in talks to buy mobile ad network Millennial Media for $300 million to $350 million, which would let AOL sell ads within thousands of apps and give it access to more data and better targeting tools. But industry players said there are other mobile companies up for grabs. 1. InMobi is one of the first choices to replace Millennial on a list of lucrative, independent mobile players. Google supposedly had its eye on the India-based network earlier this year, but CEO Naveen Tewari claims he wants to keep the company independent. InMobi\\'s a bit bigger internationally than it is in the U.S., but it\\'s acquired companies like Overlay Media—a data scientist team that zeroes in on targeting—to build up its ad offerings. Verve, xAd and NinthDecimal all put a different spin on working the location data that bounces off of phones for advertisers. Sam Bloom, general manager of interactive at Camelot, contended that the players risk being outpaced as digital powerhouses Facebook, Google and Yahoo build their own geo-targeting technology. \"My sense is some of these [smaller] guys will just crumble,\" Bloom said. \"While [location has] been unique for a period of time, I don\\'t think that\\'s the case any longer. Over time, the smaller guys will get beat because the bigger guys have bigger sales forces.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",
      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\nEllen Pao resigns as Reddit chief executive:\\xa0Ellen Pao has resigned as interim chief executive of Reddit, the popular online message board, following widespread user criticism of the way she was running the company. Reddit announced the change Friday afternoon in a company post, saying that the resignation was \"by mutual agreement.\" Pao will be replaced by Steve Huffman, Reddit\\'s co-founder and original chief executive. Pao, who had been at the company only eight months, came under withering criticism for firing a popular employee, Victoria Taylor, the company’s director of talent. Taylor was beloved among Reddit\\'s powerful moderators, who don\\'t work for the company but have complete editorial control over the thousands of niche discussion sections on virtually every topic, including cute animals and depression. Reddit\\'s message boards draw about 160 million active users. Taylor was also a rare, public female face at Reddit and in tech world. Amid the vitriol directed at Pao, many users pointed out the irony that Pao would have let go a prominent woman at Reddit right after losing a bruising, high-profile gender discrimination suit earlier this year. After Taylor\\'s dismissal, moderators revolted, shutting public access to hundreds of discussion boards over several days. Users also circulated an online petition, that has gathered more than 200,000 signatures, calling for Pao to step down. Pao posted an apology this week for the way the Taylor firing was handled. On Friday, she released a statement on Reddit saying that she resigned because \"the board asked me to demonstrate higher user growth in the next six months than I believe I can deliver while maintaining reddit’s core principles.\"\\n\\nCarmakers to tech partners: Keep your hands off our data:\\xa0Carmakers are limiting the data they share with technology partners Apple and Google through new systems that link smartphones to vehicle infotainment systems, defending access to information about what drivers do in their cars. Auto companies hope that the vehicle data will one day generate billions of dollars in e-commerce, though they are just beginning to form strategies for monetizing the information. Apple and Google already make money from smartphone owners by providing a variety of products and services, from digital music to targeted advertising, and connecting phones to car systems will almost certainly extend their reach. But as infotainment systems such as Apple\\'s CarPlay and Google\\'s Android Auto become more widespread, auto companies hope to keep tech providers from gaining access to a wealth of potentially profitable information collected by computer systems in cars. Some auto companies have specifically said they will not provide Apple and Google with data from the vehicle\\'s functional systems - steering, brakes and throttle, for instance - as well as information about range, a measure of how far the car can travel before it runs out of gas. Auto companies hope to profit from in-vehicle data in a variety of ways, including the provision of travel planning services and auto repair and service information they hope will bring drivers to dealerships. They also expect to work with insurance companies, providing information that would allow insurers to base their rates on a driver\\'s behavior behind the wheel.\\n\\nAcross Asia, investments in technology start-ups have risen to levels comparable to the United States.:\\xa0In the first six months of this year, 46 Asian start-ups, including Apus, have had fund-raising rounds of $100 million or more, just short of the 48 in North America, according to the research firm CB Insights. The focus of investors in Asia — China and India in particular — reflects an increasingly decentralized reality in global technology investment. Asian banks, private equity firms, venture capital funds and hardware and Internet giants are all willing to invest in domestic start-ups. And American investors are increasingly willing to back Asian players with advantages in their home markets. China and India have two of the world’s largest smartphone markets, and investors are particularly interested in finding ways to make money from these giants. Small hardware companies that use their knowledge of China’s electronics supply chain to make sensors and novel devices like drones are also drawing attention — realms of technology not yet dominated by the current power players in the industry, namely Apple, Google and Microsoft. In India, the two largest investments were made by the American hedge fund Tiger Global Management and the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. Alibaba and its finance affiliate Ant Financial invested $575 million in the Indian mobile commerce company One97, while Tiger made a $500 million investment in India’s leading e-commerce site, Flipkart. Tiger Global has yet to make an investment in the United States this year and has focused 82 percent of its new investments in India at companies in their early stages, according to a June report from CB Insights. “India is one of the youngest countries, and their mobile penetration is low,” said Michael Dempsey, an analyst for CB Insights. “With more than a billion people, why wouldn’t it be one of the next major tech hubs? That’s what investors are thinking.”\\n\\nCan SoundCloud Be the Facebook of Music?:\\xa0SoundCloud has 150 million registered users, up from 10 million in 2011, and claims 175 million total listeners a month. According to ComScore, its traffic across desktop and mobile rose 14 percent in May from a year earlier, and 142 percent from two years ago. The audience skews younger than Spotify’s and Pandora’s. While SoundCloud has become a familiar feature of the digital landscape, it’s barely registered in most coverage of the Grand Streaming Wars of 2015, in which Apple Music, Spotify, Pandora Media, and others scrap for earshare. Then again, 8-year-old SoundCloud has a different mission. Its content is a creator-driven free-for-all: Anybody can upload a song (or other audio) and use SoundCloud’s tools to get it out there. Aspiring musicians, mainstream artists, DJs, podcasters, and others have uploaded 100-million-plus tracks and clips, creating a YouTube-like sprawl of unpredictable content.For listeners, SoundCloud is less like a music collection or radio station than an audio-based social network.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an MP3 version of this snippet\\n\\n\\nFacebook Redefines \\'Clicks\\' In Significant Changes to Pricing Model on Online Ads:\\xa0Facebook is redefining the term “click” to appease its many advertisers. The social network will no longer charge marketers for what are known as engagement clicks — things such as “Likes,” comments or shares of an ad. Instead, Facebook will only count a click that generates a desired result for a marketer, like a website visit or an app install. The change comes just a few weeks after Facebook also changed up its definition for video “views.” Essentially, it’s responding to advertisers that aren’t interested in paying for someone to “Like” their advertisement when they would rather have an app install instead. These clicks are typically more expensive, but Facebook argues that they are also more valuable. It’s a new approach for Facebook but not a new approach for the industry. Twitter started testing this kind of ad — called direct response ads — almost a year ago and rolled them out to all advertisers at the end of May. It’s clear that advertisers want this model; Facebook and Twitter wouldn’t change things up unless advertisers were clamoring for it.\\n\\nIBM Discloses Working Version of a Much Higher-Capacity Chip:\\xa0IBM said on Thursday that it had made working versions of ultradense computer chips, with roughly four times the capacity of today’s most powerful chips. The development lifts a bit of the cloud that has fallen over the semiconductor industry, which has struggled to maintain its legendary pace of doubling transistor density every two years. Intel, which for decades has been the industry leader, has faced technical challenges in recent years. Moreover, technologists have begun to question whether the longstanding pace of chip improvement, known as Moore’s Law, would continue past the current 14-nanometer generation of chips. Each generation of chip technology is defined by the minimum size of fundamental components that switch current at nanosecond intervals. Today the industry is making the commercial transition from what the industry generally describes as 14-nanometer manufacturing to 10-nanometer manufacturing. Each generation brings roughly a 50 percent reduction in the area required by a given amount of circuitry. IBM’s new chips, though still in a research phase, suggest that semiconductor technology will continue to shrink at least through 2018. The semiconductor industry must now decide if IBM’s bet on silicon-germanium is the best way forward. It must also grapple with the shift to using extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, light to etch patterns on chips at a resolution that approaches the diameter of individual atoms. In the past, Intel said it could see its way toward seven-nanometer manufacturing. But it has not said when that generation of chip making might arrive. IBM also declined to speculate on when it might begin commercial manufacturing of this technology generation. This year, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company said that it planned to begin pilot product of seven-nanometer chips in 2017. Unlike IBM, however, it has not demonstrated working chips to meet that goal.\\n\\nHow to use Facebook’s new News Feed controls:\\xa0Facebook made a pretty big announcement Thursday, saying it will now allow users much greater control over what appears in their News Feeds. Prioritize whom to see first: There are a few things you can customize in the new menu, starting with telling Facebook which friends of yours should always be at the top of your news feed. Facebook calls this the \"See First\" crowd. Unfollow people to hide their posts: The next step gives you a chance to unfollow people whose posts may have been making you avoid the news feed. Reconnect with people you unfollowed: Facebook also gives you the chance to \"Reconnect with people you unfollowed\" if you\\'re in a forgiving mood. Discover new Pages: This section is more or less a way for Facebook users to find the more professional pages on the site — those run by brands, celebrities or other public figures.\\n\\nSlew of Developer-Focused Announcements from Amazon, Including “Amazon Fling,” A Developer Toolkit For Sending Media From Mobile Apps To Fire TV:\\xa0Amid a slew of developer-focused announcements from Amazon today focused on things like using AWS for app testing, and the arrival of a new API Gateway service, for example, the company also introduced the new “Amazon Fling” service. Available as an SDK for iOS and Android applications, Amazon Fling allows developers to build apps that can send media content to Amazon’s Fire TV as well as work as “second screen” or companion apps to what’s already running on Fire TV. “Flinging,” which is basically Amazon’s own version of Chromecast’s “casting,” lets a mobile app maker send a video, audio or images from their iOS or Android app to a user’s big screen TV by way of the Amazon Fire TV media player. It does this by simplifying the underlying network discovery and communication technologies that would otherwise be difficult to implement, the company explains. With Amazon Fling, Amazon made a point to appeal to developers who are already leveraging Chromecast functionality in their apps by making it possible to integrate the new Amazon SDK with an existing Android or iOS Chromecast app. To simplify the process, the company released developer documentation that explains how to modify an existing app that’s using the Google Cast Companion Library to also support Amazon Fling. Developers who have already built an Amazon Fire TV app can use the SDK to both control their app, if it’s already installed, or remotely install it if not. For developers without an Amazon Fire TV app, they’re able to use the Amazon Fire TV media player instead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an MP3 version of this snippet\\n\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft hangs up on Nokia business, to cut 7,800 jobs in a retreat from its failing smartphone business:\\xa0Microsoft said on Wednesday it would cut 7,800 jobs, or nearly 7 percent of its workforce, and write down about $7.6 billion related to its Nokia phone business. Most of the job cuts will be in the phone hardware business, underscoring the company\\'s shift in focus to software and cloud from hardware. About a third of the layoffs will be in Finland, where Microsoft will shut down a product development unit, according to Finland\\'s national broadcaster YLE. This is the second round of job cuts since Satya Nadella took over as chief executive in February 2014. Microsoft said last July it would slash up to 18,000 jobs. RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan said he estimates the latest layoffs to reduce operating expenses by more than $1 billion on an annualized basis. Microsoft, which wrote down more than $7 billion of goodwill related to its purchase of the majority of Nokia’s hardware business. The charge was not a surprise. The scale of the dismissal was; the total sum deleted is larger than the originally reported purchase price of the assets in question. So, to be clear, Microsoft’s earnings on a normal accounting (GAAP) basis are hosed in the current quarter. The write-down underscores the fact that nobody other than Apple makes money in hardware. Even so, Microsoft\\'s shares rose as much as 1.4 percent and have risen about 22 percent since Nadella took over in February last year.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Apple plans record initial production of new iPhones\\xa0:\\xa0Apple is preparing for the largest initial production run for its next iPhones by the end of the year, the Wall Street journal reported. The company is asking suppliers to manufacture 85 million to 90 million units of two new models with 4.7-inch and 5-inch displays. The company had ordered 70 million to 80 million of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus last year, in its largest initial production run so far. The new phones are also expected to feature Force Touch technology which can distinguish between a light tap and deep press, people familiar with the matter told the Journal. The screen sizes are the same as in the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Apple is also expected to maintain the screen resolution.\\n\\nDidi Kuaidi, the Chinese Ride-Hailing Service, Raises $2 Billion:\\xa0As companies listed in China continue to suffer fallout from the stock market collapse, the Chinese ride-sharing app Didi Kuaidi on Wednesday showed why it is good to be private. The company, whose smartphone services connect users to taxis and private drivers, said in a statement that it had raised $2 billion in a new round of fund-raising, and might raise still more. Didi Kuaidi set out to raise $1.5 billion on June 22, according to its president, Jean Liu. Within five days, the goal had been met, and now the company has closed on at least $2 billion. ‘‘All of our investors are super-long-term investors, and they won’t get affected by short-term hiccup’’ in the stock market, Ms. Liu said. ‘‘They see another Alibaba coming.’’ Didi Kuaidi was born in competition as the amalgam of two companies, Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache, that spent heavily and competed ruthlessly for market share in 2013 and 2014 before joining forces. After the fund-raising round, Didi Kuaidi has cash reserves of $3.5 billion, which it said it would spend on building new services, financing research in data analytics and improving customer experiences.\\n\\nMeerkat Makes Friends With Facebook’s API, moves on from Twitter:\\xa0Live streaming app Meerkat rolled out several major updates this morning, including the ability to sign up on the platform through Facebook instead of Twitter, a feature that lets you invite those watching your stream to take over that stream, and it now facilitates saving streams in something called the Meerkat Library instead of on your phone. Meerkat was on a roll shortly after launching earlier this year, thanks largely due to Twitter’s social graph. Meerkat would tweet out that users were live on the platform every time they started a stream. More people started streaming, more tweets went out. But then came Periscope, Twitter’s rival platform. Twitter then blocked Meerkat from its social graph and that was the end of that romance. It looks like Meerkat has moved on from its breakup and is now in the friendly arms of Facebook. Even with the bad blood betwixt them, folks still had to have a Twitter account to sign up on the app. Now they just need Facebook.\\n\\nCapital One’s String of Mobile Acquisitions Turns Into a Monsoon:\\xa0It was somewhat surprising last year when Web design firm Adaptive Path was acquired by banking company Capital One. But the bank hasn’t stopped there. On Wednesday it is announcing it has also scooped up Monsoon, a 40-person mobile development shop based in Oakland, California. Capital One won’t say how much it is paying for Monsoon, but said it is in line with other acquisitions of similarly sized firms. As for why it is buying Monsoon, Managing Vice President Skip Potter said the company has a lot of ideas on how to revolutionize banking with mobile apps but needs more workers than it could simply hire on its own. Capital One, best known for its credit card business, has been trying to attract a new generation of banking customers who prefer powerful apps over physical branches. It has opened a handful of cafes in big cities such as San Francisco, but even there the focus is on helping customers get familiar with the brand as opposed to handling individual transactions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an MP3 version of this snippet\\n\\n\\nChina stocks are 8% down this morning; Alibaba stock is at its lifetime low:\\xa0China\\'s securities regulator said there was \"panic sentiment\" in mainland stock markets on Wednesday, acknowledging the recent increase in irrational selling, Reuters reported. Shortly after, the People\\'s Bank of China said it will closely watch stock market direction and guard against systematic regional financial risks. The comments did little to soothe investor worries about tumbling mainland equities, with the Shanghai Composite sinking more than 8 percent in early trade on Wednesday. In US trading, Alibaba was traded at its lifetime low.\\n\\nWorldwide spend on gadgets will fall year-on-year this year for the first time since 2010:\\xa0According to a new forecast from Gartner, shoppers worldwide will spend less on gadgets in 2015 than they did in 2014 — the first drop since 2010. Analysts from Gartner still predict we\\'ll spend a total of $606 billion in 2015. But it\\'s still a decline of 5.7 percent compared with 2014 — lower than Gartner had forecast just three months ago. So what\\'s behind the softer sales? Its because sales of desktops, tablets and smartphones are all slowing. Fewer people are buying desktop computers in Western Europe, Japan and Russia. In addition the tablet market is reaching its saturation point, and that analysts expect users to upgrade their tablets an average of once every three years — far less than smartphones. Sales of mobile devices such as smartphones as well as of high-end laptops will continue to grow, the firm said. Still, even within that bright spot, there is some hint of a slowdown. The rates of first-time smartphone buyers in China, one of the world\\'s fastest-growing and most important mobile markets, have slowed.\\n\\nAlibaba boosts Singapore Post stake, invest in SingPost\\'s e-commerce unit:\\xa0Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is investing about $206 million to expand its holdings in Singapore Post and its e-commerce subsidiary, the two companies said in a statement. SingPost is seeking to boost its e-commerce business to offset weak postal revenues, and last year an Alibaba unit bought an over 10 percent stake in SingPost for $249 million. In the latest deal, Alibaba said it was buying an additional 5 percent stake in SingPost for S$187.1 million. Alibaba will also invest up to S$92 million to buy a 34 percent stake in Quantium Solutions, a SingPost subsidiary that provides e-commerce logistics across the Asia Pacific. Alibaba is currently the second largest shareholder in SingPost after Singapore Telecommunications\\n\\nMusic streaming firm Saavn raises $100M from Tiger Global, others:\\xa0Saavn (South Asian Audio Video Network), a US-based Indian music streaming firm, has raised $100 million in Series C funding from existing investor Tiger Global Management and others. The company will use the money to improve product development efforts and to speed up customer acquisition. Saavn is said to be preparing for the launch of a video streaming service. The company claims to be adding one million users every month. Earlier this year, Saavn had appointed former Google executive Mahesh Narayanan as COO. Last year, Saavn added Twitter-powered radio station to its service. It also entered into licensing agreements with Warner Music and EMI Music that helped it add 800,000 tracks from international artists.\\n\\nClipMine Improves Videos With Crowdsourced Tagging And Annotations:\\xa0So this happens to me pretty often: I pull up an online video that I want to watch, only to be taken aback when I realize that it’s 10 or 20 or 30 minutes long. It’s particularly frustrating when there’s just one section or just one quote that I’m looking for. I end up skipping around trying to find that one bit — not exactly a great experience. A new startup is trying to fix that. With ClipMine, you get searchable videos, with a table of contents. For example, here’s a curated collection of videos related to startups. With each video, not only can you see an outline of all the big topics covered and jump to the section that interests you, you can also search for every time something gets mentioned (though your success will depend on how thoroughly the video has been tagged and annotated). To be clear, ClipMine isn’t trying to build its own video player. Instead, it sits on top of players like YouTube. You can also install a plugin to see the ClipMine player anywhere you see YouTube videos.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an MP3 version of this snippet\\n\\n\\nAs Google and Uber Circle Each Other, Google to Test Carpooling Service in Israel:\\xa0Google said on Monday that it would start testing a carpooling service in Tel Aviv through Waze, the Israeli social mapping start-up that the company bought in 2013 for $1 billion. Unlike similar services offered by the likes of Uber, Google’s carpooling service will allow drivers to recoup only the cost of gas and wear and tear to their vehicles. Drivers will not be able to use the app to offer traditional taxi services. The service, which is currently available only in Israel, is part of Google’s increasing moves into the territory of Uber, the ride-booking service in which the search giant has invested millions of dollars through Google Ventures, its venture capital unit. Over the last year, tensions between the two companies have mounted as both jockey to offer people new services like self-driving cars and on-demand delivery of goods like groceries. Uber, which is valued at roughly $50 billion, has announced plans to develop autonomous cars, and has a team of engineers working on digital mapping technology. The company also has made a tentative offer for Nokia’s digital mapping unit. Uber has started its own carpooling service in the United States, which allows users to divide the cost of a ride when traveling in the same direction.\\n\\nSamsung Profit Misses Estimates on Galaxy S6 Phone Struggles:\\xa0Samsung Electronics posted second-quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates as shortages of new smartphones made it harder to lure customers from Apple’s iPhone and cheaper devices made in China. Operating income fell 4 percent to 6.9 trillion won ($6.1 billion) in the three months ended June, the company said in a filing Tuesday. That compares with the 7.2 trillion won average of 33 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Samsung’s seventh straight profit drop comes as Galaxy S6 phone sales have fallen short after winning early praise as a device that could attract users that had shifted to Apple’s iPhone 6. Production constraints for the model with a curved display have led to shortages, trimming sales of the device and forcing the company to rely more on its chip unit for earnings. The company\\'s shares were little changed in trading in Seoul.\\n\\nMood-changing wearable tech sets pulses racing:\\xa0Doppel is a new breed of wearable device, one that its developers say can actually change the wearer\\'s mood by delivering a tactile beat to their wrist. The makers of \\'doppel\\' call it the next generation of wearable technology - one that can actually change the mood of the user. They say the device taps in to the body\\'s natural rhythm and gives the wearer control over how alert or relaxed they are. Similar to the way that upbeat music can motivate the body, while downbeat music relaxes; doppel provides a tactile beat to the wearer\\'s wrist that they can adjust to make themselves feel more alert or relaxed. Doppel is synchronized to each individual via a smartphone app that measures their resting heart rate. This is all the information needed for the device to tap into the body\\'s natural response to external rhythms. Team Turquoise says prototype models have been successfully tested on hundreds of people. They say doppel was also independently tested by psychologists at Royal Holloway University of London; with their controlled tests showing the device can improve alertness when correctly set to the user\\'s preference. The team is planning further independent tests aimed at validating doppel\\'s ability to calm people down and reduce anxiety. They recently launched a Kickstarter campaign to turn their prototypes in to consumer-ready models, with backers to be the first to get their hands on their own doppel.\\n\\nSearch After the Search Box: Google Now Pushes Into the Next Frontier of Mobile Behavior:\\xa0Google Now, an intelligence layer on Android and the Google app that was launched in 2011 is beginning to spring to life. In January, the service started integrating with popular apps, pushing notifications customized around personal data. This summer the product team is rolling out Now on Tap, a new Android feature that weaves Now into apps (and, likely soon, mobile websites). It’s search without the search bar — and, sometimes, without the query. Aparna Chennapragada, the Google executive who has run Google Now, its AI-driven smart personal assistant, since the start of this year, spelled out the three-pronged direction of the product — what she called the “bets” her team is taking. The first bet was embedding Now with Google’s full “Knowledge Graph” — the billions-thick Web of people, places and things and their many interconnections. The second is context. Now groks both the user’s location and the myriad of signals from others in the same spot. If you enter a mall, Now will tailor cards to what people in that mall typically ask for. And this is where the third benchmark for Now comes in: Tying that context to the apps on your phone, or ones you have yet to download. In two years, Google has indexed some 50 billion links within apps. In April, it began listing install links to apps deemed relevant in search. Indexed apps will be included in Now on Tap when it arrives in the latest Android version this fall.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an MP3 version of this snippet\\n\\n\\n\\nEuro markets set for major jolt after Greek \\'No\\', look to ECB for calm:\\xa0European stock and bond markets are set to take a sharp hit on Monday after Greece voted \\'No\\' to harsh bailout conditions, and bankers said the European Central Bank\\'s response was now key to the extent of contagion. \"The ECB has the capacity to limit the spread of contagion. But we might still see a fall of 3 percent on European markets on Monday,\" said Antonin Jullier, head of equity trading strategy at Citi. With no immediate prospect of a bailout for the Greek government, its banks need further help to avoid collapsing. Oil prices tumbled as the US dollar strengthened. European officials are putting the onus on the Greek government to make the next move as Chancellor Angela Merkel heads to Paris on Monday for talks with President Francois Hollande to map out a way forward for Greece.\\n\\nAfter weeks of turmoil, China stocks rocket 8 percent at open after weekend rescue moves:\\xa0China\\'s stock markets rose 8% at the start of a make-or-break week after officials rolled out an unprecedented series of steps at the weekend to prevent a full-blown stock market crash that would threaten the world\\'s second-largest economy. The government is anxiously awaiting the market opening on Monday to see if the new measures will halt a 30 percent plunge in the last three weeks, or if panicky investors who borrowed heavily to speculate on stocks will continue to sell. In an extraordinary weekend of policy moves, brokerages and fund managers vowed to buy massive amounts of stocks, helped by China\\'s state-backed margin finance company which in turn would be aided by a direct line of liquidity from the central bank. China has also orchestrated a halt to new share issues, with dozens of firms scrapping their IPO plans in separate but similarly worded statements over the weekend, in a tactic authorities have used before to support markets. The Shanghai Composite Index had surged more than 150 percent in the 12 months prior to June 12 as investors assessed that monetary stimulus would revive China’s economy. Now, those hopes seem to be fading, and Chinese equity markets are plunging. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 5.8 percent Friday, bringing the decline since its June 12 peak to 29 percent. More than $2.8 trillion of value has been erased from the Chinese stock market during that time, an abrupt end to the longest bull market in the nation’s history. Stocks entered a bear market on June 29 as leveraged investors headed for the exits; China’s securities regulator that day urged investors to be rational. In response, China is suspending initial public offerings, creating a market stabilization fund and telling investors not to panic in an effort to shore up its stock market, which has had the largest three-week drop since 1992. According to company filings to the exchanges Saturday evening, 10 companies will suspend IPOs on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and 18 will do the same at the Shenzen Stock Exchange. Halting IPOs may stem the diversion of funds away from current listings. The move came hours after major Chinese brokerage firms pledged billions of dollars to form a stock market rescue fund.\\n\\nNew, Simple ‘Buy’ Buttons Aim to Entice Mobile Shoppers:\\xa0Despite spending close to three hours of each day staring at their mobile phones, Americans continue to do the vast majority of their online shopping through desktop and laptop computers, which have larger screens and physical keyboards that are more amenable to browsing and typing in credit card numbers. Mobile phones are projected to account for about half the time Americans spend online this year, but only about one-fifth of retail e-commerce sales, according to eMarketer. Now several companies, including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, are trying to bridge the gap between mobile browsing and desktop purchasing with a simple “buy” button. Buy buttons have been around since the early days of the web, of course, notably with Amazon’s “One-Click Ordering,” where people set up a button that runs their credit card and ships whatever they have bought to a designated address. But these new buy buttons allow technology companies to act as middlemen between mobile shoppers and retailers — extending one-click ordering to thousands of small retailers and eliminating exasperating typing on a phone’s touch screen. The logic for the companies working on the new buy buttons is that, in an increasingly mobile world, where people do less typing and more tapping, a more predictable checkout process will drive sales by reducing “friction,” which is a technology industry euphemism for any inconvenience, no matter how small, that might cause people to wonder why they are opening their wallets.\\n\\nAlibaba Arm Eyes More Capital to Build China Finance Empire:\\xa0Ant Financial, which dominates e-commerce payments in China, was said to be valued at over $40 billion in its latest round -- making it one of the world’s largest private tech companies. It manages the nation’s biggest money market fund Yu’E Bao and is targeting smaller borrowers to tap a market overlooked by traditional banks. Investors may be drawn by Ant Financial’s exponential growth. Since it began life as Alipay in 2004, the company has become the country’s largest online provider of financial services, helped by its role as the preferred payment method across Alibaba platforms. It has since expanded into adjacent industries such as insurance and online credit. One of the more aggressive of China’s new breed of online finance companies, Ant Financial’s maneuvers have courted controversy in the past. Ma spun off Alipay into a new company he controlled in 2011, citing the risk of foreign ownership of domestic financial firms. Major shareholder Yahoo protested and said it was caught unaware.\\n\\nTesla Rises After Second-Quarter Deliveries Top Forecast:\\xa0Tesla Motors gained the most since April after the electric-car maker beat its car-sales forecast for the second consecutive quarter with a 52 percent surge in the three months through June. The shares rose 4 percent at the close in New York for the biggest daily advance since April 27. Tesla has climbed 26 percent this year, outpacing the Russell 1000 Index’s 1.3 percent increase. Tesla delivered 11,507 Model S sedans in the second quarter, according to a statement of preliminary figures Thursday. The Palo Alto, California-based company predicted in May that it would sell 10,000 to 11,000 of the cars, its only model, during the period. The preliminary total brings first-half sales to 21,552, less than 40 percent of Tesla’s full-year target of 55,000 vehicles. Output and deliveries are projected to increase with the introduction of the Model X sport utility vehicle this quarter. “Tesla still has to deliver on the Model X promise,” Dan Dolev, a Jefferies analyst, said in a telephone interview. With the Model S, “the execution is there, the demand is there, the delivery is there, so that all these areas are positive is encouraging.”\\n\\nHousing crisis puts SoftBank in a spot amidst its headline grabbing announcements:\\xa0The fall of Housing.com from one of the hottest tech startups in India to a big public relations disaster has been quick, thanks to its just ousted CEO Rahul Yadav. And this has put the largest owner of Housing—Japanese internet giant SoftBank, one of the biggest internet investors from Asia with $70B in revenue—in a delicate spot. Only six months ago it wrote a $90 million cheque for this college startup in exchange of a 32.5 per cent stake, but it appears SoftBank is already exploring a sale. Sources familiar with developments at the online real estate company said Quikr-Housing.com deal, as reported by VCCircle, is in works but it may not be easy to fructify due to several reasons including a mismatch in valuation expectations. SoftBank, Housing’s biggest stakeholder, is said to be seeking a price of $350 million which none of its rivals would want to cough up considering the startup’s main asset is its product and technology and not so much the business (revenues). As an immediate sale may prove to be daunting, sources say SoftBank’s current priority would be to stabilise the affairs at the startup while also increase the monetisation efforts rather than stepping up the sell-off initiatives. “They wanted to make a big bang entry into India with a $1 billion investment, make a splash, and get a meeting with (Prime Minister) Modi..,” said a venture capital investor who manages a diverse portfolio, indicating the Japanese giant might have made a mistake in a hurry to invest.\\n\\nReddit Moderators Revolt Over Site\\'s Firing of Popular Talent Director Victoria Taylor:\\xa0Hundreds of Reddit\\'s community forums—called subreddits—have been made inaccessible to the public in protest after the San Francisco-based company dismissed its director of talent, Victoria Taylor, who ran its Ask Me Anything (AMA) feature. The extremely popular AMA subreddit has been temporarily shut down by its moderators, while the reasons for Taylor\\'s exit haven\\'t been revealed. According to Business Insider, Reddit user \"Karmanaut\" posted about Taylor\\'s departure, stating: \"We have been really blindsided by all of this. As a result, we will need to go through our processes and see what can be done without her.\" The Business Insider story added that Taylor replied in a subbredit thread that she was \"dazed\" by the development but planned to stay in the public relations/communications field. For the AMA program, she has been credited for booking everyone from Hollywood stars like Madonna and Will Ferrell to political players such as President Barack Obama and conservative commentator Ann Coulter. Taylor was widely beloved by Redditors for cultivating such an intriguing mix of content. Reddit may be wise to shed more light on Taylor\\'s departure sooner rather than later, otherwise the subject could continue to explode throughout the July 4 weekend. Already, many users are threatening to leave Reddit for good in an exodus similar to the user backlash that gutted competing site Digg in 2010.\\n\\nReports that Amazon is trying Special Price Discounts on Prime, possibly to challenge Jet, the Hot Discount Shopping Site:\\xa0The last time the companies run by Jeff Bezos and Marc Lore squared off, there were fireworks. We’re about to see what happens the second time around. The first time, Amazon instigated a pricing war with Lore’s company, Diapers.com, ultimately pressuring it into a $550 million sale to Amazon. It wasn’t exactly the outcome Lore was hoping for, but was a pretty good exit nonetheless. Now, as Lore’s new, members-only shopping site Jet.com preps for its public launch, there are some signs that Bezos once again doesn’t plan to sit aside idly. In the last few months, Amazon has been offering discounts on different products as exclusive deals for members of Prime, its two-day shipping and streaming media program. Last week, reports surfaced showing that Amazon was giving special discounts on video games to Prime members. Amazon has sporadically offered special discounts to Prime members in the past, such as exclusive discounts on Vizio TVs dating back to 2013. But the timing of the current set of discounts across multiple product categories could have to do with the fact that Jet, which is operating in private beta currently, is also a membership program built on the idea of discount pricing. For $50 a year, Jet is promising its members the best prices on the Web thanks to a complex system of discounting by stripping costs out of the order fulfillment and shipping process of e-commerce.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n.\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an MP3 version of this snippet\\n\\n\\nTwitter Pushes Ads With A New Button Atop Mobile Users’ Profiles:\\xa0Twitter’s latest push to monetize its service has led to the rollout of a new “Twitter Ads” button, which is now prominently appearing on user profile pages on both the iOS and Android client applications. The newly added button, which some users may have initially mistaken as a shortcut to Twitter analytics, is found right next to the “Edit profile” button, the account switcher and the Settings icon. By clicking on the Ads button, users are offered the ability to manage their Twitter ad campaigns while on the go. That’s a different tactic–and perhaps a more overzealous one–than the one Facebook took when it introduced a way to manage Facebook ads via smartphones earlier this year. The company launched a dedicated Facebook Ads Manager App which not only allowed current advertisers to track the way their ad campaigns were performing, but actually brought the creation process itself to mobile phones. Here, users could write ad text, upload photos, and even target their desired audience right from the app itself. Not everyone is happy with the change, which some Twitter users are calling “desperate,” or “ugly.” And it’s hard to find fault with those sentiments. If you’re not currently running a Twitter ad campaign, the feature does nothing more than let you know that this button serves as a place where you can manage an ad campaign in the future – it doesn’t go so far as to allow users to actually get started building their first campaign from the app itself.\\n\\nTwitter Launches \"Personas\", Aiming To Make It Easier for Advertisers to Target Audience Niches:\\xa0Twitter wants to make targeting easier for advertisers, so today it unveiled a feature called \"personas,\" which lets brands target groups of consumers based on whether they have college degrees, are parents, make more or less than $100,000 or run small businesses, to name a few. More specifically, marketers can not only target college grads but also pinpoint such alums based on their gender, location and interests. Advertisers could piece together similar targeting parameters on Twitter in the past, but now they can build more precise campaigns with just a mouse click or two. The San Francisco-based tech company is leveraging ongoing partnerships with data companies Acxiom and Datalogix to bring such targeting options to the table. The development is reminiscent of Facebook\\'s people-based marketing product moves of 2014, when it rolled out \"Audience Insights\" and other similar products. Personas and the campaign insights are now available to advertisers, globally.\\n\\nYelp Sale Process to Stall as Founder Decides to Wait; Stock Slumps:\\xa0Yelp, which hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to find a buyer, has temporarily decided not to pursue a sale. The consumer-review website has had several interested suitors but isn’t pursuing a transaction in the immediate future. The firm may pursue a deal again if co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Stoppelman changes his mind, one of the people said. Yelp dropped 12 percent in afternoon trading in New York, giving the company a market value of about $2.8 billion. Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported in May that Yelp was working with a bank to explore a sale. Yelp hired Goldman Sachs after receiving takeover interest.\\n\\nXiaomi reports sequential sales fall, putting full-year goal in doubt:\\xa0China\\'s top smartphone maker Xiaomi on Thursday reported semi-annual sales that for the first time were lower than the previous six months, jeopardising its full-year target and hinting at a slowdown in its mainstay domestic market. The firm said it sold 34.7 million handsets in January-June versus 35.0 million in July-December - the first sequential fall since the company began disclosing six-month figures in 2013. For 2015, it aims for minimum sales of 80 million smartphones. Smartphone shipments in China - where Xiaomi is No. 1 - fell in the first quarter for the first time in six years, though it was unclear whether the drop signalled the start of a downward trend, researcher IDC said in May. Beijing-based Xiaomi has been expanding overseas to relieve the pressure at home, focusing on India, Southeast Asia and, from next week, Brazil.\\n\\nVenture Investment In Healthcare Declines Through Q2 After Record 2014:\\xa0After a record-breaking year of growth in 2014, venture capital investors in healthcare seem to have settled into a groove. They invested roughly $2.8 billion in healthcare technologies through the second quarter of 2015, down from $3.3 billion over the same period last year, according to a study from Startup Health. Nearly $6.8 billion went into healthcare technologies that year, up from $3 billion the year before. Driven by twin engines of government legislation and technology innovation around wearable devices and data, venture capital investments in healthcare went up like a rocket in 2014. Now, the industry seems to be catching its breath a bit. Investments in healthcare technology actually held steady in the second quarter at $1.8 billion after a $500 million decline year-on-year in the first quarter. An examination of some of the companies that have raised the most money and successfully exited: Zenefits and Oscar Health , which are tackling the regulatory changes brought on by the Affordable Care Act, raised more than respectable $500 million and $145 million rounds, respectively. While Nant Health, a company using big data analytics for genomic sequencing, and HealthCatalyst, which uses data to track health across populations, both scored big with their own big rounds of $200 million and $70 million. On the wearables side, the FitBit public offering proved that even public markets were interested in the wearable health opportunity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",
      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\nHere is an MP3 version of this snippet\\n\\n\\nAs More Tech Start-Ups Stay Private, So Does the Money:\\xa0Something strange has happened in the last couple of years: The initial public offering of stock has become déclassé. For start-up entrepreneurs and their employees across Silicon Valley, an initial public offering is no longer a main goal. Instead, many founders talk about going public as a necessary evil to be postponed as long as possible because it comes with more problems than benefits. Silicon Valley’s sudden distaste for the IPO. — rooted in part in Wall Street’s skepticism of new tech stocks — may be the single most important psychological shift underlying the current tech boom. Staying private affords start-up executives the luxury of not worrying what outsiders think and helps them avoid the quarterly earnings treadmill. It also means Wall Street is doing what it failed to do in the last tech boom: using traditional metrics like growth and profitability to price companies. Investors have been tough on Twitter, for example, because its user growth has slowed. They have been tough on Box, the cloud-storage company that went public last year, because it remains unprofitable. And the e-commerce company Zulily, which went public last year, was likewise punished when it cut its guidance for future sales. During a recent presentation for Andreessen Horowitz’s limited partners — the institutions that give money to the venture firm — Marc Andreessen, the firm’s co-founder, told the journalist Dan Primack that he had never seen a sharper divergence in how investors treat public- and private-company chief executives. “They tell the public C.E.O., ‘Give us the money back this quarter,’ and they tell the private C.E.O., ‘No problem, go for 10 years,’ ” Mr. Andreessen said.\\n\\n\\nPayPal to Acquire Xoom for $890 Million Ahead of EBay Split:\\xa0PayPal agreed to purchase Xoom Corp, a service for sending international money transfers, in a deal valued at $890 million. PayPal will acquire Xoom for $25 per share in cash, a 21 percent premium to Wednesday’s closing price. The purchase is expected to slightly reduce PayPal’s earnings per share for fiscal 2016, the company said. The acquisition puts PayPal in the international money transfer market with Western Union, the dominant player in what PayPal President Dan Schulman estimated is a $600 billion market. “It’s an industry that’s ripe for disruption,” Schulman, who will become chief executive officer of the stand-alone PayPal, said in an interview. Xoom, based in San Francisco, enables U.S. customers to send as much as $3,000 in a single transaction to friends and family around the world using their mobile phones, tablets or computers. Its 1.3 million users transferred $7 billion to 37 countries, including Mexico, China and India, in the 12 months ended March 31, the company said. Xoom’s first-quarter revenue gained 24 percent to $44.4 million.\\n\\n\\nIndia Now Uber’s Second Largest Market - By City Coverage - Following Expansion To 7 New Cities:\\xa0Uber is continuing its focus on Asia after announcing that it will expand into seven new cities in India, taking it to a total of 18 locations in the country. With 18 cities served, India becomes the company’s biggest market based on city coverage, behind only the U.S..The U.S. firm recently claimed one million rides per day in China following rapid growth, and it is also sweet on India. It has hired a president to run its business in India and has seemingly invested significant sums to grow its visibility and presence in India, now it’s time to crank its plans up a gear. Uber said that this expansion — which will see it drive into Bhubaneswar, Coimbatore, Indore, Mysore, Nagpur, Surat and Visakhapatnam — is the “largest number of new international cities [it] has ever launched together.” A leaked letter to investors recently suggested that China will overtake the U.S. as Uber’s largest market based on rides handle per day. While the company isn’t spilling raw figures for its business in India, it did say that it is seeing “unprecedented” 40 percent month-on-month growth across the country.\\n\\n\\nFacebook Will Start Sharing Ad Revenue With Video Creators:\\xa0Facebook is offering video creators like the NBA, Fox Sports and Funny or Die a revenue split from ads sold alongside their videos beginning this fall. It’s the first time Facebook has done any kind of revenue share around video, and the pitch to content creators is pretty transparent: Share your content with us and we’ll share some of the money we make back with you. The move is a full-on attack against YouTube, which has dominated the digital video market for the better half of a decade. Facebook has been able to attract content creators because of its massive reach, but now it’s offering them the one thing YouTube has offered for years: Money. YouTube also uses a revenue split to entice content creators — the same revenue split, actually — with 55 percent going to the video creator and the remaining 45 percent staying with the platform. But Facebook’s argument is that it can get more eyeballs for your video. People don’t have to hunt to find your video — Facebook will show it to them. And those people don’t need to be following your Facebook Page, either. The revenue share on Facebook doesn’t apply to all videos in News Feed. Instead, the company is rolling out a new feature called Suggested Videos, a News Feed of sorts that’s exclusively video content. For example, if you click on a video in your News Feed about snowboarding, you’ll be taken to the Suggested Videos feed where you can watch that video, then scroll down to see others that are similar. There will be ads in this stream — standalone, autoplay ads like you might find in News Feed — and this is where the revenue share comes into play.\\n\\n\\nGoogle Tests Price Comparison Within Product Listing Ads To Compete with Amazon, Jet:\\xa0Google is testing a new Product Listing Ad format that informs shoppers of their percentage savings within a PLA. In the examples that our digital marketing experts uncovered, Google states about the product, “Price is X% lower than average online prices.” At first glance, it looks like this could be an extension of the “Value Alert” feature covered earlier this year in Search Engine Land. Where Google pulls the data to find the average online price has not yet been disclosed. However, based on some quick calculations for a “KitchenAid Mixer” (showing as 14% off in the image below), for the 47 listed on Google Shopping the price was 13.9% off inclusive of shipping but exclusive of tax. This makes sense because tax would vary based upon your location. This suggests that Google is using all of the models that are listed on Google Shopping, as opposed to just the subset featured in the Product Listing Ad. Channel Advisor, which first reported this, theorizes the experiment could have come about because larger marketplaces like Amazon, and potentially newcomer Jet.com, have the potential to continue to eat away at Google’s business. That is, instead of turning to Google’s search engine to locate products, consumers just go directly to Amazon’s website to find low-priced items.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an MP3 version of this snippet\\n\\n\\nFacebook is testing a more conservative definition of video views, but is still far more aggressive than YouTube in charging advertisers:\\xa0While Facebook charges advertisers for videos the second they appear in a news feed, views are defined differently since users can easily scroll past the ads. Facebook considers a view to last three seconds compared with YouTube\\'s 30-second rule. This has resulted in marketers\\' clips uploaded to Facebook to amass a wealth of views compared with those published on YouTube in recent months. But those views don\\'t necessarily mean people are watching ads. Now, advertisers can start paying for videos with a cost-per-view rate that kicks in after a user watches for 10 seconds, making the ad seemingly more valuable to advertisers who want to pay for qualified views. Until now, advertisers have paid for videos immediately after they show up in a news feed—something akin to a cost-per-impression model. When Twitter launched autoplay video earlier this month, it tried to address concerns by promising brands 100 percent viewability: promising only to charge on video ads that have been seen 100 percent in full view of the user..\\n\\nXiaomi Continues International Push, Starts Selling $160 Redmi 2 Phone in Brazil:\\xa0Xiaomi made its expected move into the Brazil market on Tuesday, announcing plans to sell its affordable Redmi 2 smartphone for 499 Brazilian reals ($161). To avoid hefty taxes placed on foreign imports, Xiaomi is working with Foxconn to have the devices built in Brazil, with additional products coming soon.\\n\\nOnline recharge and mobile wallet app MobiKwik targets $700M GTV in 2015-16, profits by 2016-17:\\xa0MobiKwik.com, is gunning for a nearly four-fold jump in gross transaction value to $700 million (Rs 4,270 crore) this year. “We don’t have the audited numbers right now, but I can tell you that we have crossed the 2014-15 target of Rs 1200 crore ($190 million) sales and are looking forward to $700 million sales this year,” Upasana Taku, co-founder of the company told Techcircle. The Gurgaon-based company aims to turn profitable by financial year 2016-17. “We expect to meet our goal of 100 million users for the mobile wallet by 2016-17 and so next year we anticipate to start generating profits,” she added. Profitability is the holy grail for India’s fast growing consumer internet firms. MobiKwik’s competitor, the Alibaba-backed Paytm saw the gross value of the transactions conducted on its network rise to around Rs 4,000 crore by 2014-end from around Rs 1,000 crore the year before. Paytm is said to be targeting gross merchandise value (GMV) run rate of $3-4 billion by March 2015. MobiKwik plans to spend about Rs 100 crore on marketing this financial year. Most of the money will be deployed on television and online campaigns. MobiKwik is also betting big on joining hands with offline service provider. It started a service for offline players in March 2015 and has the likes of quick service restaurants, grocery stores and coffee stores on its platform. It has tie ups with Big Bazaar, Cafe Coffee Day and other players for the same.\\n\\nApple Music First Look: Rich, Robust — But Confusing:\\xa0Paid streaming music has arrived on Planet Apple, where it was regarded as unworthy for years. Today, the tech giant has entered the streaming music business with its much-anticipated Apple Music subscription service. Like other streaming services, it offers access to tens of millions of tracks for a monthly fee. Would I pay $10 a month — $120 a year — to use it? My answer is a tentative yes, with some caveats. Apple has built a handsome, robust app and service that goes well beyond just offering a huge catalog of music by providing many ways to discover and group music for a very wide range of tastes and moods. But it’s also uncharacteristically complicated by Apple standards, with everything from a global terrestrial radio station to numerous suggested playlists for different purposes in different places. One of the most confusing aspects of Apple Music is that it moves all your iTunes Music to the cloud, along with the streaming catalog. On the other hand, the service has three big strengths, in my view. First, it smoothly integrates the existing library of iTunes songs you own with the much larger catalog of music you are merely, in effect, renting. Second, while the service does use some algorithms, it suggests numerous playlists, albums and songs curated by 300 human editors, based on your tastes. Third, while Apple’s $10 monthly fee per user is both standard — and for some, pricey — the company is offering a family plan that cuts the price dramatically.\\n\\nLTE-U versus WiFi: The future of mobile data pits cellphone carriers against cable giants:\\xa0To cellular providers, WiFi represents a huge missed opportunity. Internet consumption on cellular data networks — your 3G or 4G connection - could\\'ve grown by a whopping 84 percent last year, according to Cisco. But because consumers shunted so much traffic to WiFi, that figure was much lower, at 69 percent. Carriers could charge you for all that extra access to the mobile data network. Instead they\\'re losing out when you hop onto WiFi at your home or office. And LTE-U is the industry\\'s solution. The cable industry, on the other hand, wants to keep you on WiFi as much as possible. This is the math they fear: By 2019, Americans are expected to consume nearly 10 times more mobile data than they did in 2014. By then, 77 percent of all Internet traffic will be sent and received over mobile devices rather than stationary PCs. That\\'s not good for cable, an industry that built its reputation on running fast (but fixed) Internet service into people\\'s homes and businesses. You\\'re probably familiar with 4G LTE, the current cutting edge of mobile data technology. Under ideal conditions, it provides download speeds that rival what you can get on a wired connection — fast enough to download a song in less than a minute. LTE-U is virtually identical to LTE, but with one key difference: It runs on the same frequencies that WiFi does. Unlike regular LTE, which piggybacks on airwaves owned exclusively by your carrier, LTE-U travels on public airwaves that are free to anyone. Garage door openers, cordless phones, WiFi routers — all also transmit over these open channels. Interference between the two technologies can slash WiFi transmission rates by 75 percent, according to a Google white paper filed last month to the federal government. The cable industry\\'s top trade group, the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, argued the technology could be \"disastrous\" without further protections and \"will severely degrade consumers\\' Wi-Fi experience, rendering unusable many services that are widespread today, to say nothing of the innovative new uses currently on the horizon.\"\\n\\nGoogle\\'s Local Search, unlike Google\\'s Organic Search, Favors Google+ Results, Yelp Claims:\\xa0According to a highly critical new paper out from legal scholar Tim Wu, Harvard Business School professor Michael Luca and data scientists at Yelp, many of us are totally missing out on the information that’s most relevant, and critical, to our lives. In a statement to The Washington Post, Yelp vice president of public policy Luther Lowe uses this example: If a parent searches “pediatrician NYC,” he or she will, in a prominent first-page listing, see the names of seven pediatricians who happen to have Google+ or Google+ Local pages. “The Google organic ranking algorithm does a great job at identifying helpful content on the Web,” Lowe said. “But it’s sadly not being deployed in the most common user behavior on Google: local search.” According to Yelp, from one-third to one-half of all Google searches are local. They primarily involve something called the “Local OneBox” — the special, extra-prominent list of seven links that Google displays at the top of local search results. Local OneBox takes up a big chunk of first-page real estate, frequently at the very top of the page, which means people are disproportionately more likely to click into it than they are into regular links. Local OneBox also pulls exclusively from Google’s versions of specialized search sites, such as Google+ Local.\\n\\nSamsung, HTC suffer blowback from phone financing schemes of years past, as consumers turn slow to upgrade:\\xa0It’s payback time for handset makers that long profited from Americans’ tendency to upgrade their mobile phones early and often. U.S. consumers got a taste for phone financing two years ago and never looked back. They bought fancy new devices for a few more dollars a month with no service contract attached. Now they’re holding on to their old smartphones longer than they did when they signed two-year contracts and got freebies, spelling further trouble for manufacturers like Samsung Electronics Co. and HTC Corp. that have struggled with declining sales. “When people spend $600 to $700, they are not in the mood to upgrade every year,” said independent wireless analyst Chetan Sharma. Thrifty consumers are starting to buy devices every 20 to 24 months instead of every 15 months when carriers subsidized all of their devices and made up the cost through higher service charges, he said. While iPhone maker Apple Inc. -- whose customers tend to be less price sensitive -- has remained largely unaffected, Samsung and HTC may see the most impact, analysts said. In a sign that the end of subsidies is on the horizon, Dallas-based AT and T asked in May that retail partners like Apple and Best Buy stop offering subsidized phones with two-year contracts and to sell them on its Next financing program instead. Verizon, which has been slower to move to phone financing, expects 50 percent of new sales to be on its Edge installment payment plan this year.\\n\\nCisco to buy OpenDNS for $635 million to boost security business:\\xa0Cisco said it would buy OpenDNS, a privately held cloud-based security firm, for $635 million, the latest move to boost its security business as cyber attacks increase in number and sophistication. Cisco has been buying a number of security companies, which has made its relatively tiny security business one of its fastest growing areas in the past two years. OpenDNS uses predictive intelligence to block malware, botnets and phishing threats that antivirus and firewalls miss. Cisco was a minority investor and was one of the backers that invested $35 million in OpenDNS in May last year. When Cisco buys stakes in startups, it often receives defensive rights that give it an edge to acquire companies it has invested in ahead of competitors. Cisco, whose security business is known for its firewalls, expanded into intrusion detection and prevention systems with the $2.7 billion acquisition of Sourcefire in 2013. Cisco, which has acquired dozens of companies over the years, is transitioning towards high-end switches and routers and investing in new products such as data analytics software and cloud-based tools for data centers. It bought malware analysis company ThreatGRID in 2014 and security advisory firm Neohapsis this year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an MP3 version of this snippet.\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon looks to offer loans to sellers in eight countries including India:\\xa0Amazon.com will start a business loan program for small sellers in the United Kingdom on Tuesday and is looking to launch it this year in seven more countries including India. Until now, the e-retailer has offered the service only in the United States and Japan. Amazon Lending, founded in 2012, plans to offer short-term working capital loans in other countries where it operates a third-party, seller-run marketplace business. The countries are Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Spain and China, where credit is becoming a key factor in competing for new vendors and grabbing market share. The service is on an invite-only basis and is not open to all sellers on Amazon\\'s platform. Amazon said it can safely offer loans based on internal data and because it takes loan payments out of the sales proceeds it pays sellers. Amazon offers three- to six-month loans of $1,000 to $600,000 to help merchants buy inventory. It makes money on interest and takes a cut of all sales on its marketplace, which now account for about 40 percent of total Amazon site sales. Amazon said it has offered hundreds of millions of dollars in loans since 2012, with more than half of its sellers opting for a repeat loan. Sellers interviewed by Reuters and writing on Amazon forums cited interest rates on Amazon loans ranging from 6 percent to 14 percent, in line with loans from banks and business credit cards. Stephan Aarstol, chief executive of Tower Paddle Boards, an Amazon seller, said he has taken four loans from the company starting in March 2014 because of the speed and simplicity of the process. It took him five days to get his first loan.\\n\\nMicrosoft Said to Exit Display Ad Business, Cut 1,200 Jobs:\\xa0Microsoft is shutting down its Web display advertising business and handing operations over to AOL and AppNexus, a person with knowledge of the matter said. About 1,200 jobs at Microsoft will be impacted, with some positions to be moved to AOL and AppNexus. Some people will be offered other positions at Microsoft, while other jobs will be cut, the person said.\\n\\nUber Bonds Term Sheet Reveals $470 Million in Operating Losses on $415 Million in Revenue:\\xa0Uber is telling prospective investors that it generates $470 million in operating losses on $415 million in revenue, according to a document provided to prospective investors. The term sheet viewed by Bloomberg News, which is being used to sell $1 billion to $1.2 billion in convertible bonds, doesn’t make clear the time period for those results. The document also touts 300 percent year-over-year growth. Investors in this round will be able to convert the notes at a compounded 11.5 percent discount if the company sells shares on the public market, the document shows. The bonds mature in 2022, with an 8 percent annual return if held through maturity. Uber aims to complete the deal by Tuesday, according to the document. The car-booking startup has been on a spree to raise cash. Uber is negotiating a $2 billion credit line from a group of Wall Street banks, a person with knowledge of the situation said last week. Earlier this year, it raised $1.6 billion in convertible debt from Goldman Sachs wealth-management clients, which valued the company at $40 billion. “These are substantially old numbers that do not reflect business activities today,” Uber spokeswoman Nairi Hourdajian said in an e-mail. Hourdajian declined to say why the numbers are being used to promote a current funding round.\\n\\nUber to Acquire Mapping Technology and Know-How From Microsoft:\\xa0Uber will acquire a portion of Microsoft’s maps technology and extend employment offers to around 100 engineers on Microsoft’s mapping team. Uber would not discuss the terms of the acquisition, which will bring it a data site outside Boulder, Colo., as well as cameras, image-analysis software and a license to the intellectual property. Although most Uber services rely on digital maps, much of its interest in mapping is focused on how to improve its carpooling service, UberPool. While Uber relies heavily on mapping technology from Apple, Baidu and especially Google, the company has taken strides to bring as much mapping expertise in-house as possible. Microsoft said the deal on Monday was part of a broader strategy to focus on its core products.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch Hasn\\'t Killed Fitbit:\\xa0Two months after the Apple Watch launch, the leading wrist-based fitness tracking company is doing just fine. The Apple Watch was expected to be a disaster for companies like Fitbit. It hasn’t been. While Fitbit’s sales dipped as anticipation for Apple’s smartwatch grew, the company has bounced back this spring and appears to be doing just fine, according to data provided exclusively to Bloomberg by Slice Intelligence. After Apple’s monster first week, Fitbit products have actually outsold Apple Watches, according to Slice. Slice collects data from the e-mailed receipts of about 2.5 million people. Over the past year, Fitbit has outsold the rest of the fitness tracking market combined (excluding Apple). While the entire industry saw a bump during last year’s holiday season, companies such as Jawbone, Garmin, and Samsung saw their wearable sales decline quickly after Christmas. Fitbit’s never dropped to their pre-holiday levels, and began ramping up again this spring. People are seeking out Fitbit products specifically. When people buy Fitbit products online, the most common place they’re doing it is on the company’s own website. More than 43 percent of Fitbit sales take place on Fitbit.com, slightly edging out Amazon, which accounts for 40 percent of online sales of Fitbit devices. Apple Watch\\'s and Fitbit\\'s consumer bases don’t overlap much. Fitbit is tightly focused on fitness. Apple pitches its product as a more general-use device. There\\'s also a significant difference in price, with Fitbit devices ranging from $60 to $250 and the Apple watch starting at $350 and going straight up to ridiculous. According to Slice, less than 5 percent of people who bought a Fitbit since the end of 2013 have also purchased an Apple Watch. For now, it seems like there’s room in wearable computing for both companies—but maybe not anyone else.\\n\\nQuikr is reportedly in talks to acquire Housing.com:\\xa0Online classifieds firm Quikr is in talks to acquire real estate portal Housing.com.When contacted, co-founder and CEO of Housing.com Rahul Yadav confirmed the news but only to retract it later. SoftBank had invested in the promising online realty startup close to $90 million in December 2014 valuing the company around $270 million. SoftBank is said to have initiated talks with the potential acquirer Quikr, which has been looking to strengthen its newly launched property sales vertical QuikrHomes by way of inorganic expansion. The sale efforts seem to have been initiated by its investors as they are trying to salvage their investment in the company.\\n\\nWith New Budgeting Tools, AWS Makes It Easier For Developers To Manage Costs:\\xa0Amazon today announced two new tools that make it easier for developers to control their expenses on its AWS cloud computing platform. The first tool, called Budgets, allows AWS users to define a monthly budget for their AWS cost. As the name implies, this means you can now set up a budget for all of your AWS spending, or set up a specific budget for just the EC2 service, for example. Then, when you get close to exceeding your monthly budget — or when your forecasted cost exceeds 100 percent — AWS will send you an alert. In addition, AWS is launching a new tool for its Cost Explorer service today that tries to forecast monthly cost up to three months into the future. This service can look at data on an aggregate level, but more interestingly, it can look at specific services, tags, availability zones, purchase options and API operations. Given that there is probably some variability in how you use AWS in a given month, the service will also show confidence intervals for its prediction. Estimating AWS cost is something of an arcane art, which is only complicated by Amazon’s granular pricing structure. The more complex the app you’re hosting on AWS, the harder it gets to figure out how much it’ll cost to run it on Amazon’s service (which also makes it hard to compare AWS cost to other cloud platforms). These new services will hopefully make it a bit easier to at least keep track of AWS cost without having to resort to third-party tools.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an MP3 version of this snippet\\n\\n\\nZestFinance and JD.com announce a joint venture to provide a consumer credit scoring service in China, rivaling Alibaba\\'s offering:\\xa0The venture, JD-ZestFinance Gaia, will initially be used to assess credit risk and offer installment loans for purchases on JD.com, which has 100 million active customers and generates yearly revenue of $20 billion. The venture intends to eventually offer the credit-analysis service to corporate customers throughout China. JD.com is also making a minority investment in ZestFinance, though the companies would not disclose the size of the investment or the valuation of the start-up. There is a lot of enthusiasm for the data science approach to credit analysis, and venture funding is flowing into this emerging field. The promise is that high-tech tools can give greater depth and detail to the basic principle of banking: know your customer. Start-ups in the field, beside ZestFinance, include Affirm, Earnest, Elevate and LendUp. The start-ups’ methods vary, as do the data sources they tap. But their algorithms sift through data that can include a person’s social-network connections, web-browsing habits, how they fill out online forms and their online purchases. The software looks for patterns and correlations: digital signals that help assess an individual’s willingness and ability to repay. China’s leaders are seeking to stimulate consumer spending to make its economy less dependent on industrial exports. Expanding consumer credit is part of the formula, and the government is allowing private companies, like JD.com, to innovate. JD-ZestFinance Gaia and competitor Sesame Credit, part of Alibaba-affiliated Ant Financial Services Group, hope to use the e-commerce sites\\' vast swathes of shopping data to turn out a reliable credit risk score.\\n\\nThis Driver in China Explains How He Is Helping Rip Off Uber:\\xa0James Li was unhappy with his pay as a security guard in Shanghai so he started driving on weekends for Uber. He’s almost tripled his pay -- in part by scamming the company. Li, an alias since he feared retribution if his real name was made public, is taking advantage of Uber’s efforts to break into the China market. The U.S. car-booking company is spending millions on free rides and driver bonuses, betting the cash will help train China drivers and market Uber services to customers. Instead, people like Li have figured out how to cash in on Uber’s largesse without giving anyone a ride. He’s part of a cottage industry that has developed so drivers can use modified smartphones and software to place fake bookings and trick Uber into paying out cash for phantom trips. While there are no reliable estimates on how prevalent the scams are, interviews with Uber drivers, equipment vendors and reviews of postings on dedicated online forums suggest at least some of the $1 billion that Uber has pledged to spend to expand the service in China this year is being siphoned off by fake bookings. To create a fake trip, an Uber driver has essentially two options, according to drivers interviewed by Bloomberg. The first is a do-it-yourself option where the driver buys a hacked smartphone that can operate with multiple phone numbers and therefore multiple Uber accounts. Drivers use one number to act as a rider and request a lift, and then accept the trip as a driver with another phone number. The second option involves working with other scammers over the Internet. If a driver doesn’t have a hacked phone, he can go into one of several invitation-only online forums and request a fake fare from professional ride-bookers. These bookers are referred to as “nurses” because they use specially tailored software to put an “injection,” or location-specific ride request near the driver. The driver, or “patient,” then makes the trip while the booker monitors remotely, confirms the journey was made and then pays Uber when the trip is complete. The nurse gets a small fee, usually about $1.60, and the reimbursement for the fare from the patient. The driver in turn collects the fare and a driver bonus that can be three times the fare from Uber, which thinks it is building brand awareness by giving away free rides. The drivers interviewed by Bloomberg spoke of a cat-and-mouse game with Uber and the fear of being caught. A recent software upgrade has made it more difficult to successfully game the system, they said.\\n\\nIntuit Lays Off 399 Employees In Company Realignment:\\xa0Intuit has confirmed to TechCrunch that it has laid off 399 people, or just under 5 percent of the company’s roughly 8,000 employees, in a re-alignment of the company. Patrick Barry has also stepped back from leading Demandforce, though he remains an employee of Intuit. In the past year, Intuit’s stock has risen more than 28 percent, and the company is currently worth more than $28 billion based on its market cap. Intuit is best known for its tax preparation services like TurboTax and financial services like QuickBooks. In January the company partnered with Uber and Stripe to help those on-demand workers keep track of their finances. The tools help workers quickly figure out what their tax bills and write-offs will be for work-related expenses. In January, Intuit also bought ZeroPaper, a startup that offers online accounting services for small businesses, as it began to take an interest in Brazil. It also bought a payroll services startup Acrede in December this year.\\n\\nThe Mouth Is Mightier Than the Pen:\\xa0New research shows that text-based communications may make individuals sound less intelligent and employable than when the same information is communicated orally. The findings imply that old-fashioned phone conversations or in-person visits may be more effective when trying to impress a prospective employer or, perhaps, close a deal. In the first of a series of experiments presented in the paper, the researchers recruited 18 MBA. candidates from Booth. The students were asked to prepare a brief pitch to a prospective employer — a roughly two-minute proposal that the researchers recorded on video. Separately, the researchers recruited 162 people who were visiting the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago to evaluate these pitches. Some of these museum-goers watched the video, a second group listened to the audio without watching the video, and a third group read a transcript of the pitch. What the researchers found was that the evaluators who heard the pitches — whether in the audio or video version — “rated the candidates intellect more highly” than those who read the transcript, the paper reported. Those who listened or watched also rated the candidates more likable and, critically, more employable. The results are said to validate and expand upon previous research showing that the cadence and intonation of voice allows listeners to do a better job of gauging a person’s thoughts than the same information communicated in writing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an MP3 version of this snippet\\n\\n\\nMarketers Will Drool Over Facebook’s New Signup Ads That Auto-Fill Your Email Or Number:\\xa0Businesses desperately want your email address, but it’s annoying to enter it on mobile. Cue Facebook’s latest News Feed ads. A marketer can buy an ad asking for you to sign-up for a newsletter or request a sales call, and with two-taps you can auto-fill your email address, phone number, or other info you’ve registered with Facebook. Facebook is testing these “Lead Ads” with a small group of businesses around the world to gain feedback before considering rolling them out. Google has tested similar contact form ads for years, but they always required users to manually enter their info. To make Facebook’s ads privacy-friendly, Facebook won’t just hand your info over. You have to click the call-to-action button like “Subscribe,” and then “Submit” your info once you’ve reviewed what was auto-filled. Users can edit that info inside the ads, and businesses only get what’s voluntarily submitted. From there, advertisers can only use the data in accordance with a mini-privacy policy they embed in the ad, and can’t resell it to anyone else. Rather than ads that lead you offsite to fill out sign-up forms, it’s pulling that experience into the News Feed, so when you’re done, you keep right on social networking. Removing the click away and manual data entry could drastically boost conversion rates on these kinds of ads, making them easier to sell at higher prices.\\n\\nAlibaba affiliate launches Internet bank for small enterprises:\\xa0Alibaba\\'s financial affiliate launched on Thursday Internet bank MYbank, targeting the small- and medium-sized Chinese enterprises that have struggled to obtain credit from major financial institutions. MYbank, which is 30-percent owned by Alibaba-linked Ant Financial Services Group, has 4 billion yuan ($644 million) of registered capital and will offer loans of up to 5 million yuan. It will only be able to take in deposits when regulators approve a facial recognition technology that allow its customers to remotely open bank accounts, an Ant Financial spokeswoman told Reuters. MYbank follows in the footsteps of Alibaba arch-rival Tencent Holdings Ltd, which began trial operations of its WeBank, China\\'s first online bank, in January. Credit conditions have remained tight for SMEs, despite a series of policy easing, as banks avoid the companies worst hit by an economic slowdown. State-owned banks have also avoided customers such as farmers and smaller businesses because of the difficulties in assessing their credit worthiness and they have little to offer as collateral.\\n\\nClashes Erupt Across France as Taxi Drivers Protest Uber:\\xa0Irate taxi drivers blocked roads, burned tires and attacked drivers who they thought were working for Uber, the ride-hailing company, during a day of protests Thursday that disrupted Paris and slowed traffic to a crawl. Fights broke out on streets, a couple of cars were burned and travelers were frustrated all over Paris and in major cities elsewhere in France, where the labor battle snarled several cities’ streets. “Economic terrorism” is the favored term of Parisian taxi drivers for Uber’s lower prices, flexible hours and the way it is operating outside French law. In France the UberPop service is illegal. It allows anyone who wants to become a driver to sign up without a professional chauffeur license and to pick up fares through the Uber smartphone app. Other Uber services are permitted under strict conditions, and the company is contesting the constitutionality of parts of the law limiting UberPop. The company has instructed its drivers to keep working. The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, who met Thursday evening with the taxi unions, deplored the violence, but saved his most angry words for Uber. He said the company behaved with “arrogance” in its flouting of French law and declared that “the government will never accept the law of the jungle,” referring to Uber’s stark form of competition.\\n\\nAmazon wants the Echo to be your personal robot butler:\\xa0Amazon\\'s fuller ambitions for the Echo and its Alexa cloud-based voice software have become a little clearer. The company announced Thursday that it is opening up the system to developers, so that anyone can design their own programs to work with the sleek cylindrical in-home assistant. The company announced that its new developer\\'s kit will make it easy for programmers to work with the device, even without previous knowledge of how to work with voice-recognition systems. That means amateur and professional developers alike can make programs for themselves. That means they could make custom commands for smart appliances such as thermostats and sprinklers, or custom programs that work with Web sites so you can get news updates fed to your Echo. It also means Amazon\\'s set up the Echo to potentially be the central point from which you run your whole life. The Echo itself can\\'t vacuum your home, but it could theoretically tell your vacuum when to start going. It may not do your dishes, but it can prompt your dishwasher to fire up as well. So while it won\\'t be your robot maid, it could theoretically be your robot butler. Earlier this week, Amazon began selling the Echo widely -- it had previously been an invite-only device. Those moves set Amazon up a little more solidly as a competitor to Apple and Google, which have also laid out ambitions to create hubs for the smart homes of the future. Earlier this week, Apple released a new set of home-related prompts that will work with its Siri voice assistant for individual smart devices -- \"turn on the coffee maker\" -- as well as for groups of smart devices. So you can tell Siri to \"turn off the upstairs lights,\" for example, if you want to save a little energy while your family is gathered in the living room.\\n\\nIBM Pushes Networking and Research to Catch Rivals in the Cloud - Mulls India Data Center:\\xa0IBM will expand the networking services available through its SoftLayer cloud technology, trying to catch up with deep-pocketed rivals. IBM researchers and engineers are now making regular trips to SoftLayer’s headquarters in Dallas to discuss product plans and get educated about cloud operation, said Marc Jones, SoftLayer’s chief technology officer. Increasing cloud revenue is critical for IBM. It has tried to boost sales for operations like cloud computing and data analytics but that hasn’t been enough to make up for declines in longstanding operations -- such as services and hardware -- and revenue lost from divestitures. The initiative comes almost two years after the Armonk, New York-based company acquired SoftLayer for $2 billion to help IBM compete against Google, Microsoft and Amazon. SoftLayer also plans to open a data center in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and is looking at a location in India.\\n\\nUber growing 40% month-over-month in India: Uber’s Asia Head:\\xa0Uber may have had its share of challenges in the Indian market, but the ride sharing app has been growing at over 40 per cent month-over-month here. In fact, Bangalore and Kolkata are some of the fastest growing cities for Uber globally, Eric Alexander, Head of Business, Asia, Uber told Techcircle. The team at Uber India has their work cut out. The regulatory overhang over Uber, which started after a passengers’ sexual assault by an Uber driver in December, continues to play out. It has been facing ban calls in Delhi and other places. Earlier, it came under the RBI scanner over its payment system which automatically debited a user’s credit card after a ride.\\n\\nAmazon Puts a Store on Wheels, Continues to Flirt With Physical Retail:\\xa0Amazon continues to explore new ways to bridge the gap between online and offline retail, even if the most recent example seems stunt-ish. The company today is introducing the Amazon Treasure Truck in Seattle, which will carry a limited quantity of one product each day that shoppers can order on Amazon’s app and then collect from the truck at a designated pickup location. The company said the truck will feature hard-to-find, heavily discounted or limited edition products and food, ranging from paddle boards to beach bikes to steak — yes, steak. The Treasure Truck introduction comes as Amazon flirts with physical retail: Amazon product vending machines have popped up in some airports, and a recent patent application lays out a vision for a new kind of technologically advanced retail store.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an MP3 version of this snippet\\n\\n\\nDriven by smart acquisitions, Facebook stock at all-time high; Company valued at ~$250 billion\\xa0:\\xa0Facebook set an all-time high today, closing at $88.86 per share, valuing the company at just under $250 billion. However, what’s most interesting in the Facebook bump isn’t the simple fact that it is now worth more — shares and markets gyrate. Instead, it’s the reasons why analysts are more bullish that are notable: Piper cited the Oculus Rift headset as a coming revenue source, while RBC gave the top line potential of Instagram as key to Facebook’s value. Translating those points slightly, it seems that investors are taking into account the revenue side of Facebook’s past purchases, and are adjusting their expectations higher as those acquisitions mature into income streams. That concept underscores how well the social company has done its recent acquisitions.\\n\\nHow Beacons Are Helping People Network at Cannes, As Festival Tests the Technology for a Second Year:\\xa0The Cannes Lions festival is testing out beacon technology in the official Cannes Lions app for the second year in row, upping the number of location-based devices set up around venues from fewer than 10 last year to 100. The Around Me section of the app employs location-based targeting to find people who have check into venues. Festival goers can also see which sessions are the buzziest. On top of the geo-targeting, the app crawls LinkedIn profiles to connect online connections offline. And as many ad executives know from cold LinkedIn pitches, that often means meeting someone in real life for the first time. The app sends out mass push notifications to everyone about schedule changes and information about the event. If the beacons detect that someone has stayed in a session for 15 minutes or more, the app will automatically save the session as a favorite. The liked panels then serve as a virtual icebreaker for attendees to find common interests.\\n\\nWhat Online Retailers Should Know About Amazon Business:\\xa0Amazon Business has replaced AmazonSupply. Amazon Business features a simplified layout with fewer ads and includes products suitable for business purchase. Plus, unlike AmazonSupply, third-party sellers are invited to join Amazon Business. Sellers must be approved to sell on Amazon Business. There are 45 active professional categories within this new marketplace umbrella. To be accepted on Amazon Business, you must meet a sales minimum and have an acceptable seller rating to demonstrate a high level of customer satisfaction. Once approved, you’ll need to set up a Business profile. You’ll then be able to use special features like business-only pricing, quantity-based pricing and more. Buyers must be approved to buy on Amazon Business. To get a buying account on Amazon Business, shoppers need to create a new account and register tax information. Once done, they can add buyers and share payment and shipping information. Amazon Business supports business credentials. Credentials include “ISO 9001 certified,” “Minority Owned” and other quality, sourcing and social responsibility goals.\\n\\nThe Internet of Things Has Vast Economic Potential, McKinsey Report Says:\\xa0A study by the McKinsey Global Institute predicts that the Internet of things, a term for sensor-laden machines connected to the web, will in the year 2025 create between nearly $4 trillion to $11 trillion in economic benefits globally. That includes profits to device-makers, efficiencies, new businesses and savings to consumers from better-run products. It is difficult to measure the current economic benefit though, because most people now working with the technology are still in the early investment phase. The biggest gains will be made by companies that figure out how to adapt to the new technology, the report said. On an oil-drilling platform, for example, this might mean knowing by the temperature or chemical changes in a pump that something may have happened upstream, away from the pump. In managing city traffic, this could mean learning how to correctly balance information from cars, roads and traffic lights. “This puts a premium on predicting incidents based on data from a multitude of sources,” said Michael Chui, one of the report’s authors. But it will be a challenge for companies to find ways to both organize and take advantage of that information.\\n\\nDropbox Is Struggling and Competitors Are Catching Up:\\xa0Dropbox made itself a household name by giving away cloud storage. The eight-year-old company, valued at $10 billion, had 300 million registered users a year ago; now it’s got 400 million. Its two-year-old effort to make money from business users has been less impressive. While Dropbox led the $904 million global market for business file-sharing last year with about a 24 percent share, No.?2 Box and No.?3 Microsoft each took about 21 percent and doubled their slice of the pie, growing almost twice as fast, according to researcher IDC.\\n\\nNow you can use Facebook Messenger without Facebook:\\xa0Are you one of the 1.44 billion people who use Facebook? Then this post isn\\'t for you. The company made an announcement Wednesday for those other folks -- the Facebook holdouts who are probably tired of being pestered by their friends to give in and sign up already. Now they can talk to their friends on Facebook without having to open account, via Messenger. The option is limited, for now, to people in the United States, Canada, Peru and Venezuela. But non-Facebook users in those countries can use all of the Messenger features, including group and multimedia messaging, by simply signing up for a Messenger account. \"With this update, more people can enjoy all the features that are available on Messenger – including photos, videos, group chats, voice and video calling, stickers and more,\" the company said in an official blog post. \"All you need is a phone number.\"Communication, generally, has become a bigger focus for Facebook, which is attempting to to build a family of social apps that extends beyond its core social network. Giving Messenger a larger potential install base is an easy way for Facebook to continue that spread, although its growth shouldn\\'t worry WhatsApp users. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has made clear that he has no plans to merge the two services any time soon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an MP3 version of this snippet\\n\\n\\nGloves Off in China as Banks, Alibaba Invade Each Other’s Turf:\\xa0This week, Alibaba is launching MYbank, an online lender that will tap into Chinese savers’ record $7.8 trillion of deposits and a banking revenue stream that’s forecast to double by 2020. Banks have been striking back by pushing into the business Ma pioneered in China, online malls. The moves are blurring the lines between banking and e-commerce as China’s government continues encouraging competition in the finance industry and as Chinese increasingly use computers and mobile phones to bank and shop. “China’s banks have woken up and realized that the challenge from Alibaba’s entry into banking is for real,” said David He, a Hong Kong-based partner and managing director at Boston Consulting Group Inc. “For them, doing e-commerce is a defense as well as a counterattack.” Banking giant ICBC, which as the world’s most profitable company dwarfs Alibaba’s net income by more than 10 times, set up a platform allowing retailers to sell the bank’s customers wine, shampoo, appliances and more. China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and others are also getting into the action. ICBC’s site, called Easy to Buy, is forecasting sales of 300 billion yuan this year, after tallying 130 billion yuan so far since January. By comparison at Alibaba, its Tmall logged 763 billion yuan in sales last year. JD.com ranked second at 260 billion yuan.\\n\\nGoogle launches free streaming service ahead of Apple Music debut:\\xa0Google launched a free version of its music streaming service on Tuesday, as it sought to upstage the debut of Apple\\'s rival service next week. Google Play Music has offered a $9.99 per month subscription service for two years but Tuesday\\'s launch is the first free version of the streaming service. It is available online and will be available on Android and iOS by the end of the week, Elias Roman, Google product manager, said. Apple said earlier this month it would launch a music streaming service on June 30 for $9.99 per month along with a $14.99 per month family plan, with a free three-month trial. As with other streaming services, such as Spotify and Rhapsody, Google Play Music curates playlists. Users can tailor playlists based on genre, artist or even activity, such as hosting a pool party or \"having fun at work. Unlike Google\\'s subscription music service, the free service will carry ads, be unavailable offline and exclude certain songs.\\n\\nInstagram Overhauls Search Feature to Surface More Trending News:\\xa0Instagram unveiled a massive overhaul to its search feature on Tuesday in an effort to bring users into the app more often, particularly during breaking news events. The new feature lets users search for images by location and includes a section for trending places and hashtags, none of which was available before. The trending places feature will surface both local and national trends so topics will differ based on your location. Instagram is also getting into the curation game that has become popular with other social networks like Snapchat and Twitter over the past few months. Instagram will feature two themed, rotating categories at a time with titles like “Extreme Athletes” or “Towering Rocks.” The images in these feeds will be selected based on a mix of computer algorithm and human curation by the company’s community team. Instagram is often lauded for its simplicity. But in the case of Instagram’s old search feature, simplicity may have actually been holding the app back. The old version of the app allowed for hashtag and people searches, but required different tabs for each. The new search feature will return hashtags, people and locations all from the same search bar in addition to the new trending sections. A useful search tab should benefit Instagram in multiple ways. For starters, it’ll help people find more content they want to see and make the app more useful in the process. More importantly may be the trending places and hashtags feature. Systrom says that Instagram can be a place for news, where people go to learn about and follow along with the day’s important trending topics.\\n\\nReport suggests millions of Uber rides in China are fakes reported by drivers in order to collect Uber’s high driver subsidies.:\\xa0A new report on Chinese tech site Tencent Tech suggests that millions of Uber’s booked rides in the country are fakes – fraudulent fares reported by drivers in order to collect Uber’s high driver subsidies. Faking fares – which some drivers refer to as “acupuncture” – works like this: first, you buy an Uber driver account. There are plenty available for sale on sites like Taobao, and many even come with helpful “how to fake rides” guides. Once you’ve got your account, you partner up with a passenger using the consumer Uber app. With location services turned off, the passenger submits a fare from point A to point B. You drive the fare with no passenger, return the money paid by the passenger, and then split the driver subsidies Uber will pay you – which may be several times the price of the fare itself. This “acupuncture” phenomenon it doesn’t only affect Uber. But drivers told Tencent Tech that because Uber’s subsidies are the highest, virtually all of the faking right now is taking place on Uber’s platform because it is the most profitable. Uber reportedly does have the technological capability to shut down fake rides entirely, but is concerned that doing so would slow its genuine organic growth because being overly strict could result in false positives, banning real drivers and passengers who aren’t cheating the system.\\n\\nQualcomm in Venture With Chinese Chip Maker:\\xa0China’s largest maker of chips has a new plan to help it close a wide gap with rivals, and the company has found some unlikely partners to help. The company, the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, also known as S.M.I.C., said on Tuesday that it would form a new company with a leading Belgian microelectronics research center and Qualcomm, the American chip giant, to help it develop and produce new generations of advanced semiconductors that work as the brains of numerous electronics products, like smartphones and servers. Four months ago, China imposed a $975 million fine on Qualcomm, saying it violated anti-monopoly law, and forced it to reduce sharply the licensing fees it charges Chinese smartphone makers for its communications chips. This really is Qualcomm playing nice with the Chinese government,” said Mark Hung, a semiconductor analyst with Gartner. Chinese companies like SMIC. have greatly lagged behind rivals like Samsung Electronics and Intel, partly because of export restrictions on the sophisticated tools and machines required to produce the most advanced chips. In 2013, China imported $232 billion worth of semiconductor materials, more than it spent on petroleum. To close the gap, Beijing has pledged a huge amount of resources. “The Chinese government has been very persistent and insistent in their policies. They want local chip manufacturing there, and this is another leak in the dike. It’s another part of the steady progress on their side.”\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

In a draft paper for moving towards cashless economy and reduce tax avoidance, the government also proposed to make it mandatory to settle high value transactions of more than Rs 1 lakh through electronic mode. In order to incentivise shopkeepers, it has proposed tax rebate to them provided they accept a significant value of sales through debit or credit cards. The proposals are aimed at building a transactions history of an individual to enable improved credit access and financial inclusion, reduce tax avoidance and check counterfeiting of currency. “Tax benefits in terms of income tax rebates to be considered to consumers for paying a certain proportion of their expenditure through electronic means,” said that draft proposals for facilitating electronic transactions on which the government has invited comments till June 29. The paper said the tax benefits could be provided to merchants for accepting electronic payments. “An appropriate tax rebate can be extended to a merchant if at least say 50 per cent value of the transactions is through electronic means. Alternatively, 1-2 per cent reduction in value added tax could be considered on all electronic transactions by the merchants,” it added.\\n\\nFacebook gaining ground on YouTube in video ads:\\xa0Facebook is gaining ground on Google\\'s YouTube as an outlet for big companies to market their products via online videos, the fastest growing category of Internet ads, a report published on Monday said. London-based Ampere predicts a new advertising \"arms race\" between the two rivals, neck and neck in terms of audience sizes with around 1.4 billion to 1.3 billion monthly active users, respectively for Facebook and YouTube. Facebook is morphing from a platform most advertisers use for building general brand awareness to one that can deliver \"pre-roll\" advertisements that marketing companies prefer for ensuring their messages are actually viewed. Currently, YouTube remains a more flexible marketing platform, offering advertisers the full range of video ads which run before, during or after a video program is shown. Differences in ad formats translate into the rates the Internet platforms can charge advertisers. While YouTube charges advertisers when an advertisement has been viewed, Facebook offers the less advertiser-friendly model of charging once three seconds of the video have been delivered, Ampere noted. Most content providers now use Facebook for branding and awareness purposes, but trial revenue-sharing deals with the National Football League and Fox Sports in the United States pose a serious challenger to YouTube\\'s lead. Online video is now growing faster than any other digital category or subcategory, rising 33 percent in 2014, and is forecast to grow 29 percent a year through 2017, Zenith said.\\n\\nOracle extends cloud offerings, looks to compete with Amazon:\\xa0Oracle Corp founder and Executive Chairman Larry Ellison said his database company is expanding its cloud-computing offerings, bringing Oracle into more direct competition with Amazon. \"We\\'re prepared to compete with Amazon.com on price,\" said Ellison in a webcast presentation on Monday, after announcing that Oracle would offer online storage and capability for customers to run their applications entirely in Oracle\\'s cloud. The expansion is a major new step for Oracle, which is shifting its traditional database and customer relationship management businesses to the cloud. Oracle, which calls its cloud offering the Oracle Cloud Platform, will provide a cost-effective alternative to Amazon, said Ellison. \"Our new archive storage service goes head-to-head with Amazon Glacier and it\\'s one-tenth their price,\" said Ellison. Amazon did not immediately return a request for comment. Oracle\\'s cloud business is growing quickly, running at a rate of about $2.3 billion a year in revenue, based on last quarter\\'s figures. By comparison, Amazon and Microsoft get about $6.3 billion each in cloud revenue per year.\\n\\nTech Titans Come Together To Develop Common Container Standard:\\xa0Docker, CoreOS, Google, Microsoft and Amazon are now working on a new standard for software containers with the help of the Linux Foundation. Docker may have become synonymous with containers, but it’s not the only container format around and not everybody agrees that it should become the standard format. Docker and CoreOS had looked like they were on a collision course, and having even more container formats wasn’t likely going to help the overall ecosystem. Now, however, the two companies are going to work together with other stakeholders on the Open Container Project (OCP), which will be housed under the Linux Foundation. The OCP is a nonprofit organization that is “chartered to establish common standards for software containers.” The Docker container format and runtime will form the basis of the new standard, and Docker is donating both the draft specifications and the code around its image format and runtime engine to get the project started. The main idea here is that developers should be able to package their applications in a container and be confident that it will run in any runtime, whether that’s Docker, CoreOS’s rkt, or projects like Kurma or Jetpack. That standard should be vendor neutral and development should happen out in the open. Containers are isolated user instances that allow applications to be deployed easily; Docker uses resource isolation features of the Linux kernel such as cgroups and kernel namespaces to allow independent \"containers\" to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines.\\n\\nAs Quick as a Taylor Swift Tweet, Apple Had to Change Its Tune:\\xa0Taylor Swift’s victory in a one-day battle against Apple this week showed she has a rare power to influence the music business itself, at a time of deep anxiety among artists big and small about the value of their work. On Sunday morning, Ms. Swift wrote a diplomatic but stern Tumblr post taking Apple to task for not paying royalties on test drives of its new streaming music service, set to open on June 30. “We don’t ask you for free iPhones,” she wrote. “Please don’t ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.” By midnight Sunday, Apple — one of the most powerful companies in the world — had capitulated to the 25-year-old pop star, saying it would pay royalties on all music for the three-month trials. One of its senior executives, Eddy Cue, even said he called Ms. Swift personally to give her the news. The backdrop to that decision was much more complex than the quick exchange might have indicated. For more than a week, independent labels around the world had been complaining about Apple’s proposed terms, saying that even for 90 days, a big drop in revenue from Apple — by far the music industry’s largest sales outlet — could be devastating. But even though Mr. Cue carefully noted in interviews that the company’s decision had been made with those labels in mind, its hurried announcement late Sunday suggested that it was Ms. Swift’s shaming that led Apple to change its tune. “She is the most powerful person in the music industry,” said David Lowery of the bands Cracker and Camper Van Beethoven, and an advocate for artists’ rights. “She is able to bring the debate to the mainstream.”\\n\\nUber Is Negotiating a $2 Billion Credit Line With Banks:\\xa0Uber is negotiating a $2 billion credit line from a group of Wall Street banks. The car-booking company that has roiled transportation markets worldwide by letting people hail rides from their smartphones, had initially sought a $1 billion revolving loan before boosting the size as more banks sought to participate, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday. San Francisco-based Uber raised $1.6 billion in convertible debt at the beginning of the year from Goldman Sach’s wealth-management clients\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAn\\xa0MP3\\xa0version of this snippet is here\\n\\n\\nAmazon Upgrades Its Review Software:\\xa0Amazon is giving its reviews system an overhaul, using new software it says will surface more helpful commentary from buyers. The company says it is using machine learning to provide more frequent, more useful updates to reviews on its U.S. site. Among other things, that means that more recent reviews will show up near the top of a product listing, and a product’s five star review score may change more often. Via CNET: “The new system will give more weight to newer reviews, reviews from verified Amazon purchasers and those that more customers vote up as being helpful. A product’s 5-star rating, which previously was a pure average of all reviews, will also become weighted using those same criteria.” While Amazon doesn’t mention this, it’s also reasonable to assume that the company hopes the overhaul will help push down bogus reviews, a problem that has long-plagued the site but which it usually doesn’t want to talk about.\\n\\nTwitter Expands Shopping Experience With Product Pages:\\xa0Twitter is finally taking advantage of its massive amount of tweet data to encourage its users to shop.The social network is rolling out product pages and what the company calls Collections on Friday, distinct pages within the service where you can see info on specific products or places and actually make a purchase. A product page will include things like tweets about the product, user reviews, pricing and, in some cases, a buy button. Collections are more of a browsing experience, which include a handful of recommended products and places selected by a brand or high-profile curator. For example, Ellen DeGeneres has a Collection highlighting the “Best of the Ellen Shop,” where you can browse Ellen-branded products or others she has featured on her show. The new feature is a pretty expansive change to Twitter’s previous shopping experiments. Those were limited to promoted tweets that included a buy button for a single item. The Collections and product pages aim to take advantage of the fact that Twitter already has lots of information about products and services from its user base. It’s now collecting that info to help educate a potential buyer. For now, Twitter is simply getting the product off the ground and isn’t taking a cut of sales revenue from most partners, but taking a slice off the top seems like a logical next step.\\n\\nHow Oculus and Cardboard Are Going to Rock the Travel Industry:\\xa0Relegated to geeky fantasy for years, Virtual Reality hardware is suddenly cheap, portable, and there for the travel-brand taking. Travel companies such as Thomas Cook, Qantas Airways, and Destination BC in Canada are also creating their own promotional VR videos. Currently, in 10 select Thomas Cook store locations in the U.K., Germany, and Belgium, you can strap on a Gear VR headset and try your tour before you buy: Walk through the billowing blue curtains of a Santorini hotel balcony, ride a helicopter above Manhattan\\'s skyline. This year Cook has seen VR-promoted New York excursion revenue increase 190 percent. The next step, according to Ryan, is to go beyond brick-and-mortar stores and deliver VR brochures into homes.\\n\\nChina to promote cross-border e-commerce as incomes rise:\\xa0China will increase support for cross-border e-commerce as the world\\'s second-largest economy shifts from manufacturing to higher-value services, the government said. The government released policy guidelines on Saturday that include tax policies aimed at boosting domestic consumption and pilot projects to ease overseas payments. Chinese e-commerce firms will be given state support on international projects while credit insurance services will also be introduced. Customs will streamline clearance of goods and quality supervision agencies will allow collective declaration, examination and release of goods. There will be tax sweeteners on e-commerce retail exports and settlement of payments in yuan will be promoted, it added. The policy document followed Friday\\'s announcement that China will allow full foreign ownership of some e-commerce business to boost competitiveness.\\n\\nChinese firms pour money into U.S. Research and Development in shift to innovation:\\xa0Surging investment by Chinese companies in U.S. research labs is yielding a fast-growing trove of patents, part of a push to mine America for ideas to help China shift from being the world\\'s factory floor to a driver of innovation. Largely absent from American research hubs a decade ago, Chinese firms including Huawei and ZTE Corp are now using U.S. researchers to create patents ranging from new software to internet infrastructure, according to an analysis of Thomson Reuters\\' global intellectual property database. Patented inventions by Chinese firms that involved at least one U.S. researcher roughly doubled worldwide in each of the last three years, reaching 910 in 2014.\\n\\nAttack Gave Chinese Hackers Privileged Access to U.S. Systems:\\xa0Undetected for nearly a year, the Chinese intruders executed a sophisticated attack that gave them “administrator privileges” into US government networks. The hackers began siphoning out a rush of data after constructing what amounted to an electronic pipeline that led back to China, investigators told Congress last week in classified briefings. The hackers’ ultimate target: the one million or so federal employees and contractors who have filled out a form known as SF-86, which is stored in a different computer bank and details personal, financial and medical histories for anyone seeking a security clearance. “This was classic espionage, just on a scale we’ve never seen before from a traditional adversary”\\n\\nUS carrier Sprint bows to net neutrality, saying it won’t throttle data anymore:\\xa0To make sure it stays on the right side of net neutrality, Sprint will no longer slow down its customers\\' mobile data when its cell sites are congested, the company says. The decision is an early sign that the federal government\\'s new rules for Internet providers are having an effect. Sprint\\'s policy, which it said lasted for less than a year, was to slow down mobile data temporarily for data hogs in a congested area. The throttling affected the heaviest 5 percent of data users covered by a given cell site, and when the congestion eased, the restrictions were lifted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an MP3 version of this snippet\\n\\n\\nAlibaba Finance Arm Is Valued Above $40 Billion in Latest Funding Round:\\xa0Alibaba’s finance affiliate, which runs China’s biggest online payments business, closed a private placement valuing the unit at more than $40 billion, according to two people familiar with the matter. Ant Financial sold stakes to external investors, including China Development Bank Capital Company. China’s National Social Security Fund has become a strategic investor, the finance arm said on its official microblog account, without giving details of the investment. The pension fund acquired about 5 percent. Ma spun off the finance operations into a new company he controls in 2011, citing the risk of foreign ownership restrictions. Yahoo and SoftBank held a majority of Alibaba at the time. Prior to Alibaba\\'s record $25 billion IPO in September, the companies struck a new deal that entitled the e-commerce operator to a share of earnings at Ant Financial, which is moving into new businesses, including money-market funds. Alipay, which has more than 800 million registered users, is a service similar to PayPal. Alibaba is entitled to either a third of Ant Financial shares or a one-time payout equal to 37.5 percent of the equity value, according to Alibaba’s IPO prospectus. Alibaba also holds perpetual claim to 37.5 percent of Ant Financial’s pretax earnings until it receives a third of the financial arm’s equity.\\n\\nChinese government deals help nurse Alibaba\\'s bottom dog cloud business:\\xa0Alibaba is an underdog in the global cloud computing industry, but it has one thing going for it: it\\'s Chinese. The firm scored a minor deal with China\\'s northeastern port city of Dalian to build a cloud computing center and provide online government services such as bill payment.The pact is a small part of a growing portfolio of similar cloud services tie-ups between Alibaba and government bodies around China and comes against a backdrop of Beijing\\'s deepening paranoia about foreign technology. The domestic alliances will help Alibaba\\'s cloud unit Aliyun, literally \"Ali Cloud\", build scale and gain experience before any global campaign to challenge market leaders Amazon.com, Microsoft and Google. \"China wants control of its information, of its data, of its news, of its technology food chain, and so there are huge opportunities.\" For the time being, Aliyun is small.It accounted for just 1 percent of Alibaba\\'s overall revenue for the year ended March 31. But it says in China it has the biggest market share in cloud computing. Aliyun has forged cloud agreements with more than a dozen Chinese provinces and cities including Hainan, Guangdong, Tianjin and Shanghai. It also works with China Meteorological Administration, China Central Government Procurement Center and the state railway service center. The deals range from developing cloud storage solutions to helping the government of the southern province of Guizhou gather and crunch data to optimize its traffic lights. Aliyun in April announced a deal with state oil and gas giant Sinopec, to create a cloud system to track its petrochemical production chain and emissions. Cheng Jing, an Aliyun director who deals with government agencies, said his primary consideration was the bottom line. \"First, we have to be sure that our services can make money. If these services can also promote Ali\\'s relationship with the government then that\\'s a good thing.\"\\n\\nTraders bet on Twitter near-term gains as takeover chatter persists:\\xa0Dick Costolo\\'s decision to step down as Twitter\\'s chief executive last week failed to stem the weeks-long slide in the company\\'s shares, but options traders appear to be betting on a near-term rebound. The stock has shed more than a third of its value since Twitter reported first-quarter results in April. It edged up 6 cents to $34.62 on Thursday, after touching a year-low of $33.51 on Tuesday. Since May, open interest in calls, usually used for bets on the shares rising, has swelled at a faster pace than the open interest in puts. For every open put contract, 1.7 calls are open, the most bullish for this ratio since early March. Traders have bid up near-dated options, with the demand for upside reflected in options skew - the difference between expectations for volatility priced into puts versus calls. Normally, puts tend to have a higher premium relative to calls, because people are willing to PAY more to protect against risk of losses. For Twitter, calls have become more expensive than puts. \"The upside skew in Twitter most likely reflects the possibility of an upside event between now and July expiration,\" Place said.\"It seems that everyone and their uncle is betting that Twitter will be bought by another firm\"\\n\\nA Fearless,“Fail fast, fail often” Culture Fuels America\\'s Tech Culture, and Why Europe Trails:\\xa0Here’s a stark comparison: In the United States, three of the top 10 companies by market capitalization are technology companies founded in the last half-century: Apple, Microsoft and Google. In Europe, there are none among the top 10. There are institutional and structural barriers to innovation in Europe, like smaller pools of venture capital and rigid employment laws that restrict growth.Often overlooked in the success of American start-ups is the even greater number of failures. “Fail fast, fail often” is a Silicon Valley mantra, and the freedom to innovate is inextricably linked to the freedom to fail. In Europe, failure carries a much greater stigma than it does in the United States. Bankruptcy codes are far more punitive, in contrast to the United States, where bankruptcy is simply a rite of passage for many successful entrepreneurs. There is also little or no stigma in Silicon Valley to being fired; Steve Jobs himself was forced out of Apple. Europeans are also much less receptive to the kind of truly disruptive innovation represented by a Google or a Facebook\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an MP3 version of this snippet\\n\\n\\nProfitable and Growing Fast, Fitbit Prices I.P.O. at $4.1 Billion Valuation, Above Top of Its Range:\\xa0Fitbit begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday under the symbol FIT. The company, which sells popular wearable fitness-tracking devices like the Fitbit Surge bracelet, priced its initial public offering at $20 a share on Wednesday, a dollar above its already heightened price range of $17 to $19 a share. At that level, the company will raise $732 million for itself and its selling stockholders after increasing the number of shares to be sold to 36.6 million from 34.5 million. The price values Fitbit at $4.1 billion. Its debut is a bet that consumers will continue to buy fitness bands as other, more complex smartwatches like the Apple Watch and various Android competitors hit stores. In addition to tracking users’ heart rates and steps, the newer devices offer access to email, text messages and other applications. Fitbit faces another challenge in the form of legal fights from a rival, Jawbone, which filed two lawsuits over the last month. One accuses the company of patent infringement, which could lead to a ban on importing Fitbit devices or important parts. The other accuses Fitbit of poaching employees who then illicitly stole confidential information from their former employer. Fitbit has denied those accusations. Investors for now appear undaunted by those challenges. Last year, Fitbit earned $131.8 million, reversing a nearly $52 million loss in the previous year. Its sales more than tripled during that same period, to $745.4 million.\\n\\nGitHub to Seek $2 Billion Valuation in Latest Funding Round:\\xa0GitHub, a startup that helps companies and developers build software, is seeking to raise about $200 million in a new Series B round that may value San Francisco-based GitHub about $2 billion. The company works as a social coding platform, where a software developer can display a project and others can contribute. The company says more than 8 million people use the service, and it charges monthly subscriptions to store programming source code.\\n\\nUber driver is an employee, not a contractor, California regulators say:\\xa0California\\'s Labor commission has ruled that an Uber driver was an employee, not a contractor, a potentially costly precedent for the ride-sharing company. Uber unsuccessfully argued to the commission that drivers on its ride-hailing smartphone platform aren\\'t employees, because it doesn\\'t set their hours or force them to pick up riders. The commission ruled that Uber was more than a passive platform connecting drivers and riders. Instead, the commission said in its ruling, Uber is “involved in every aspect of the operation,” vetting drivers, setting standards and establishing non-negotiable rates. The company can also kick drivers off the service if customers give them a low rating. Currently, Uber drivers take an 80 percent cut of fares, but they cover their own costs and pay their own taxes. The ruling could set a broad precedent if it is upheld. For Uber, the implications of counting its drivers as employees rather than contractors are substantial. It would suddenly have to pay for employees\\' health care benefits, worker’s compensation and payroll taxes, and be on the hook for costs like gas and car maintenance.\\n\\nOracle sales, profit miss estimates; shares fall:\\xa0Shares of Oracle, often seen as a barometer for the technology sector, fell 6 percent to $42.15 in extended trading after the company\\'s earnings report.Revenue fell 5.4 percent to $10.71 billion. Revenue rose 3 percent on a constant currency basis. Net income fell to $2.76 billion, or 62 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended May 31, from $3.65 billion, or 80 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales from Oracle\\'s cloud-computing software and platform service, an area keenly watched by investors, rose 29 percent to $416 million.\\n\\nLocation Intelligence firm AdNear expands into Europe:\\xa0Bangalore and Singapore-based AdNear Pte Ltd, which helps brands reach out to audiences by analysing time-bound location data, has ventured into Europe by establishing a beachhead in London. The company has appointed Ken Parnham, former managing director of data privacy management company TrustE, as general manager of Europe. AdNear was founded by Anil Mathews, who is also the company’s CEO, back in 2009. The company’s advertising platform is built on a proprietary hybrid geo-location platform, which helps to provide location awareness on mobile phones without GPS or operator assistance. It serves clients in India, Singapore, Australia and other Asia-Pacific countries. AdNear leverages real geo-location, combined with consumer behaviour, to target relevant users within a geo-fence. All ads are displayed within mobile apps and they ensure further engagement as users can find their way to the advertised stores and use coupons among other things. Recently, the company had raised Series B funding of $19 million from Telstra Ventures, Global Brain, Sequoia Capital and JPM Private Equity Group. In November 2012, Adnear had raised $6.3 million in Series A funding from Sequoia Capital and Canaan Partners.\\n\\n4 Microsoft Executives to Leave in Top-Level Shake-Up:\\xa0Four senior Microsoft executives, including Stephen Elop and Mark Penn, will leave the technology company in the biggest organizational shake-up yet under Satya Nadella, its chief executive. Mr. Nadella said that three of the departures were related to his decision to organize the company’s engineering efforts into fewer groups. The three executives leaving as a result are Mr. Elop, former chief executive of Nokia, who has been leading Microsoft’s devices group; Eric Rudder, leader of its advanced technology and education efforts; and Kirill Tatarinov, head of its business solutions group. While Microsoft has a long history of bureaucratic reshufflings, they do not typically involve the departure of so many executives at once. Mr. Nadella’s decision to merge several groups into others effectively left a handful of Microsoft executives without clear roles. By far, the most significant of the changes is the merging of devices, which includes Xbox, Surface tablets, smartphones and other hardware products, with the Windows organization under Mr. Myerson. By grouping hardware and operating systems under one leader, the move undoes part of the reorganization by Mr. Ballmer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an audio version of this snippet\\n\\n\\nHow A US Interest Rate Hike Could Deflate The Tech Boom:\\xa0The technology industry has benefited from low interest rates, contributing to the creation of more than 100 unicorns, startups valued at more than $1 billion. Now that economists predict a rate hike as soon as September, investors question whether the move will do what seemingly nothing else has been able to accomplish -- cool off the sector.The U.S. central bank has kept benchmark rates near zero since 2008, before companies such as Uber, Snapchat and Pinterest even existed. That means most of today’s startups haven’t been tested in an economy in which borrowing costs fluctuate. Young companies may find it harder to raise capital. It also could add stock-market volatility, making it harder to hold an initial public offering. Even the biggest beneficiaries of the boom see a shakeout coming. Chris Sacca, an investor in companies including Twitter and Uber, said too much money is flowing to technology startups that will fail in a coming industry slowdown. “Bad deals are being done,” Sacca said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “It’s kind of inevitable that the funds right now that are putting a lot of this money to work here aren’t going to see it all back.”\\n\\nAs Delivery Costs Rise, Amazon Is Building An App To Let Normal People Deliver Packages For Pay:\\xa0The Wall Street Journal reports that Amazon is working on an app internally that would allow the average consumer to make a little cash by picking up Amazon packages at various retail locations and dropping them off at their final destination. WSJ’s sources did not have a timeline for the release of this product, internally called ‘On My Way,’ and were unsure whether it would launch at all. Amazon offers its own lockers program, with pick-up stations in various locations (like parking garages) and 7-Eleven stores that are rented out by Amazon. Customers can choose to have their package shipped to one of these lockers for pick-up at their convenience. The WSJ reports that Amazon would likely use a similar logistics structure for the rumored On My Way app, letting users pick up and deliver packages from a convenient location to make some extra money. Besides the standard shipping (or two-day for Prime members), Amazon has fiddled with the idea of letting Uber drivers and yellow cabs deliver products same-day, as well as using bike messengers and third-party delivery services for Prime Now and AmazonFresh, both of which function within hours-long (and not days-long) delivery windows. The company has even talked about launching a fleet of drones to deliver parcels, though that flight faces its own delays.\\n\\nSnapchat Turns Geofilters Into An Ad Unit:\\xa0Snapchat may have finally found a way to monetize that its users will actually like. The company is now extending its custom geofilters to businesses as a monetization strategy. On Monday, McDonald’s became the first company to pay Snapchat to run a geofilter advertising campaign. Now, McDonald’s branded geofilters will be available for users to use at any of the over 14,000 McDonald’s stores in the U.S. Added as a feature in 2014, geofilters allow Snapchat users to add a location-specific filter to photos or videos. These filters quickly became a popular way to tell friends where a snapchat was taken, and now over one million snapchats a day are decorated with a geofilter. While users have been able to propose and submit potential geofilters since December, the company says only about one-third of submissions are approved. This new program will allow companies to bypass the user submission process, as well as add geofilters to thousands of locations at once. While geofilters paid for by companies will be denoted with a tiny “Sponsored” imprint, they otherwise will function exactly the same as existing filters.\\n\\nUber is getting serious about maps, and it has poached the former head of Google Maps to lead the charge.:\\xa0Brian McClendon, a Google engineering VP and 10-year company veteran, will be overseeing Uber’s new Pittsburgh center, staffed by engineers recruited from Carnegie Mellon’s National Robotics Engineering Center. Uber has taken several steps recently to strengthen its mapping technology. In March it acquired deCarta, a nearly decade old company that powers the mapping technology behind location-based services like General Motors’ OnStar navigation system. Uber also recently put in a bid for Nokia’s Here mapping technology, going head to head with the likes of a consortium of German automotive companies for the property. Almost everything Uber does relies on geospatial software, from its estimated car arrival times to directions for drivers to its UberPool system for matching travelers who want to share rides. Understandably, the company doesn’t want to rely solely on Google and Apple, as it currently does, for the technology that underlies its system, particularly in a time when Google’s and Uber’s initiatives are starting to overlap. McClendon was one of the rare Googlers to join the search giant via an acquisition and stay for several years. He arrived in 2004 with the purchase of Keyhole, part of a trio of companies Google swept up before the public birth of Maps. Keyhole’s technology became Google Earth. Its co-founder, John Hanke, also stayed at Google, where, in 2010, he was given oversight of the internal incubator Niantic Labs. McClendon was given purview over Google’s “Geo” products, which include Maps, Earth and Street View. He was one of the few execs to lead a product portfolio who was not an SVP or part of the inner circle of CEO Larry Page. Amid Google’s sweeping reorganization last October, McClendon was replaced by Jen Fitzpatrick, another engineering VP, who has been with Google since 1999. His mapping background made him a prime recruitment target for Uber.\\n\\nTwitter Unleashes Autoplay Video Ads With a 100% Viewability Promise: If not completely viewable, brands won\\'t be charged:\\xa0Twitter is ready to serve autoplay video, which has the potential to change up the experience on the platform with richer and more engaging media. The company has taken a hard stand on viewability standards: It is promising only to charge on video ads that have been seen 100 percent in full view of the user. Autoplay video has become a standard format in social media and one that is supported by advertisers, who like the fact that their content makes more of an impact. Here are some of the key numbers Twitter revealed about its tests regarding autoplay video: Users were 2.5 times more likely to prefer autoplay over click-to-view or thumbnail previews on videos. Ad recall was 14 percent greater on autoplay-promoted videos versus other formats. Completion rates were seven times greater on autoplay compared to other formats.\\n\\nGoogle Highlights Cloud Capabilities as GCP Beats AWS, Microsoft to Win HTC as Customer:\\xa0At an event Tuesday for Google Cloud Platform — Google’s name for the computing, storage and networking it sells to business — Google will name the Taiwanese phone maker HTC as a customer. HTC has used Google to build a new kind of computing architecture that enables smartphone apps to update data fast and reliably to many devices at once, and look efficient even when the phones get poor reception. HTC also looked at the cloud offerings of AWS and Microsoft Azure, along with IBM and Alibaba. Google was the dark horse, because it does not operate in China, and HTC wanted to be everywhere in the world. Google’s technical dedication won the day. “The other salesmen just wanted to take orders,” Google is talking more openly about companies that use its cloud business, and revealing more about its computing resources, perhaps the largest on the planet. These include disclosures about Google’s ultrafast fiber network, its big data resources, and the computers and software it has built for itself. The disclosures follow earlier moves by Google Cloud Platform, as the search company’s cloud computing business is called, to show off its data analysis capabilities. The aim is to position Google as a company capable of handling the biggest and toughest computational exercises, lightning fast. Each cloud player is now reflecting the nature of its core business. Amazon, a retailer, is offering computing at scale and ease of use in data analysis. Microsoft, with decades of business ties, stresses its interoperability with current systems and data tools. And IBM has lots of high-level data analysts. Google Cloud Platform has built out specialties in areas like manufacturing, genomics and media to handle industry-specific needs on a global basis.\\n\\nAirbnb Says Chinese Travelers Are Fastest-Growing Users:\\xa0Airbnb is drawing more customers from China, Chief Technology Officer Nathan Blecharczyk said. The firm has built relationships with Chinese consumers when they travel abroad, he said. The group represents Airbnb\\'s fastest growing category, according to Blecharczyk.The San Francisco-based company doubled the number of properties it lists in Cuba to 2,000 within 45 days after debuting in the country, Blecharczyk said. Airbnb, which started in the country after President Barack Obama took steps to open relations with the communist nation, said last month Cuba was its fastest-growing market.\\n\\nAdobe earnings: revenue $1.16 billion, up 9% YoY; shares fall 2%:\\xa0Photoshop maker Adobe reported that total revenue for quarter ending May 29th rose 8.8 percent to $1.16 billion, in line with analysts\\' average estimate. Net income rose to $147.5 million from $88 million in the year-ago quarter. The firm recorded better-than-expected profit for the sixth straight quarter, helped by a 12 percent sequential jump in annualized recurring revenue in its digital media segment. However, the company\\'s shares fell about 2 percent in extended trading after it forecast lower-than-expected revenue and profit for the current quarter. Adobe is switching from traditional box licenses to web-based subscriptions for its Creative Cloud software bundle for more predictable recurring revenue. Online subscriptions let customers access the latest software versions for a monthly payment. The company said it expects revenue in its print and publishing business to be relatively flat in the current quarter with the second. Adobe earlier on Tuesday launched Adobe Stock, a collection of 40 million photographs, illustrations and graphics, available in 36 countries and 13 languages.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere is an audio version of this MP3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCompanies - Including IBM and Cloudera - Are Moving On From Big Data Technology Hadoop:\\xa0There is increasing evidence that Hadoop — one of the most important technologies of the past several years for big data analysis —is not keeping up with the world that created it. On Monday, IBM, which has champion ed Hadoop and put it at the center of its big data strategy, announced it is working on a faster data-processing engine, called Spark. Additionally, a senior executive at Cloudera, probably the largest Hadoop company, said Cloudera is prepared to see key parts of Hadoop diminish in importance, and was increasingly distributing Spark. Hadoop is an open-source architecture that drew heavily on work published by Google in 2004, in particular two different papers on managing, processing and generating very large data sets. Google’s File System and MapReduce, the subjects of the two papers, were based on computing systems that were not organized around drawing a lot of computer memory in a short time; there just hadn’t been that much data before. It did a good job, but it had inherent limitations, since it was adapting one style of computing to another. Spark, by contrast, assumes a world where digital information comes in massive volumes from web browsers, sensors, phones and other things. Does that mean old Hadoop is dead, and with it companies like Cloudera and Hortonworks? Not so fast – they may have been planning for this day. “We’re already the largest distributor of Spark in the world, including Databricks,” said Mike Olson, chief strategy officer at Cloudera. “If MapReduce becomes less important in how people do big data, and it will, we will be there.” Cloudera, he said, has “reset in a smart way, ahead of the others,” by focusing on tools and services for other kinds of analysis besides Hadoop.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook’s new Moments app is meant to take the pain out of sharing pictures:\\xa0Facebook on Monday announced a new mobile photo-sharing app that aims to solve a major modern headache: getting the pictures off of everyone\\'s smartphone. The app uses Facebook\\'s face-tagging technology to identify which friends are in your photos so you can sort through the collection by looking for particular people -- \"Photos of Joe,\" for example. You can use Moments to post pictures to Facebook, Instagram and Facebook Messenger, but albums are set to stay between friends by default. Users also choose to sync certain photos to the app -- as can their friends -- so you won\\'t necessarily have to share every photo you took at a particular event with everyone. The app will be available Monday, for iOS and Android devices. Google Photos, which the company announced earlier this month at its developers conference, goes even further than Facebook and lets you search through your pictures not only for faces but also for things such as \"sunsets\" or \"beaches\" to easily sift through your photo library. Apple revamped its iPhoto earlier this year to add pictures to the cloud. Flickr also updated its service this spring to make it easier to sort, sync and share your snapshots.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChinese Uber Rival Will Raise Funds at $15 Billion Valuation:\\xa0Two recently merged taxi applications backed by Alibaba and Tencent are seeking to raise funds that value the company at $12 billion to $15 billion. The competing Didi and Kuaidi apps combined in February, and form China’s largest taxi and ride-sharing platforms after merging to limit the rising costs of competing with each other and Uber. Didi Kuaidi still runs separate apps that customers use to access their service, while combining their technology and data. Didi Kuaidi, accounts for 78 percent of ride bookings, while Uber has about 11 percent. Alibaba and Tencent own 10 percent and 13 percent, respectively, in the merged company and Tokyo-based SoftBank also has a stake. The new valuation would make Didi Kuaidi one of the most valuable startups in China after smartphone maker Xiaomi, valued at $45 billion. Meanwhile Uber has told investors it plans to invest $1 billion in China.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Growth Equity In Venture Capital:\\xa0According to data by Dealogic, tech sector IPOs are off to their slowest start since 2009, totaling just $2.35 billion as compared to last year’s total of 62 IPOs valued at approximately $40.8 billion. Companies are now delaying their initial public offerings because they’re able to rely on private investors, such as those in the growth-equity sector, to help fund their next round of capital. Private funding is now filling their capital needs faster and making companies more profitable by raising the valuations. In fact, some companies that might have previously gone public in an effort to raise capital are now becoming acquired before ever hitting the public market. The technology industry is booming, and contrary to popular belief, it’s not just early-stage venture funding that’s steering the ship. Helping to propel this rapid expansion is actually another group of investors that specializes in growing established companies and taking them to the next level, aptly named “growth equity.” In the ecosystem of funding options, growth-equity investors tend to strategically focus on companies with proven technologies and established market adoption — many of which are already generating revenues between $5 million and $100 million. In recent years, growth equity has become its own asset class and is actively followed and monitored by investors. Growth equity enjoys the benefits of investing slightly later down the road in the growth of technology companies, thereby reducing the risk of future financing rounds, while at the same time avoiding the seniority of leverage utilized by private equity firms. The risk-adjusted results of this asset class indicate that better returns can be generated with lower associated risk. Additionally, growth-equity investors tend to be much more hands-on and often occupy seats on the boards of their portfolio companies. This helps to control and lessen the risk associated with investing at this stage. In some instances, growth-equity investors help provide liquidity to founding partners who might have been working for years with little to no return. They also offer the necessary guidance to structure growth-oriented deals that require more complex maneuvers, such as funding mergers and acquisitions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an\\xa0audio (MP3) version of this\\xa0snippet, and archived\\xa0snippets\\xa0are\\xa0here.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYouTube Takes On Amazon With New Gaming App:\\xa0Google announced the release this summer of YouTube Gaming, a mobile application and website that will focus on video game videos and live streams. In a blog post, the company said YouTube Games would have individual pages for some 25,000 games as well as pages for particular publishers and gaming celebrities. This arena has become increasingly competitive. There is Twitch, the site where gamers watch each other play live, which Amazon bought for about $1 billion last year. And Twitch is facing competition from sites like MLG.TV, which has poached former Twitch stars like the Call of Duty phenom Matthew “Nadeshot” Haag. YouTube Gaming is the latest example of the website’s efforts to better serve a specific demographic of its customer base, with the goal of encouraging advertisers to spend more money. YouTube has also created an app specifically for kids who watch videos. YouTube is stepping up investments in new services to attract viewers and ad dollars to compete with Amazon, Facebook, Hulu and Spotify. In February, YouTube released YouTube Kids, which can be downloaded onto phones or tablets and includes special parental controls and programs such as Thomas the Tank Engine, Mother Goose Club and Reading Rainbow. It is also testing a stand-alone music service called YouTube Music Key.\\n\\n\\nNielsen Study: The average American used apps for 37.5 hours last quarter -- nearly a full work-week.\\xa0Nielsen on Thursday released a new study showing that while the number of apps that smartphone-wielding Americans use holds steady at around 26.7 per month, we\\'re spending more time with them overall. The average American used apps for 37 hours and 28 minutes last quarter -- nearly a full work-week. And that\\'s up from 30 hours and 15 minutes just the quarter before and a 63 percent rise over two years, the company said in a blog post. Nielsen dug into its data and found that entertainment apps such as games, music and video seem to be the main culprits of the increase. Overall, smartphone users reported a 26 percent increase in the time they spend using their smartphones for the fun things in life, for an average of 13 hours and 20 minutes per month. Entertainment app users gained 13 million additional users over the past year. And, as a group, they spent nearly three hours more in apps than they did last year. Gaming, meanwhile, was the fastest-growing app category within entertainment. More than three-quarters of entertainment app users reported playing at least one game in the last quarter of 2014. Smartphone owners spend a little more than 10 hours playing games, which can get awfully addictive.Men use more apps than women -- 27.2, on average, versus 26.3 -- \\xa0but women tend to spend about an hour more using apps overall each month.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba Plans to Create TBO, China’s Version of Netflix, HBO:\\xa0Alibaba is planning to build China’s version of Netflix and HBO via a new service called Tmall Box Office, as it tries to service 600 million families craving more entertainment content. Tmall Box Office will be offered in about two months through Alibaba\\'s set-top box and smart televisions that carry its operating system, including those manufactured by Haier Group. Some of the content will be produced by the company and some purchased overseas. Alibaba is on a buying spree as it tries to compete with Tencent Holdings for China’s $5.9 billion online video market. Alibaba Pictures Group Ltd. completed a $1.57 billion stake sale in Hong Kong to help finance potential acquisitions in June. Billionaire Chairman Jack Ma visited Hollywood in October to acquire more content. “We want to create a whole new family entertainment experience,” Liu said. “Our goal is to become like Netflix in the U.S, HBO in the U.S.” It was not clear how the service would fit with Youku Tudou, one of China\\'s biggest video streaming platforms in which Alibaba bought a 16.5 percent stake last year. However, unlike the majority of domestic rivals, about 90 percent of TBO\\'s content will be paid for, either by monthly subscription or on a show-by-show basis, Liu said. The remaining 10 percent would be free. Netflix itself is also considering an entry into China, a notoriously difficult task for foreign Internet companies.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nReliance readies for an e-Commerce push - talks of B2B marketplace and mobile payments at AGM.\\xa0Mukesh Ambani said Reliance Retail’s fashion and lifestyle format will roll out its e-commerce property before the end of this year. Reliance Jio, the wireless telephony and data services unit of RIL, is set to launch 4G services by December this year. \\xa0RIL will also use Reliance Jio’s internet infrastructure to roll out an e-commerce marketplace platform, group chairman Ambani said at the company’s 41st annual general meeting on Friday. Here’s a peek at upcoming JIO services: Jio Money – Digital payments and money transfer services including a digital wallet. Switch-and-Walk – an app that allows customers to seamlessly change phones. Jio Drive – a cloud app for storing, sync-ing and sharing content between devices and with friends. Jio Play – An HD TV service with hundreds of channels. \\xa0Jio Beats – a digital music streaming service, that also allows download and offline listening. Jio Mags - a collection of popular magazines. Jio News – news from leading news publishing houses across multiple languages and categories.\\xa0\\nFacebook will tweak your news feed based on how long you look at stuff:\\xa0Facebook is tweaking its algorithms to account for a new metric: the amount of time you spend looking at things in your feed, regardless of whether or not you actively interact with it. Scroll past something without stopping for long, and Facebook’s algorithms will slowly learn that you don’t particularly care for that sort of content. Camp out on a post for a bit, though, and Facebook starts the timer behind the scenes. If you spend more time on this story than you spend on most things in your feed — studying a picture, perusing the comment thread — they’ll take that as a signal that it’s something you care about. Facebook is doing this because it realizes that you probably don’t always like, share or comment on the stuff that pops up in your Facebook feed, even if it’s something you care to see. In other words: those endless baby photos and motivational fitness memes that you tend to scroll right on past? At least theoretically, this change allows Facebook’s algorithms to take the hint without requiring you to lift a finger.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",
      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter\\'s Dick Costolo to step down as CEO in yet another shake-up; Stock rises 3.5%. Twitter Inc Chief Executive Officer Dick Costolo abruptly announced he was stepping down on Thursday amid increasing scrutiny of the company\\'s slow user growth and inability to attract advertisers at the same rate as its competitors. Costolo will be replaced by co-founder Jack Dorsey on an interim basis. According to a source familiar with the matter, it was Costolo\\'s decision to leave, and Costolo said he brought it up with the board last year as it began talking about succession planning. Twitter has had a number of shake-ups in its management. Co-founders Jack Dorsey and Evan Williams both served as CEOs of the company before Costolo, and Costolo has overhauled much of his management team over the past year. \"Unfortunately this news isn\\'t surprising,\" said Nate Elliott of management consultant Forrester Research. \"The bottom line is that Twitter isn\\'t very good right now at serving either its users or its marketers.\" Wall Street reacted positively to the news, as Twitter shares rose to $37.17, up 3.6 percent, after the announcement, meaning investors thought Twitter was worth $900 million more without Costolo than with him.\\n\\n\\nTwitter to Eliminate 140-Character Limit in Direct Messages Twitter Inc., the home of 140-character messages, is removing the space limit in its private messages. The change comes next month, the San Francisco-based company said Thursday on its website for developers. Direct Messages are different from tweets in that they are only visible between individual users. “We’ve done a lot to improve Direct Messages over the past year and have much more exciting work on the horizon,” Sachin Agarwal, Twitter’s product manager for Direct Message, wrote. “You may be wondering what this means for the public side of Twitter. Nothing! Tweets will continue to be the 140 characters they are today.”\\n\\n\\nAmazon’s E-Books Business Investigated by European Antitrust Regulators. European regulators announced an antitrust investigation on Thursday into whether Amazon used its dominant position in the region’s e-books market to favor its own products over those of rivals. The European Commission said it was evaluating the legality of clauses that Amazon had used with European publishers, which required them to inform the e-commerce giant of more favorable terms for books that were offered to other digital retailers. The announcement is the latest hurdle facing United States technology companies in Europe. European policy makers in recent years have pursued a series of tax, antitrust and other investigations into the businesses of Apple, Google and Facebook. The European authorities said the clauses being evaluated in the e-books investigation might have hampered competition by making it more difficult for Amazon’s rivals to offer lower prices. Amazon has been estimated to sell about eight out of every 10 e-books in Britain. In Germany, the percentage is just under half. In the United States, Amazon has an estimated two-thirds of the e-book market. The investigation is at an early stage and still could be dropped or end in a settlement without a formal finding of wrongdoing. If formal charges, known as a Statement of Objections, are eventually brought against Amazon and Amazon fails to successfully rebut those findings, the company could face a fine of as much as 10 percent of its most recent annual global sales.\\nCoding Boot Camp Enrollment Soars as Students Seek Tech Jobs. Graduates of computer coding schools will more than double this year, a signal of heightened interest in high-paid technology jobs. More than 16,000 students will graduate from programming boot camps, up from 6,740 in 2014, according to data from Course Report, a website that allows students to rate the schools. The intensive training programs teach students how to create websites and mobile apps in two to six months and cost as much as $21,000. The tech boot-camp industry is less than four years old and graduated about 2,000 students two years ago, according to Course Report. Graduates don’t receive diplomas or certificates. Their credentials are the software programs that they coded while in school. About three-quarters of students are placed in coding jobs within three months of graduating, Course Report said in August. Mean boot camp tuition is $11,063, about 10 percent higher than a year earlier, and ranges to as much as $21,000, Course Report said in a statement. Total boot camp industry revenue will be about $172 million in 2015, up from about $52 million last year, the statement said.\\n\\n\\nBeset With Failures, Google Tries to Breathe New Life Into Android One - Appoints Caesar Sengupta as New Leader.\\xa0Caesar Sengupta, a VP based in Singapore who once managed Chromebook globally, now oversees Android One. He is close to Sunder Pichai and is admired within the company, largely for his work on Chromebooks. “If there’s anyone at Google who understands the hardware partner ecosystem, it’s Caesar,” said Shailesh Nalawadi, who left Google two years ago to co-found Mavin, a mobile startup focused on reducing Internet access costs in markets like India. “He’s probably the best person to be working on this.” Last September, Google inaugurated Android One, a cheap smartphone line for emerging markets, with typical Google audacity: It was billed as the fix “for the next five billion” soon to come online. The initiative, which promised low-cost devices with the latest version of the Android operating system and Google’s full software imprint, was a point of pride within Google. Started in India, one of Google’s biggest markets and the birthplace of Android chief Sundar Pichai, it was counted among the many bids to spread Internet access globally. Android One began with a bang, thanks to the tremendous marketing dollars Google put behind it. But despite its scale, it has been a disappointment, beset by reluctant consumers and manufacturing partners, as well as misfires from the search company that has never quite cracked hardware, according to multiple people familiar with the project. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an\\xa0audio (MP3) version of this\\xa0snippet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook expands its Buy Button test; ties up with Shopify. With the news that Google and Pinterest are introducing their own Buy buttons, Facebook has a message: We’re still working on our own version, too. The company on Wednesday announced it is working with e-commerce software company Shopify, which helps companies set up digital storefronts, to expand its Buy button test to a larger number of small businesses that already work with Shopify. Since July, Facebook has been testing the Buy buttons with a few hundred small- and mid-sized businesses. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpotify Value Tops $8 Billion as Investors Bet on Streaming: Spotify Ltd. received a valuation topping $8 billion in its latest round of funding as the world’s largest subscription music-streaming service said its number of customers exceeded 75 million. The company raised $526 million from investors including Goldman Sachs, Baillie Gifford, Discovery Capital Management, Lansdowne Partners, Rinkelberg Capital and Senvest Capital for a valuation of $8.5 billion, a person familiar with the matter said. Phone carrier TeliaSonera said Wednesday it invested $115 million. In comparison, Pandora, which runs an ad-supported Web radio, and reported 79.2 million active listeners at the end of the first quarter,  has a market value of $3.6 billion. Spotify continues to amass funds as it tries to boost its subscription service before Apple Inc. gains more customers for its updated music offering, unveiled this week. Both Apple and Spotify give users access to more than 30 million songs, and each service costs $9.99 a month. With music purchases shrinking in stores and online, streaming has emerged as the industry’s primary source of growth. Record labels acknowledge its significance, while complaining streaming has failed to replace lost retail sales. Spotify now has more than 20 million paying subscribers and more than 75 million active users, it said in a statement on its website Wednesday. The company said it has paid more than $3 billion in royalties to artists and record labels since its start over six years ago.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter Advertisers Can Now Target You Based on the Other Apps on Your Phone. For the past six months, Twitter has been collecting data on which smartphone apps its users download. Now, the company is using that data to make some money. Twitter announced on Wednesday that its advertisers can use that app information to target users with ads. Marketers will be able to target you based on the different categories of apps you have downloaded onto your phone as well as how recently you downloaded them. Twitter first announced in November that it was collecting this data, but until now, it wasn’t using it for anything. It’s easy to understand the draw from Twitter’s perspective: If Twitter knows you like Candy Crush, it may assume you like other similar games as well. It’s also easy to understand why this type of targeting may freak some users out. You can block Twitter from collecting this data in settings, but the feature is opt-out, which means the company will gather this information unless you tell it to stop. Twitter won’t, however, have access to information within the apps you download. For example, the company may know you’ve downloaded WhatsApp, but it won’t have access to your messages.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft Launches Giant Smart Whiteboard - Picks Unusual Place to Manufacture it - the U.S.: There is nothing ordinary about Surface Hub, a gargantuan touch-screen computer that Microsoft is about to start selling to companies as a high-tech replacement for conference room whiteboards. People in a meeting can scribble on the screen with a stylus and pan around an image using their hands. Everything on the screen, along with video images of meeting participants, can be shared over the Internet with people in other locations. The largest Surface Hub, measuring 84 inches diagonally, looks like an iPad that has gone through a growth spurt. The 4K resolution of the screen produces dazzling images. At $20,000 apiece, a price Microsoft plans to announce on Wednesday, it should. Just as unusual is where Microsoft is building the Surface Hub: Wilsonville, Oregon, just outside Portland and about 200 miles south of the company’s headquarters in Redmond, Wash. That puts the Surface Hub in a rare category, since most of Microsoft’s better-known devices, like the Xbox game console, are made overseas.In recent years, there has been a surge of optimism about the prospect of high-tech manufacturing jobs returning to the United States after some headline-grabbing moves, like Apple’s decision to build its Mac Pro computer in Texas starting in 2013. But they remain outliers in an industry that has outsourced to Asia the making of everything from game consoles to smartphones. The Surface Hub, though, is an illustration of an exotic tech product that its makers believe can be manufactured cost-effectively in the United States. The product is so unusual — representing one of the largest touch screens of its kind — that Microsoft could not find existing assembly lines in Asia to build it on, the company said. At 220 pounds, the largest Surface Hub is expensive to ship long distances. And its already hefty price means any additional labor costs associated with making it in the United States will be harder for customers to detect.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHackers May Have Obtained Names of Chinese With Ties to U.S. Government. Chinese hackers who attacked the databases of the Office of Personnel Management may have obtained the names of Chinese relatives, friends and frequent associates of American diplomats and other government officials, information that Beijing could use for blackmail or retaliation. Federal employees who handle national security information are required to list some or all of their foreign contacts, depending on the agency, to receive high-level clearances. Investigators say that the hackers obtained many of the lists, and they are trying to determine how many of those thousands of names were compromised. “They are pumping this through their databases just as the N.S.A. pumps telephone data through their databases,” said James Lewis, a cyberexpert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “It gives the Chinese the ability to exploit who is listed as a foreign contact. And if you are a Chinese person who didn’t report your contacts or relationships with an American, you may have a problem.” Officials have conceded in the briefings that most of the compromised data was not encrypted, though they have argued that the attacks were so sophisticated and well hidden that encryption might have done little good.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBox Spikes 9% On Strong FQ1 Revenue Growth, Narrowing Losses. Cloud storage provider Box raised its full-year forecast as more customers subscribed to its content-sharing platform. Box raised its full-year forecast to $286 million-$290 million from $281 million-$285 million earlier. Shares of the company, whose customers include AstraZeneca, General Electric and Chevron , rose about 8.7 percent in extended trading on Wednesday. The company said it surpassed 37 million registered users, compared with 34 million at the end of the fourth quarter. The number of paying users grew 70 percent from a year earlier, and now accounts for more than 10 percent of total users, the company said. The online file-sharing and personal cloud content management service for businesses leverages a \"freemium\" business model, providing up to 10 GB of free storage for personal accounts and charging for additional space. In April, Box launched its premium security service, which lets businesses control their encryption keys, the encoding tools used to keep data safe. The company\\'s main competitors include privately held Dropbox, Microsoft\\'s OneDrive, Citrix Systems ShareFile and Google\\'s  Drive.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an\\xa0audio (MP3) version of this\\xa0snippet\\n\\n\\nAsia is driving Facebook\\'s growth - Facebook now earns 51 percent of ad revenue overseas - Asia revenue growing 57% Y/Y; by contrast Europe lags the US. For the first time, Facebook  has detailed ad sales outside the United States and Canada as a percent of worldwide sales. Overseas markets bring in more advertising revenue than the United States for Facebook, amounting to 51 percent of global ad sales in the first quarter. Growth in Asia was the fastest at 57 percent. While Europe is growing slower than the United States, the Asia Pacific region is ahead and a focus for Facebook. By comparison, Google said that 57 percent of its revenue was from international markets in the first quarter, although it did not break out ad revenue specifically. Mobile advertising represents more than 70 percent of Facebook\\'s total ad revenue, and mobile is particularly strong and attractive to advertisers in emerging markets. Facebook is benefiting from exporters in China trying to reach people outside its country and from an influx of venture capital funding into India, giving start-ups funds for advertising. Total advertising revenue for the quarter increased 46 percent to $3.3 billion, the vast majority of Facebook\\'s $3.5 billion in quarterly revenue. International advertising revenue rose 36 percent from a year earlier, Facebook said.\\n\\n\\nGoogle Talent Departs for Unicorn Herd: Cloudera taps Google VP as Engineering Head, DropBox poaches Neal Mohan for top job: Cloud analytics software company Cloudera said today it has named Daniel Sturman as its VP of engineering. Sturman previously spent eight years at Google, where as VP of engineering he was in charge of keeping its computing infrastructure for services like Google Compute Engine and Google App Engine. Neal Mohan, Google’s VP for display and video advertising, is leaving for the top product job at Dropbox. He is part of a wave of execs departing the search engine in recent months for fast-growing, pre-IPO startups. More recently, Uber claimed Tom Fallows, who had led Google’s same-day delivery service, in November, followed by communication and policy chief Rachel Whetstone. Jawbone nabbed Fallows’s boss, Sameer Samat. Indian e-commerce unicorn Flipkart snatched two Googlers: The VP of product at Motorola and the person who ran the low-cost handset Android One project. On the smaller startup side, the ads product head at YouTube recently headed to Luxe, an on-demand parking startup. There’s more, but you get the idea. Google downplays exits, citing them as regular industry churn. But they come as Google’s core business faces rising threats and fears that it has grown too large and too uninspired to retain ambitious top tech talent. Apparently, the Google bench is not as rewarding for some as the thrill of a unicorn ride.\\n\\n\\nTinder Goes Through A Small Round Of Layoffs; spring-cleaning, not restructuring, company says. Tinder — one of the most popular dating apps currently available across the globe — laid off around 10 percent of its staff last week. TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that the company laid off six members of the 60-65 member team, including three marketing employees and three engineers. TechCrunch was told this wasn’t part of a re-structuring, or even a result of leadership changes with new CEO Chris Payne and VP of Engineering Hugh Williams, but rather a spring-cleaning of sorts. Tinder has gone through much larger transitions before, including a lawsuit waged by former VP of Marketing Whitney Wolfe, the resignation of CMO Justin Mateen, and the transition of Sean Rad from CEO to President. Since then, Chris Payne has joined the team as CEO and Hugh Williams has taken over the engineering squad. The first year of monetization can be tricky for any social startup, and with the complexities of Tinder Plus — ads, premium features, oddball pricing, etc. — it would make sense to double-check that the team is as lean as possible.\\nTesla CFO retires; Firm Will Start Delivering Model X SUV in 3 to 4 Months, Says Elon Musk;  Tesla Motors  will begin deliveries of the Model X sport utility vehicle in three to four months, keeping close to the timeline the electric-car maker laid out earlier this year, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said. “The Model X will be a better SUV than the Model S is a sedan,” Musk, 43, said Tuesday at Tesla’s annual shareholders meeting, held at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. Musk said he’s been driving the latest prototype of the Model X, which Tesla first unveiled as a concept in February 2012 and previously sought to have ready by the end of 2014. More recently, Tesla told investors that initial deliveries to customers, several of whom have been waiting for more than three years, would begin late in the third quarter. Car-based SUVs are popular among female drivers, and in a January interview with Bloomberg, Musk said that the Model X is drawing more than half its orders from women. This is a contrast from the predominantly male customer base for its Model S sedan and the Roadster, which the Palo Alto, California-based company no longer sells. Tesla is also working on the Model 3, to be released in 2017 with a starting price of roughly $35,000. In addition, the company is readying another software upgrade for the Model S, including so-called autopilot driver-assist technology, and “may be able to get it out to early-access customers by the end of this month,” Musk said. Musk has said the company probably won’t turn net income positive until annual sales reach 500,000. “I expect we’ll achieve profitability in 2020,” he said. Musk is by far Tesla’s largest shareholder with 22 percent. He said in February that at the rate it’s growing, if all goes right, Tesla in a decade could be worth as much as Apple Inc., the world’s largest company by market valuation, is now. Musk also said CFO Deepak Ahuja will retire at the end of this year. Ahuja has been Tesla’s CFO since 2008, coming from Ford Motor and seeing Tesla through its June 2010 initial public offering. He said he’s retiring to pursue other life goals.\\nGeek shortage stymies Israel\\'s Tech Boom as Soviet emigre engineers retire, fewer youth study advanced science. Israel\\'s technology miracle is threatened by a dearth of people in the very professions that made it happen: engineers and computer scientists. Companies say finding qualified workers is one of their biggest problems. And the shortage may worsen as fewer students sign up for the most advanced math classes, the building block for tech careers. This in an economy whose health depends on exports—about one-third of them from technology companies. One explanation for the shortage: Engineers who emigrated from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s are retiring. \"We don\\'t truly appreciate that immigration,\\'\\' says Adam Fisher, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. \"Without that I\\'m not sure we would be \\'Start-Up Nation\\'.Meanwhile, fewer of Israel\\'s youth are choosing to study advanced math, and there\\'s no increase in those studying advanced science, in part put off by the level of difficulty that could bring down overall grades. The number of high school students matriculating in advanced math dropped by a quarter from 2006, to 9,350 in 2014, according to the Trump Foundation, dedicated to improving education in Israel. Almost a year ago, a ministerial committee drew up a program to increase skilled manpower for the industry. Its plan includes recruiting more Israeli Arabs into the industry, training ultra-Orthodox men and women, luring Israeli engineers abroad to return home, and making it easier for non-Israelis to get work visas. It must be approved by the new cabinet and could be passed later this year. Some parts are in place: About 300 academics were persuaded to return to Israel last year out of 4,300 who registered as willing to do so.\\nIBM plans Data Analytics push - bets on Spark, open-source software project that aims to be Hadoop successor.IBM has created a Technology Center in San Francisco to focus on a free open-source software project called Spark, according to IBM executive Rob Thomas. IBM hired 20 people within the last month, Thomas said in a video posted online June 3. “We’re going to be scaling this up to hundreds of people that are just focused on Spark open source and how we evolve that for the enterprise,” Thomas said. Spark is a framework developed originally at the University of California at Berkeley that helps companies process large amounts of data rapidly, by storing information within the fast memory of computers. It is seen by many in Silicon Valley as a potential successor to Hadoop, which has spawned a variety of companies including Cloudera, MapR Technologies and Hortonworks. “This is a much more significant bet than even what we have done on Hadoop to be frank,” Thomas said. “We think Spark is going to be enormous and change the face of enterprise IT.”\\nMicrosoft drops the price of the Xbox One and introduces a 1TB console; will sell $25 adapter that allows streaming games from console to PC. Microsoft announced Tuesday that it\\'s dropping the price of the 500 gigabite Xbox One to $349, which had previously been advertised as a \"promotional\" price drop from $399. Now, Microsoft will offer a new 1 terabyte model -- that\\'s double the storage of the old standard model -- for $399 instead, the company said in a blog post. The Xbox is still locked in a battle with Sony\\'s PlayStation to control the console world, and this is a clear play to appeal to hardcore gamers. As gaming guide Kotaku and others have reported, Sony is, in fact, expected to release a 1 TB version of the PlayStation soon. Microsoft also had some more news on its growing efforts to mix Xbox and PC gaming; a major feature of its upcoming operating system is that users can stream games from their console to their computer. To that end, Microsoft also announced it will sell a $25 adapter that will allow players to use their wireless controllers with their current computers. The company has redesigned the controller to allow players to plug their gaming headsets into the controller, which gives them the option to control settings such as the volume of their microphone or the game\\'s audio while they play. Microsoft has also improved the quality of the sound that comes through the controller. The new controller doesn\\'t mean, however, that you have to buy all new headsets or other accessories. \"All existing controller accessories will work with the updated controller,\" the company said.\\nChina\\'s big biotech bet starting to pay off as country\\'s patent portfolio burgeons. Years of pouring money into its laboratories, wooing scientists home from overseas and urging researchers to publish and patent is starting to give China a competitive edge in biotechnology, a strategic field it sees as ripe for \"indigenous innovation.\" The vast resources China can throw at research and development - overall funding more than quadrupled to $191 billion in 2005-13 and the Thousand Talents Program has repatriated scientists - allow China to jump quickly on promising new technologies, often first developed elsewhere. These efforts were illustrated vividly in April - not without controversy - when scientists at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou published results of a ground-breaking experiment to alter the DNA of human embryos using new gene editing technology. Data compiled by Thomson Innovation, a Thomson Reuters unit, shows China is a growing force in gene editing, with a burgeoning patent portfolio. More than 50 Chinese institutions are patenting in the field, led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, universities, the Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Beijing Jifulin Biotech. Nearly a fifth of the 518 families of gene editing patents analyzed since 2004 were associated with Chinese entities.

Fat with almost $6 billion in venture capital, Uber, based in San Francisco, is doling out bonuses up to three times the amount of its fares, in a bet that its exceptional rise in the United States can be matched in China. So far, its strategy is working, shattering prevailing assumptions that young American tech companies cannot compete against local rivals. In late May, Uber said it had created more than 60,000 jobs in China over the past month, with the spread of its service spurring protests from some taxi drivers. While China represents huge scale as a market, it has fended off the entry of just about every major Western technology start-up. Uber, a five-year-old company that operates in more than 310 cities and 58 countries worldwide, faces homegrown Chinese rivals like Didi Kuaidi, which has more than 90 percent of the market and is backed by two of the largest Chinese Internet companies, Alibaba and Tencent. It may also have to grapple with a fickle central government that could shut it out of the market overnight. Yet more affluent and cosmopolitan Chinese have flocked to Uber’s service, attracted by fares that are on average at least 35 percent cheaper than taxis, with the cars generally more luxurious than cabs and drivers who offer free water and are typically more polite. Uber is providing more than 100,000 rides a day in China, according to two people with knowledge of the company’s internal metrics, who declined to be identified because the numbers are confidential. That is about 10 percent of the total one million rides a day that Uber said it was getting companywide in December.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSquare Unveils Mobile Wallet-Friendly Credit Card Reader; Will Give Away 250,000 Devices To Drive Adoption. Square, the San Francisco-based payments processing start-up, unveiled a new credit card reader on Monday, one capable of accepting mobile payments like those made through Apple Pay and Android Pay, among other methods. The new reader, which Square said will be widely available this fall, operates wirelessly for merchants who want to accept contact-less mobile payments. It also accepts so-called EMV enabled Credit Cards, a technology that includes a chip built into credit cards for added security. Square said the new reader will cost $49. The company is giving away about a quarter of a million of the new devices to encourage adoption by small and medium-sized businesses. For Square, the timing of the release is crucial. Credit card processors and merchants across the greater retail industry are up against a deadline later this year, when merchants must switch over to accepting EMV-based credit cards. If they fail to do so, the merchants will become liable for any potential credit card fraud on the transactions they process. But to prepare for EMV — which stands for EuroPay, MasterCard and Visa, the major credit networks that created the new standard — merchants must update their payments acceptance terminals, a process that for some may prove costly. That is where companies like Square — along with rivals like First Data‘s Clover, Poynt and Shopify — are inserting themselves. To capitalize on the EMV shift, these companies are offering their next-generation payment-acceptance terminals to small and medium-sized businesses that are required to switch to updated technology in any case. Many larger retailers are already rebuilding their own in-house payments infrastructures to accept EMV transactions and, in many cases, mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Android Pay. But options like Square’s reader, as well as those like Clover and Poynt, cater to small businesses that need only buy an off-the-shelf hardware terminal to become EMV compliant. In the long run, that’s good for companies like Apple and Google. The more EMV readers small merchants buy, the more places those companies’ mobile wallets will be accepted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba’s Jack Ma Visits U.S. to Lure Businesses Into China As Domestic Growth Sputters. Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma will visit New York and Chicago this week, seeking to pitch China’s middle class as a growth opportunity for American business and his e-commerce company. Ma is looking for revenue beyond China, where the nation’s economy is projected to grow at its slowest pace since 1990. One strategy is to position Alibaba as a cross-border e-commerce solution, enabling China’s 557 million Internet users to buy things from anywhere in the world. Alibabas chairman is scheduled to arrive Monday in New York City and plans a dinner with leaders of select global brands, the company said. His calendar on Tuesday includes lunch with members of the Economic Club of New York at the Waldorf-Astoria New York. Already, Costco and Macy’s Inc. are among U.S. companies reaching Chinese shoppers through Alibaba. Ma has set a goal of raising the company’s revenue from outside China to 50 percent from the current 4 percent. Cross-border sales into China and sales through Alibaba platforms to consumers outside China would constitute international revenue. Shares of Alibaba fell 2.7 percent to $88.29 in New York on Monday, extending this year’s decline to 15 percent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the 11th annual Internet Retailer Conference and Exhibition in Chicago: Doing E-Commerce While Avoiding Amazon. US e-commerce is showing the first signs of maturing as a business. Figures from the research firm eMarketer show the rate of domestic growth falling from 16.5 percent in 2013 to 14.2 percent this year to 11.6 percent in 2018. By that point, e-commerce in the United States will still be less than 10 percent of all retail. The death of the physical store, so widely anticipated in the last few years, is nowhere in sight. One increasingly popular technique: allowing the customer to name his price. Members of PriceWaiter were doling out snacks and explaining how letting customers of a website decide how much they are willing to pay (within, to be sure, a narrow range) works out for both parties. “The merchants win by keeping the sale, and the customer gets a psychological victory — it feels like a win,” Another customer retention method, this one somewhat more fraught with peril: Put reviews on your site. This, of course, is an attempt to take away or at least neutralize one of the features that drove Amazon’s initial success. “Reviews instill trust in your brand and keep the customer coming back,” said Alex Rosen of PowerReviews, a back-end platform to making reviewing easier. He added that brands like to know, must know, when they are getting bad reviews. But strong indeed is the brand that will keep bad reviews on its own site. If many of the exhibitors at IRCE were trying to avoid Amazon, a few were taking it on directly. Justin Singletary said he spent $500,000 a few years ago to buy the Fulfillment.com web domain from eBay. “We saw a void in the marketplace — an opening to take care of the merchants themselves rather than the merchant’s customers,” he said. Asked who the merchants were, he demurred, saying they operated under nondisclosure agreements.With about 60 employees and one domestic warehouse, Fulfillment.com is still an early-stage start-up. Newegg, founded way back in 2001, is by comparison practically an institution. It says it is the second-largest online retailer in North America, with 28 million registered customers, about a tenth of Amazon’s. “Amazon wants to do everything,” said a spokeswoman, Claire Lin. “We want to be really good at one thing: selling tech products.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSEO for Images: Amazon, eBay and Google Shopping policies on Images. Amazon Suppresses Listings Without Images. The online world is becoming more and more image-centric. For retailers, images are an essential way to stand out from the crowd and attract shoppers across online channels. Good pictures are now a prerequisite on many marketplaces, and failing to comply with image requirements could lead to a drop in visibility or even suppressed listings. Amazon requires you to include an image with your listing, otherwise the listing will be suppressed from search and browse bars (which would make it very difficult to find). Shoppers would have to search using the product’s actual code rather than via search terms or browse nodes. To meet Amazon’s image requirements, your products must appear as close to reality as possible, meaning no props or accessories that don’t come with the product. Text, inset images, watermarks and logos are all no-go’s, too. Items must be pictured on a white background, with the product taking up most of the background space (ideally 85%). Pictures must be at least 500 pixels on one side to enable users to zoom in. We suggest going a step further and making your images at least 1600 pixels on the longest side for optimum quality. If you need help creating images with white backgrounds, try apps like Remove the Background.EBay Requires You to Have at Least One Image Per Listing. EBay requires images to be at least 500 pixels on the longest side (again, 1600 is better). Like Amazon, eBay asks for clean images without any text or artwork. Unlike Amazon, however, eBay does allow you to add watermarks, but only for distribution – not marketing – purposes. Watermarks should be no bigger than 5% of the total image area, have an opacity of no more than 50% and never obscure the item. Links from watermarks are also prohibited. You can no longer use stock images for your listings so as not to confuse buyers about the quality of the items. You can use eBay picture hosting to optimize your listing for mobile buyers. With eBay picture hosting, you can include up to 12 pictures in your listing, which will be visible on a variety of mobile platforms. EBay picture hosting can handle images of up to 7MB. Just remember not to compress your images before uploading. Google Shopping adverts rely heavily on product images, so making your photos great is essential for differentiating your items from the competition. Take images on a white, grey or light-color background and use images that are a minimum of 800 pixels so they look clear on high-resolution displays.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an\\xa0audio (MP3) version of this\\xa0snippet.\\n\\n\\nWarning: Some Unicorns May Be Smaller Than They Appear.Protections for Late Investors Can Inflate Start-Up Valuations.\\xa0The recent proliferation of so-called unicorns — start-up technology companies valued at more than $1 billion — has been greeted variously as a sign of healthy innovation or an indication that valuations have become dangerously overheated. Led by the likes of the car-hailing service Uber at $41 billion and the home-rental website Airbnb at $10 billion, the global ranks of unicorns have more than doubled, to 102, over the last 15 months, according to PitchBook Data, which tracks private financial markets. Less noticed is that the reported valuations of many unicorns have been inflated by the terms of the private investments that set those valuations before any initial public offerings of stock — often with little or no disclosure of those terms. Increasingly, venture investors say, late-stage financing terms include extra protections, like a discount to the price of any eventual initial offering, a minimum return on investment or extra shares if the company later raises money at a lower valuation. Such protections are controversial among start-up investors. Early-stage investors warn they can jeopardize a company’s financial stability, diluting the value of their original stakes and worsening a company’s prospects in a downturn. But the protections appeal to company founders because they provide new cash at the highest nominal valuation, reducing dilution if all goes well. And later-stage investors argue that they provide valuable insurance. The protections, known among investors as structuring or ratcheting, can inflate a unicorn’s indicated valuation 10 percent to 25 percent and the phenomenon has been part of a general “frothiness” in late-stage valuations. Since the start of 2014, 11 technology companies have priced their initial offerings below the investment price of the last financing rounds before the offerings. In addition to Box, they include the software providers Apigee and Globant and the big-data manager Hortonworks. In addition, it was estimated that that more than two-fifths of venture-backed technology companies had fallen below their initial offering price in the same period.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nManaging Developers: Just Because You’re In Charge Doesn’t Mean You’re In Control.\\xa0The great irony of management is that the higher up you go, the less actual control you have. When you are but a humble coder, you make the computer do exactly what you want; when you’re a manager, you only hope that people understand what you want, and then trust/pray that they do it both correctly and in a timely manner. The Shit Work Is Your Work. Basically a manager’s job is to make other people more productive. What’s one really good way to do that? Do the work that is getting in their way. Which means: find out what kind of important work your developers dislike the most, and do it for them. Don\\'t BS. Unfortunately, as you probably already know, people suck. People flake, screw up, ignore you, pester you, disappear, quit, and/or lose faith in you, frequently for no good reason. But you know how people — surprisingly — often don’t suck? Not to get all wifty and woo on you, but this was the most surprising lesson of my professional career: once people learn that they can trust you, then you can usually trust them back. So don’t bullshit anyone, ever.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRemittances at the Click of a Smartphone Button are disrupting traditional players like Western Union:\\xa0A growing shift is taking place in how people send money to each other around the world. While the likes of Western Union have offered international money transfers for decades, new tech start-ups and traditional telecom operators are taking advantage of the rapid rise of smartphones in many emerging economies to reduce the barriers — and costs — of sending cash overseas. Analysts say the changes are shaking up the global remittance market, which will be valued at almost $600 billion this year, according to the World Bank. New technology, for example, has helped cut the price of sending traditional remittances in half, to an average of $4 for sending $100, according to the GSMA, a telecom trade body. Sending money can take just a few minutes. Individuals log into the companies’ online services either through a computer or — increasingly — a smartphone. They enter the recipients’ details and their own bank details, and submit the request. Transactions typically take less than a few hours, compared with several days for traditional remittance companies. Recipients receive a text message when the money is available for pickup or has been credited to their mobile money account. Because the operations are automated and don’t rely on outdated systems, operators can offer international remittances at cheaper rates. To send the money, people only need to type in another person’s cellphone number into their phone’s mobile money service, enter a password and confirm the transaction. These sort of mobile payments have not caught on in many Western countries. But mobile money is now a fixture across large parts of the developing world. With limited access to traditional bank accounts, people have often turned to services like M-Pesa — a mobile money offering from Vodafone, the European telecom giant — as the de facto method to pay for goods and send money to friends and family.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProperty listing site 99acres sees sharply declining growth, increasing losses.\\xa0Property listing site 99acres hits Rs 100Cr revenue mark, sinks deeper into losses in FY15. Net revenue growth, which has been sliding slowly over the previous three years but remained around the 50 per cent mark, saw a sharp deceleration to 32 per cent last year. It hit a milestone of crossing Rs 100 crore in net sales, though. The firm\\'s operating EBITDA loss increased almost eight fold over last year. While losses are not unusual in a fast growing internet segment, 99acres was generating marginal profits till FY12. 99acres competes with MagicBricks, IndiaProperty, Housing, CommonFloor and PropTiger among others. \\xa0Meanwhile, 99acres’ growth in paid listings on its site mirrored the performance on its net sales (the company also generates revenue from other channels). It lost one-third of growth momentum last year with paid listings rising 19.2 per cent to 2.46 million against a growth rate of 30 per cent the previous year and a still faster rise in the years before that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHTC Drops to Decade Low After Cutting Quarterly Sales Forecast.\\xa0HTC Corporation fell to the lowest in a decade in Taipei after the smartphone maker cut its sales forecast as much as 35 percent and announced plans to write off $94 million of impaired assets. Shares fell by 9.9 percent, the daily limit, to the lowest since May 2005. Slower demand for high-end smartphones and weaker sales in China prompted the Taiwanese company to forecast second-quarter revenue of as low as NT$ 33 billion, compared with an April 28 forecast for NT$46 billion to NT$51 billion. The lower sales and writedown mean HTC will post a loss for the current quarter, it said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple is set to introduce Apple Pay in Britain, The Telegraph reports.\\xa0Apple is planning to introduce its mobile payment system, Apple Pay, to Britain this summer, The Telegraph reported on Saturday, citing industry sources. Apple is expected to make the announcement on Monday in San Francisco at its annual conference for developers, the paper said. The Telegraph said the iPhone already contains a wireless microchip similar to those found in contactless payment cards, which will allow Apple Pay users to pay by waving the handset over a terminal to pay. Transport for London, the paper said, was already accepting Apple Pay from American tourists.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe confessions of a reformed technology evangelist - He was sure technology would save the world. Then he went to India.\\xa0For a long time Kentaro Toyama was a believer in technological utopianism. He studied physics at Harvard and earned a PhD in computer science at Yale. Toyama went on to do research at Microsoft. The work was demanding, but something was missing. In 2004, when his boss asked if he was interested in opening a research center in India, Toyama accepted on the spot. He’d never even been to India. But he was hungry to make more of a direct contribution to society. Here was the chance to sprinkle tech fairy dust on a developing nation and watch success after success. Except it didn’t play out like that. The humans mattered a lot more than the technology, he found. Toyama settled on a new view of technology. It’s an amplifier of human intentions, not a cure-all for human problems. For technology to be a part of positive change, the environment it enters must already be moving in the right direction. Toyama believes it’s foolish to think education is about having content available to study. “The fundamental problem of education is not content, it’s motivation. You have to find a way to help productively direct the motivation of the student,” Toyama said. “The idea that they can do this just because we have fed it to them online possibly through some fancy interactive graphic I think is just a crazy notion.” He notes how Thomas Edison thought the motion picture would revolutionize our education system. “Television was supposed to uplift millions,” Toyama writes. “Instead, millions sit in thrall to the Kardashians.”\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an\\xa0audio (MP3) version of this\\xa0snippet on SoundCloud\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Apple Watch will hit retail stores on June 26: Apple said it would start selling some models of its watch at its retail stores this month, and also roll out the gadget in seven more countries. The watch has been on display in Apple stores around the world since April 10, when it became available for preorder online and at shops including trendy fashion boutiques in Paris, London and Tokyo. Apple had directed people to order online, preventing long queues around its stores that have become a norm with the company\\'s rollout of new products. Apple Watch will be launched in Italy, Mexico, Spain, South Korea, Singapore, Switzerland and Taiwan on June 26, the company said. The watch is currently available in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the UK. Apart from online stores, customers in these countries can also buy the devices at Apple\\'s retail stores and some authorized resellers. The company has not given any sales figures for the watch since it began taking orders, but has often said demand was outstripping supply. \"The response to Apple Watch has surpassed our expectations in every way,\" said Jeff Williams, senior vice president of operations. \"We\\'re also making great progress with the backlog of Apple Watch orders.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon\\'s e-gifting offering launched quietly recently: Amazon Allowance, which recently debuted without much fanfare, lets people set up monthly or weekly payments to credit their kids\\'  — or anyone else\\'s — Amazon account with a cash balance, like a gift card. That saves parents from having to find cash, write a check or a make a bank transfer, and gives the recipient a way to shop on the website without a credit or debit card. The initiative is significant in a few ways. The e-giving (electronic gift card) market is projected to reach $14 billion in 2017, up from $6 billion last year, according to CEB, and U.S. retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp. and JC Penney Co. have all made e-gifting a part of their strategy. It\\'s also a way to get younger shoppers accustomed to buying things on Amazon. And with Apple Inc. and Google Inc. aiming to turn smartphones into digital wallets, Amazon needs to keep shoppers close. Amazon account holders will be able able to set up one-time and recurring allowances for \"family, friends, or employees that are age 13 and above,\" according to the website. The recipient must have an Amazon account (a parent or guardian will have to help set up an account for those under 17). People can also set up allowances for themselves to budget or save up for a purchase. \"Sending money to family or friends can be a frustrating process,\" said Manish Bansal, general manager of gift certificates at Seattle-based Amazon. \"A lot of early customers are using Amazon Allowances as a way to budget —whether through one-time or recurring allowances. We’re also seeing parents using Amazon Allowances to send money to college kids who need help buying textbooks and dorm essentials.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSnapdeal, GoJavas to pick up return orders in 90 minutes: E-commerce marketplace Snapdeal, and QuickDel Logistics, which operates under the GoJavas brand, have launched a new service that will ensure pick up of return or replacement e-commerce orders within 90 minutes of intimation. The new service, christened ‘go-90′, has gone live in 15 cities, as per a press statement. GoJavas was previously a part of Jabong, a lifestyle e-tailer incubated by Rocket Internet. The move is seen as another step towards stimulating online shopping in the country since returns are seen as a major challenge. Reportedly, around 5-9 per cent of all e-commerce orders end up being returned in India.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook Launches Facebook Lite - A Stripped Down Android App For The Developing World: Today, Facebook is launching a bare-bones, low-resolution version of its Android app that works well on crummy networks or outdated phones, and burns much less data than its normal smartphone apps. It will roll out today in Asia, and come to parts of Latin America, Africa, and Europe in the coming weeks. Facebook Lite is designed specifically for the developing world to help the social network on-board its next billion users. Facebook Lite doesn’t offer data-intensive features like videos or Nearby Friends. But if users are willing to accept that and lower-resolution image thumbnails, they can access Facebook quick, smooth, and cheap from the most remote corners of the planet. Roughly a year back, that’s when we realized that our current Facebook experiences needed a lot more work, specifically in emerging markets and more specifically where networks are bad” Facebook Lite’s product manager Vijay Shankar tells me. So Facebook set out on two parallel paths. First, it would try optimize its flagship apps to load faster with less data. It’s already shrunk down its main Android app. Second, Shankar tells me “We floated another idea. What if we were building this from scratch for emerging markets? How do we completely re-architect this?” Rather than imagine what the problems in these areas were, Shankar says “we did a lot of research on the ground and spent a lot of time in Africa, and India and Indonesia.” The team discovered the solution would need three things: One, to work on any Android phone, regardless of storage space, RAM, and CPU. Two, to load fast even on 2G mobile connections, which is what 4 billion people on earth are stuck with. Three, to use as little data as possible, as the prohibitive cost of data plans is actually the largest barrier to Internet usage, not network access. The main way Facebook makes the app use less data is by never pre-loading full-resolution images. Photos and link preview thumbnails in the News Feed appear a bit grainy at first. They’ll load in full-res if tapped, but Facebook only wants to do those big data pulls if people volunteer for them. If you try to post a photo to Facebook Lite, the app compresses the image and then sends it in the background, so its small and you don’t have to spend the wait time staring at the screen. “Every roundtrip to the server is painful” Shankar says, so “we’re very careful about what features and experiences we offer in the app.” There will be some ads, but several of Facebook’s top formats like app install ads won’t be in Facebook Lite. Advertisers might not love the idea of their creative assets being compressed into low-res. But otherwise, users would probably scroll past them before they even load. Today, Facebook Lite begins its official global rollout. At under 1 megabyte in size, Shankar says it can be downloaded in seconds for cheap on even slow 2G connections. I played with it for a few minutes, and was surprised by how slick and full-featured it was despite the compromises.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCoke\\'s New Twitter Ads Call Out Viewers by Name As Social Promos Get Personal. Coca-Cola has been buying Promoted Tweets that show up in viewers\\' Twitter feeds and address them by their first names. The ad copy starts with: \"Hey [NAME], #ShareACoke is back! Order...\" You can see the full promo in the above image. The new tactic is part of a larger, ongoing \"Share a Coke\" campaign that debuted earlier this spring. The company is encouraging people to buy 8-ounce bottles of the soda, personalized with their names, for $5 apiece. Coke wasn\\'t available for comment. But it appears the Atlanta-based soda giant is employing Twitter\\'s Tailored Audiences platform in an innovative way to create this targeted style of advertising. Twitter deferred to Coca-Cola about the campaign and didn\\'t state whether other brands were using the personalized call to action. But it would certainly interest any marketer that is looking to increase its click-through rates on the microblogging platform.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba has tied up with China\\'s largest loan restructurer to sell bad debt online. Alibaba will cooperate with the biggest state-owned loan restructurer to dispose of more than 4 billion yuan ($645 million) of non-performing assets on its online shopping platform Taobao. China Cinda Asset Management, which announced the tieup with Ma last week, saw profits rise 32 percent to a record in 2014. China’s non-performing loans climbed by an unprecedented 140 billion yuan in the first quarter to 982.5 billion yuan, the most since 2008 and almost the size of Vietnam’s economy. UBS and Standard Chartered are among companies that bought stakes in Cinda before its 2013 public share sale as a stepping stone into the distressed asset market. Cinda’s market value of $23 billion is now larger than KKR’s $19.1 billion. Cinda already sold two bad loans on Alibaba’s retail site Taobao in April for a combined 24.5 million yuan, according to a China Banking Regulatory Commission statement at the time. Four more were auctioned last month for 31.4 million yuan. One of the soured loans auctioned in May was originally from Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. with a clothing company in the eastern Zhejiang province as the debtor. Cinda disclosed details such as the name of the borrower, the principal amount, accrued interest and guarantors of the loan on Taobao. Bidders were advised to look at the loan documents and check the collaterals before auction. Both individuals as well as institutions were allowed to bid. “Alibaba’s online loan auction platform broadens the investor base for bad loans and therefore will lead to better price discovery for distressed assets,” said Liao Qiang, a banking analyst at Standard & Poor’s in Beijing. The legal complexities involved in unwinding such debts and the need to divulge information publicly may limit growth in online auctions, according to KPMG’s Gleave. “Alibaba’s auction site is just a market place,” he said. “Whether that’s a good way to trade bad debts is still to be seen.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYahoo Says Shutting Down Maps Service Site, Other Tools: Maps.yahoo.com will close at the end of June, Amotz Maimon, chief architect at the Sunnyvale, California-based company, said in a blog post. Yahoo will still support mapping as part of other services including search and the photo-sharing website Flickr. Yahoo also is paring back or ending support for other sites and services, including mail support for older versions of Apple Inc.’s iPhone operating system. The company is shuttering market-specific media properties, including Yahoo Music in France and Canada and the home page for the Philippines. In addition, it will end support for creation of Pipes, a Web-content gathering tool. Yahoo Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer is looking for ways to keep costs under control as she works to turn around the company she has led for almost three years. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook Messenger Ditches Constant Mapping To Lay Groundwork For More Location Features. Facebook is removing the confusing, slightly creepy always-on location sharing feature in Messenger for a more explicit, one-time way to share where you are or will be. Location will no longer be a “second class citizen”, Messenger Head Of Product Stan Chudnovsky tells me. Instead, Messenger has big plans for GPS features, saying “What we’re launching is the foundation of everything that’s coming.” For example, “You might want to make reservations. How are we all getting there? Maybe there’s a transportation service somehow” Chudnovsky hints. When I ask if Messenger might build on Uber’s API to let you instantly book rides, he coyly replied “I didn’t say that, but that doesn’t mean I don’t like what you’re saying.” The new design for location sharing in Messenger is rolling out today for everyone on iOS and Android. It banishes the blue arrow and any way to constantly share your coordinates. It’s replaced with a pin button alongside those for sending photos, stickers, or money, or an option in the three-dot More drawer. Tapping it pulls up a map with your current location pinned, which you can send to friends with one more tap. This makes it easy to tell a friend “Here’s where I am, come meet me.” By dragging the map, you can change the pin’s location. That lets you pick a meetup spot. You can also use suggestion of nearby Facebook Places like local businesses, or search for one to set the pin to a specific destination. Chudnovsky says trying to do something similar by opening Google Maps would take “7 taps, 2 app switches, and 150% frustration.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nComputer Scientists Are Astir After Baidu Team Is Barred From A.I. Competition: A group of researchers at the Chinese web services company Baidu have been barred from participating in an international competition for artificial intelligence technology after organizers discovered that the Baidu scientists broke the contest’s rules. The competition, which is known as the “Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge,” is organized annually by computer scientists at Stanford University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Michigan. It requires that computer systems created by the teams classify the objects in a set of digital images into 1,000 different categories. The rules of the contest permit each team to run test versions of their programs twice weekly ahead of a final submission as they train their programs to “learn” what they are seeing. However, on Tuesday, the contest organizers posted a public statement noting that between November and May 30, different accounts had been used by the Baidu team to submit more than 200 times to the contest server, “far exceeding the specified limit of two submissions per week.” This year, Baidu announced that it had built a custom supercomputer named Minwa with the intention of dedicating it to the image recognition contest. Baidu researchers subsequently made a series of announcements about the success of the computer, including one playing up a result more accurate than an earlier score by Google scientists. On May 4, Baidu posted an article on its technology blog headlined “Baidu Achieves Top Results on Image Recognition Challenge.” The article has since been removed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZomato’s revenue and operating loss more than tripled last year; Meritnation’s growth slowed to a crawl: Zomato, which recently expanded to allow food orders online and has been aggressively expanding overseas with as many as nine firms in its kitty in the past 12 months alone, saw operating revenue rise over three times from INR 30.6 crore in FY14 to INR 96.7 crore last year. Its operating EBITDA loss in the same period also more than tripled to INR 136 crore from INR 41.39 crore in the year ended March 31, 2014.

Facebook, which bought Instagram in 2012, has kept the mobile photo-sharing service mostly free of advertising, allowing only a handful of big brands to put a few carefully drafted commercial messages on the service. But on Tuesday, the company announced plans to open the Instagram feed to all advertisers, from the local tattoo parlor to global food makers, later this year. Marketers will be able to target ads to the service’s 300 million users by interest, age, gender and other factors, just as they can on Facebook. Instagram will also begin testing a type of ad that allows viewers to click on a link to buy a product or install an app that is advertised. The commercialization of Instagram, while sure to disappoint some users, was probably inevitable. Major social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest have committed to keep their services free to users, and they have turned to advertising to pay the bills. Instagram offered its first ads in November 2013, but since it has been subsidized by Facebook, it has had time to develop an ad strategy. Many retailers already use third-party workarounds, such as Curalate’s Like2Buy tool, to allow fans to shop their Instagram feeds. Visitors to the Instagram pages of Target, Nordstrom, Forever 21, Williams-Sonoma and other retailers can click on a special link that the store posts in its account description that leads to a mirror image of its Instagram feed — but one where photos are clickable and link to product pages where a shopper can buy the items.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore On Instagram\\'s Monetization: Instagram Unleashes a Fully Operational Ad Business With shopping links and Facebook-powered targeting: Instagram\\'s ad business is growing up fast thanks to a boost of new technology from Facebook. Today, the popular photo-sharing app with more than 300 million users and counting is opening up to potentially millions of advertisers, with more ad styles and sophisticated targeting tools first honed by its parent company. Instagram is launching ads with \"Shop Now\" buttons and other messages that link outside the app so users can take marketable action. Also, there\\'s a new API—software platform—that lets marketing partners automate the advertising process. The API comes polished—able to manage, track and measure marketing campaigns—thanks to borrowed technology and lessons learned from Facebook, said James Quarles, Instagram\\'s global head of business and brand development. Advertisers can reach users based on more than just their ages and genders, targeting interests gleaned from Facebook profiles. \"We have benefitted greatly from being a part of Facebook,\" Quarles said. \"It would have taken us years to build this tech stack for ourselves. So, we\\'re fortunate to be able to take select pieces of Facebook\\'s tech stack.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon Debuts Free Shipping on Small Goods, No Minimum Order: Amazon.com is introducing free shipping on thousands of popular, smaller items -- makeup, mobile phone accessories, earplugs -- in its Web store, without requiring a minimum order. The new initiative applies to all customers, including those not enrolled in Amazon Prime, the annual membership program that includes two-day shipping, the company said on Tuesday. Amazon is using the free shipping program to target cost-conscious shoppers, a group that EBay Inc. is courting. Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos has focused on increasing the value of the $99-a-year Prime membership, adding same-day delivery in big cities, video streaming and music. By offering free shipping, the Seattle-based online retailer will be able to target a wider pool of customers and market its services, including Prime membership. The new offer gives online shoppers an opportunity to order inexpensive goods one at a time without worrying that shipping costs are more than the price of the item or feeling compelled to buy additional products to meet a free-shipping threshold. The service covers items that weigh 8 ounces (230 grams) or less, which usually cost no more than $10. Delivery will take four to eight business days from a new shipping hub in Florence, Kentucky, specifically stocked for the program dubbed Fulfillment by Amazon Small and Light.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPinterest Brings E-Commerce to Social Scrapbooking With ‘Buy It’ Button: Pinterest, the online social scrapbooking service, has long claimed to help people discover new things in the real world. Soon users will be able to buy those things, too. The San Francisco company announced Tuesday that it would offer the ability to buy products from inside of pinned items, in what is its first foray into e-commerce on its service. The new product, named “buyable pins,” allows sellers large and small to place a “Buy it” button on items that they post to the site. Founded in 2009 by the entrepreneur Ben Silbermann and some of his colleagues, Pinterest quickly caught on as a sort of digital scrapbook where people could save things that drew their interest online. A user may come across an interesting pair of jeans on the web, for example, and “pin” a photo of those jeans to a Pinterest board. The idea was that users could collect items that they may find or buy later. But there was no way to purchase items directly on Pinterest, so for many users, the idea of buying their saved items was largely aspirational. That changes with buyable pins, as Pinterest, which has raised more than $1.3 billion in venture capital, works to justify its valuation of $11 billion. While the company does not disclose its number of users, estimates place its audience in the United States at more than 75 million, according to the online analytics firm comScore. With buyable pins, Pinterest has teamed up with major retailers like Cole Haan, Ethan Allen, Kate Spade and Macy’s. More than two million blue “Buy it” buttons will appear on products posted to Pinterest by these companies. Payments made through the service will be powered by Stripe, an e-commerce start-up that focuses on small and midsize online businesses. Braintree, a payments processing company owned by PayPal, will also handle processing. Other merchants will be able to sell items on Pinterest using Shopify, which does the heavy lifting of online commerce for smaller, independent businesses. The move is a major moneymaking opportunity for Pinterest and perhaps an obvious one for the company, which has been around for close to six years but has only recently pushed heavily into generating revenue. In December, the company introduced its first major advertising effort with its “promoted pins” product; the announcement Tuesday is the company’s first real effort at building an e-commerce site. Pinterest does not plan to make money off e-commerce the traditional way, by taking a cut of retailers’ transactions. Instead, the company said, it would make money selling promoted-pins advertisements to retailers, who can then insert buyable pins into those ads.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTech boom lures Indian engineers back home: Kunal Bahl\\'s American dream was coming together in late 2007. He had Ivy League degrees in business and engineering, a debut job at Microsoft Corp. and a roadmap to the career he’d always wanted in Silicon Valley. Then his application for a U.S. visa was rejected and he was kicked out the country. Lucky for him. Back in India, he got over the shock and founded a company in New Delhi with a childhood friend. Today Snapdeal.com is one of the most highly valued startups in the world’s third-largest economy, valued at about $5 billion. The 31-year-old is one of the thousands of a generation of engineers and entrepreneurs who quit America for home — some by choice, some because of U.S. immigration barriers — to find a technology industry with more green-field opportunities than Silicon Valley. Many Indians aren’t leaving at all, or are going to the U.S. for degrees from Harvard and Stanford with no plans to stay after graduation. India\\'s booming startup culture probably wouldn’t feel any affects if the H-1B floodgates suddenly opened. The super-growth potential these days is east, not west. While only about 19 percent of Indians are connected to the Internet, their numbers are mushrooming. Economic output is expanding at an annual rate of more than 7 percent, and by some projections the country\\'s population will reach 1.6 billion to surpass China’s by 2050. India is hard to resist. Google engineering executives Peeyush Ranjan and Punit Soni recently left the company and California for home, moving to Bangalore to join Flipkart, India\\'s largest e-commerce company and Snapdeal’s main domestic rival. Namita Gupta departed Facebook for Zomato, a restaurant-search service based in New Delhi. The trend is a dramatic shift from the 1980s and 1990s, when a graduate education and employment in the U.S. were the brass rings for engineers like Satya Nadella, Microsoft\\'s chief executive officer. Now for anyone interested in programming or e-commerce or mobile-device apps, India \"is like the late 1990s in the U.S.,\" says Bahl. Venture capitalists and hedge funds are swooping in with aims to profit on startups like Snapdeal. Venture financing in Indian tech companies hit $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter, almost six times the $325 million in the year-earlier period, according to CB Insights. Hedge funds, investment firms and asset managers have pumped $3.8 billion into 26 Indian tech startups since the beginning of last year, according to data compiled by Bengaluru-based Tracxn. \"Investors are writing big checks even by Valley standards.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRussia\\'s Internet Research Agency deploys an army of well-paid “trolls” that seek to wreak havoc all around the Internet - The New York Times investigates. A New York Times report investigates a shadowy organization in St. Petersburg, Russia, that spreads false information on the Internet. It has gone by a few names, but I will refer to it by its best known: the Internet Research Agency. The agency had become known for employing hundreds of Russians to post pro-Kremlin propaganda online under fake identities, including on Twitter, in order to create the illusion of a massive army of supporters; it has often been called a “troll farm.” The word “troll” was popularized in the early 1990s to denounce the people who derailed conversation on Usenet discussion lists with interminable flame wars, or spammed chat rooms with streams of disgusting photos, choking users with a cloud of filth. As the Internet has grown, the problem posed by trolls has grown more salient even as their tactics have remained remarkably constant. Today an ISIS supporter might adopt a pseudonym to harass a critical journalist on Twitter, or a right-wing agitator in the United States might smear demonstrations against police brutality by posing as a thieving, violent protester. Any major conflict is accompanied by a raging online battle between trolls on both sides. As former employees describe it, the Internet Research Agency had industrialized the art of trolling. Management was obsessed with statistics — page views, number of posts, a blog’s place on LiveJournal’s traffic charts — and team leaders compelled hard work through a system of bonuses and fines. “It was a very strong corporate feeling,” Savchuk says. Her schedule gave her two 12-hour days in a row, followed by two days off. Over those two shifts she had to meet a quota of five political posts, 10 nonpolitical posts and 150 to 200 comments on other workers’ posts. The grueling schedule wore her down. She began to feel queasy, she said, posting vitriol about opposition leaders of whom she had no actual opinion, or writing nasty words about Ukrainians when some of her closest acquaintances, including her own ex-husband, were Ukrainian. Russia’s information war might be thought of as the biggest trolling operation in history, and its target is nothing less than the utility of the Internet as a democratic space.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

Recent months have seen a flurry of deals in the semiconductor sector, a business that has become prohibitively expensive for all but the biggest players. On Monday, Intel, the world’s largest maker of chips, said it would pay $16.7 billion for chip company Altera. Last week, Avago Technologies agreed to pay $37 billion for Broadcom. And in March, a company called NXP Semiconductors paid $11.8 billion for Freescale Semiconductor, which began life as part of Motorola and specializes in chips for sensors and cars. “Ten years ago the cost from designing a new chip to making it a product was $10 million to $50 million,” said Mark Hung, an analyst with Gartner. “Today it’s $100 million to $200 million. Solving weird and challenging physics problems at this small size requires a lot of expensive equipment. That’s why there’s all this M.&A.” Besides gaining so-called economies of scale, Intel hopes Altera puts it in better shape for two of the biggest emerging markets, large data centers and the so-called Internet of Things, or computer-enriched machines that work with other devices. Altera’s primary chips help Intel target that market. The San Jose, Calif., company’s chips can be reprogrammed once they leave the foundry, altering some of their functions. Intel’s semiconductors are more powerful, but lack that flexibility. By combining the two types on a single chip, Intel thinks that by late next year it can start offering its big business customers ways of fine-tuning performance to suit specific needs. Also, Intel has fallen behind another big chip company, Qualcomm, in the market for low-powered chips that run mobile devices even as sales of chips for personal computers have slowed. For Intel, improving what it can do in newer, growing sectors is essential. Shares of Altera closed Monday up 5.8 percent. Intel shares were down about 1.6 percent.\\n\\n\\nIntel’s $16.7 Billion Altera Deal Is Fueled by Data Centers: Intel Corp. agreed to buy Altera Corp. for $16.7 billion to defend its presence in data centers, forging a deal that will add to a record year for industry consolidation. The world’s largest chipmaker will pay $54 a share in cash for the maker of programmable logic semiconductors, Intel said in a statement Monday. That’s a premium of 11 percent over Altera’s closing share price on Friday and 56 percent from March 26, the day before the possibility of a transaction was first reported. Intel, like other chipmakers, is seeking to contend with growth and rising costs, while trying to defend its most profitable business. The largest deal ever in the $300 billion semiconductor business was announced last week when Avago Technologies Ltd. agreed to buy Broadcom Corp. for $37 billion. Acquiring Altera may help Intel defend and extend its most profitable business: supplying server chips used in data centers. While sales of semiconductors for PCs are declining as more consumers rely on tablets and smartphones to get online, the data centers needed to churn out information and services for those mobile devices are driving orders for higher-end Intel processors and shoring up profitability. Sales at Intel’s data-center division rose 19 percent in the first quarter as Internet companies such as Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. built out their server operations. As a part of Intel, Altera will continue to support designs that couple its chips with others designed on ARM Holdings Plc technology. Companies such as Qualcomm Inc. are preparing to use that to try to break Intel’s dominance in data-center chips, where it has more than 98 percent of the market.\\n\\n\\nThe history of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) - the long life of a quick fix: Internet protocol  from 1989 leaves data vulnerable to hijackers: “Short-term solutions tend to stay with us for a very long time. And long-term solutions tend to never happen.”  Such is the story of the “three-napkins protocol,” more formally known as Border Gateway Protocol, or BGP. At its most basic level, BGP helps routers decide how to send giant flows of data across the vast mesh of connections that make up the Internet. With infinite numbers of possible paths — some slow and meandering, others quick and direct — BGP gives routers the information they need to pick one, even though there is no overall map of the Internet and no authority charged with directing its traffic. The creation of BGP, which relies on individual networks continuously sharing information about available data links, helped the Internet continue its growth into a worldwide network. But BGP also allows huge swaths of data to be “hijacked” by almost anyone with the necessary skills and access. The main reason is that BGP, like many key systems on the Internet, is built to automatically trust users — something that may work on smaller networks but leaves a global one ripe for attack. Hijackings have become routine events that even experts struggle to explain: What made traffic between two computers in Denver take a 7,000-mile detour through Iceland? How could a single Pakistani company crash YouTube? Why did potentially sensitive Pentagon data once flow through Beijing? To these questions, there are technical answers. But they all boil down to this fact: BGP runs on the honor system, allowing data to get pushed and pulled across the planet in curious ways, at the behest of mysterious masters. In 1989, when BGP was devised, the big issue of the day was the possibility that the Internet might break down. A halt in its furious expansion would have hurt the network’s users and the profits of companies supplying gear and services. Rekhter at the time worked for computing giant IBM; Lougheed was a founding employee of Cisco, maker of networking hardware. “We needed to sell routers. And we had a strong economic motive to make sure this party would continue,” Lougheed said. “When Yakov and I showed up with a solution and it seemed to work, people were quite willing to accept it because they didn’t have anything else.” There were other efforts underway to build routing protocols. BGP won out because it was simple, solved the problem at hand and proved versatile enough to keep data flowing as the Internet doubled in size, again and again and again. Networks across the world embraced the protocol, giving it an edge it has never relinquished. Once technologies are widely deployed, they become almost impossible to replace because many users — including paying customers of technology companies — rely on them and resist buying costly new hardware or software. The result can be a steady buildup of outdated technology, one layer on top of another. It’s as if today’s most important bank vaults sit on foundations of straw and mud.\\n\\n\\nJust Dial’s Q4 revenue up 26%: mulls buy-back of shares: Online local business search engine company Just Dial Ltd reported earnings: Annual operating revenue increased by 28 per cent to Rs 589.80 crore over FY14 for the full year ended March 31, 2015. The firm’s operating income rose 25.8 per cent at Rs 156.28 crore during the quarter against Rs 124.21 crore in Q4 FY14. Founded by Mani in 1994, Just Dial is a local search firm that provides listings of small and medium businesses across the country. Lately it has been expanding its business by adding transaction services for its merchants allowing consumers to buy products and services from third-party vendors like a marketplace. With the most recent addition of products, it has become the first significant listed firm involved in product e-commerce marketplace. Last month, one of the early investors of the company, Tiger Global exited from the firm. Meanwhile, the company said that a meeting of the board of directors will be held on June 4, to consider the proposal to buy-back the fully paid-up equity shares of the firm.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an\\xa0audio (MP3) version of this snippet. Experimental.\\n\\n\\n\\nSnapchat Said to Be Valued at $16 Billion in New Fundraising: Snapchat raised $537.6 million in a sale of common stock, with the funding round valuing the messaging startup at about $16 billion. The company may raise as much as $650 million in the round, according to a filing Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That would bring Snapchat’s total financing to more than $1.2 billion, according to Crunchbase, as the company builds its business in pursuit of an eventual initial public offering. By raising the latest funding in common stock, Snapchat is bucking convention for later-stage venture deals, which tend to include preferred-stock provisions that allow investors to decrease their risk. “Investing in common stock, especially at a $16 billion valuation, is not normal,” said Anand Sanwal, chief executive officer of venture-capital data firm CB Insights. “It highlights the leverage that Snapchat had in these negotiations because the investors aren’t getting the protections they normally ask for.”\\n\\n\\nIntel is close to clinching a takeover of fellow chip maker Altera for more than $15 billion, the latest sign of consolidation in the semiconductor industry. Intel is expected to pay about $54 a share for Altera, whose specialized chip designs would help Intel expand beyond chips for personal computers. An agreement could be announced as early next week, though sources cautioned that talks are continuing and might still collapse. The two sides had been in talks already this year, though the discussions were eventually delayed when Altera rejected an offer in the ballpark of $54 a share. But after the talks ended, Altera reported quarterly earnings that fell below expectations. Meanwhile, one investor, TIG Advisors, began to publicly campaign for a resumption of talks with Intel. If completed, a takeover would be the latest among chip makers as companies seek larger scale and more diversified offerings. Growing and having more products can give those manufacturers greater savings and negotiating leverage with customers. On Thursday, Avago Technologies struck a roughly $37 billion acquisition of Broadcom to break into the top tier of semiconductor companies. Intel and Altera both make semiconductors, but vastly different types. Intel is known primarily for the standard chips that go into personal computers and computer servers. They consist of millions of transistors, and once created, their performance can be adjusted only slightly by changing the software that works with them. Altera’s chips — known as field programmable gate arrays, or F.P.G.A.s — are lower in power and performance but can be altered after manufacturing to carry out different functions. That gives them far greater flexibility. Intel may be seeking Altera to create computers that combine the power of a standard semiconductor with the flexibility of an F.P.G.A., by means of a board with both types of chip. This could potentially give Intel the ability to build, for example, a computer server that can add functions so it lasts longer inside a corporate data center. This move would reflect several recent trends in the industry. Giant cloud computing centers have become an increasingly large part of Intel’s business, made even more significant as smartphones have lowered the demand for “Intel Inside” personal computers. Intel now has dedicated sales teams working with big chip consumers, like Amazon.com, that tell the company its specific computing needs for its giant cloud systems. In addition, Intel is now concentrating on at least 200 companies that are building significant computing clouds. Adding F.P.G.A.s might be a good way to help companies customize those data centers.\\n\\n\\nSocial Networking App Path Sells Itself To Korean Messaging Heavyweight Daum Kakao. It isn’t often that a company in Asia acquires a U.S. rival, particularly one that has surfed a wave of hype in Silicon Valley. But that’s exactly what happened this week after Path announced the sale of its flagship app to Korea’s Daum Kakao. The deal is undisclosed, but, as a real acquisition involving two consumer messaging apps, it is notable, particularly as the mobile messaging space transitions from a period of hyper growth to one of consolidation and services. Most people interested in tech are familiar with Path. The five-year-old service burst onto the scene as a beautifully designed, mobile-first alternative to Facebook with a number of features to set it apart from the social network.  Ultimately, Path didn’t break out of Silicon Valley and go mainstream in the U.S., but it did make inroads in Asia — particularly in Indonesia. The company is said to have 23 million registered users, four million of whom are in the Southeast Asia country, as of October last year. Path began to focus more intently on Asia with its redesign in 2013, while it took money from Indonesia’s Bakrie Global Group as part of a $25 million Series C last year. Daum Kakao is less known, particularly in the U.S.. The organization was formed when Korean internet firm Daum merged with domestic messaging app company Kakao in a $2.9 billion deal last year. The company’s Kakao Talk app is perhaps the best example of how a messaging app has impacted media and internet distribution — which is where the trend is moving in the U.S. and other countries. Though it has a small global presence — its 160 million registered userbase is far lower than key rivals — the app is installed on over 95 percent of smartphones in its native Korea, where it offers free texts and calls, games, a payment service, taxi-hailing and more. The 2015 Mary Meeker internet trends report, released this week, ranked Kakao Talk as the top messaging app worldwide based on user engagement. Another indicator of its stickiness is that its games business utterly dominates Korea’s iOS and Android app stores, according to data from App Annie. Indonesia is the largest country in Southeast Asia with a population of over 250 million. It was well-known for being the last major market where BlackBerry had any kind of mainstream presence but that’s changed now. The rise of affordable Android smartphones — particularly glamorous sub-$300 devices from the likes of Xiaomi — sent BlackBerry’s sales plummeting. But, the result of BlackBerry’s years of dominance is that there is no single messaging app that dominates Indonesia. That’s unlike other parts of Asia — China (WeChat), India, Singapore and Malaysia (WhatsApp), Japan, Thailand and Taiwan (Line), Philippines (Viber) — where the leadership has been established. With a large population up for grabs and the sizable following that Path enjoys in the country, Daum Kakao is buying itself a larger chunk of the market with this deal. It may also bolster its presence in other parts of Asia, where Daum Kakao claimed Path has 10 million registered users.\\n\\n\\nNetflix now accounts for almost 37 percent of American Internet traffic: Netflix\\'s share of Internet traffic is exploding. The streaming service now accounts for 36.5 percent of all bandwidth consumed by North American Web users during primetime, according to the Canada-based network firm Sandvine. That\\'s way up from even last November, when Sandvine estimated Netflix\\'s bandwidth footprint at 34.9 percent of Internet traffic. Sandvine\\'s regular reports on Internet usage — based on traffic as it passes through its systems — have become a reliable indicator of which services are taking up the most bandwidth. Both the season five premiere of \"Game of Thrones\" and the most recent \"Call of Duty\" downloadable content led to massive spikes in data consumption, the latest report also finds.\\n\\n\\nNetflix, for better or worse, has become the symbol for net neutrality, which has become a key issue in how regulators analyze proposed cable and telecom mergers. To many in the cable and broadband businesses, the invisible hand of Netflix has been apparent in the failed Comcast-Time Warner Cable combination; in likely restrictions on the merger between AT&T and DirecTV; and in the Obama administration’s embrace of net neutrality, to cite just three prominent examples. A pivotal moment in the net neutrality struggle came last year when Netflix agreed to pay Comcast so-called interconnection fees, a deal that Netflix’s Mr. Hastings last month called a “deal with the devil.” (While Comcast has drawn the brunt of Mr. Hastings’s ire, Netflix also reached similar interconnection deals with every other major Internet service provider.) But securing payment from Netflix for fast and more reliable access may have been a Pyrrhic victory for Comcast and the other the broadband providers. Until then the notion of net neutrality had been something of an abstraction. But when Netflix subscribers found their programs constantly interrupted for “buffering” (an interruption to download more data), the ability of Internet providers to play favorites seemed all too real. Once Netflix started paying fees to Comcast, its customers suddenly found their service improved substantially. Netflix’s experience with Comcast became Exhibit A with the F.C.C. when Netflix opposed the proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger. “The combined company would possess even more anti-competitive leverage to charge arbitrary interconnection tolls for access to their customers,” Netflix said in a letter to shareholders opposing the merger. It probably didn’t hurt Netflix’s case that just about everyone in Washington watches the hit Netflix series “House of Cards,” and Comcast is the dominant Internet provider there. Tom Wheeler, the F.C.C. chairman, said he, too, had suffered buffering problems, which he called “exasperating.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an\\xa0audio (MP3) version of this snippet. Experimental\\n\\n\\nAmazon offers limited free shipping on same-day delivery orders; a study shows same-day delivery, free returns get shoppers online:\\xa0Amazon.com Inc said on Thursday it will offer limited free same-day delivery under its Prime shipping service as retailers try to outdo each other on delivery deals, and expanded the service to San Diego and the Tampa Bay Area. Amazon offers same-day delivery to Prime members for $5.99 per order and non-members for $8.99, plus 99 cents per unit. The online retailer will allow Prime members free same-day shipping on orders over $35, Greg Greeley, head of Prime, told Reuters. \"We know same-day delivery volumes will grow dramatically now that we are making it free,\" he said. Amazon\\'s announcement comes within days of rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc saying it plans to test a new unlimited online shipping service this summer for $50 per year, a move that may hurt Amazon, which has an annual $99 Prime shipping service. Prime has become the cornerstone of Amazon\\'s growth - and a testing ground for new services ranging from television programs and movies to delivery-by-drone. In 2014, Amazon spent billions of dollars on Prime shipping and has invested $1.3 billion in its Prime video service. Earlier this year Amazon said U.S. Prime membership increased 50 percent in 2014. In December, it said customers ordered more than 10 times as many items via same-day delivery this holiday season, compared to a year earlier. A recent study of 1,400 online shoppers by Walker Sands Communications found that free shipping was the feature most likely to get people to shop online, followed by free returns and one-day shipping.\\n\\n\\nAs usual, a slew of announcements at Google I/O: Google introduced technologies ranging from a brand new mobile-payments system to a virtual-reality camera rig in front of more than 6,000 software engineers at the Web company\\'s I/O developer\\'s conference in San Francisco.\\xa0A security makeover for Android: Android M: The next iteration of Google\\'s operating system, which runs on 79 percent of smartphones around the globe, is getting a security makeover, with more robust privacy controls and restrictions on apps\\' data access.

Google on Thursday confirmed the arrival of Android Pay and a revamped Google Wallet, an overhaul of the company’s mobile payments products. Both products are a shift from the company’s past mobile commerce efforts, which largely flopped. The new services, like the world of payments in general, are not simple. Here is how they work. Android Pay is essentially a digital payments system that consumers can use to buy things online or in stores from retailers and others who also use the service. It works almost the same way that Apple Pay, Apple’s mobile payments product, functions both in online and offline transactions. To use Android Pay, smartphone users with up-to-date versions of the Android operating system will be able to load Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover cards onto their phones. From there, they will be able to wave the phone over the terminals in more than 700,000 stores around the United States to pay for items. Android Pay will also work inside mobile apps from participating developers. Google will use a technology called tokenization to provide merchants with a customer’s payment information without having to hand over their actual credit card number. As with Apple Pay, Google will let customers verify their identity using their fingerprint, a technique which will be built into the next version of Android. Android Pay will also integrate with loyalty programs from a handful of retail partners, which will mean that any points or credits earned at —the point of sale will automatically be added to any loyalty card a customer enters. To date, Apple Pay does not offer this service, an issue that many merchants have asked for privately. Apple plans to discuss its loyalty integration plans at the company’s developer conference next month. Google Wallet, the company’s unsuccessful attempt at a mobile wallet, is not going away. It is just going to serve another purpose. Google Wallet is being reintroduced as a peer-to-peer payments app, which is a way for customers to quickly and easily transfer money to each other’s debit or bank accounts. That once again pits Google against PayPal, which offers its own popular peer-to-peer payments app called Venmo. It also clashes with Square Cash, yet another peer-to-peer payments app offered by Square. Such services have become popular with younger users. Now all Google, Apple and PayPal have to do is persuade consumers that these new payment methods are better than paying the same way they have always done — smartphone-free.\\n\\n\\nAvago to buy Broadcom for $37 billion in biggest-ever chip deal: Avago Technologies agreed on Thursday to buy Broadcom Corp for $37 billion in the largest merger of chipmakers ever, turning a lesser known company run by a ferocious dealmaker into one of the biggest industry players. Avago, which serves the wireless and industrial markets, is offering Broadcom shareholders $17 billion in cash and Avago shares valued at $20 billion. Broadcom is best known for its connectivity chips, which are used widely in smartphones made by Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics. The deal is the biggest so far by Avago Chief Executive Hock Tan, who has developed a small chipmaker into a $36 billion company through acquisitions since taking the helm nine years ago. Tan, a serial deal-maker, has trimmed Avago\\'s portfolio by divesting units while bulking up in faster-growing areas. The combined company, to be based in Singapore and known as Broadcom, will be the third-largest U.S. semiconductor maker by revenue, behind Intel Corp and Qualcomm. The merger is the industry\\'s second megadeal this year and is unlikely to be the last, analysts said. The merger will help the companies improve their bargaining position with manufacturers. Irvine, California-based Broadcom has been struggling to grow as competition in the mobile chip business intensifies. The company\\'s revenue increased by just 1.5 percent last year. The new Broadcom would have annual revenue of $15 billion and an enterprise value of $77 billion, the companies said in a statement. Broadcom shareholders will own about 32 percent of the combined company. They would also have the option to choose between various combinations of cash and stock. Avago, which is incorporated in Singapore and also has headquarters in San Jose, California, said it intended to fund the cash portion of the deal by using funds from the combined company and new debt of $9 billion.\\n\\n\\nAvago\\'s $37 billion deal to buy chipmaker Broadcom Corp may force Qualcomm, the world\\'s largest mobile chip maker to radically rethink its own strategy: Qualcomm, which has dominated the market for connectivity chips on smartphones, has been looking to extend its reach into data centers and network infrastructure, but may find its way blocked by an enlarged competitor combining Avago\\'s strength in storage and Broadcom\\'s power in networking. \"Qualcomm has aspirations of moving into Intel\\'s data center processor incumbency that the Avago storage and now enterprise networking (from Broadcom) capability directly overlays,\" said Drexel Hamilton analyst Richard Whittington. That could result in Qualcomm creating some sort of partnership with Intel Corpx he said, to combat the reach of the new company. Wall Street analysts generally cheered the deal on Thursday, despite some fretting about price, saying Broadcom\\'s strength in wireless networking, WiFi and Bluetooth chips is a good complement to Avago\\'s presence in industrial and wired devices. That presents a challenge to Qualcomm, which finds itself in a tough spot in the maturing microprocessor business, as smartphone makers such as Samsung, Apple and Huawei put more effort into producing their own chips. Now a Avago/Broadcom tie-up - which will take the name of Broadcom - potentially gives handset makers another viable supplier, giving them more leverage and putting even more pressure on Qualcomm, said IDC analyst Mario Morales.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\xa0is an audio (MP3) version of this snippet. Experimental.\\n\\n\\nMary Meeker\\'s 2015 Report is Out, and Calls Out that India Tech is at an Inflection Point: Kleiner Perkins partner Mary Meeker’s yearly Internet Trends report is the ultimate compilation of essential tech statistics.  Here is her 2015 report, which\\xa0 calls out that India could be at a tipping point. India\\'s Internet penetration in 2014 was where China was in 2008 and the U.S. was in 1996. If India\\'s curve follows the same pattern, get ready for big things in the next five years. One thing India is lacking is the catalyst companies that will lead its Internet revolution. \\n\\n\\nNielsen to measure digital ads in partnership with Tencent: Nielsen announced on Wednesday that it is partnering with Tencent Holdings to measure its digital audience in a move that could direct more ad dollars from companies in the United States to China\\'s biggest social network. Nielsen said it is launching its Digital Ad Ratings, which tracks unique users, reach and frequency of a digital ad across computers, tablets and smartphones for the first time in China. Comscore, which offers a similar service and competes with Nielsen, said it is already available in China. The online gaming company Tencent, which also operates the popular mobile messaging app WeChat with 500 million monthly active users, has been making a big push to increase its advertising revenue especially through mobile. Nielsen will measure an ad campaign in a combination of surveys, consisting of 46,000 Chinese consumers, and aggregated, anonymous data from Tencent\\'s hundreds of millions of active users. Tencent, which has a market value of $190 billion and reported first-quarter online advertising revenue of $438.4 million competes with Alibaba and Baidu. \\n\\n\\nIts a Small World: Ola-owned TaxiForSure integrates Alibaba-investee Paytm wallet as cashless payment option, joining its arch-rival Uber: TaxiForSure, has tied up with Alibaba-backed online payments platform Paytm. The move will allow users of TaxiForSure to go cashless and pay through Paytm’s pre-paid wallet, the company said in a statement. Customers can link their debit card or bank account via a Paytm wallet or recharge their Paytm wallet and use it to pay for their rides. In March, cab hiring startup Ola had acquired TaxiForSure in what largely a stock transaction. Interestingly, Ola also has a prepaid wallet called Ola Money. Last November, on-demand car service Uber, Ola\\'s arch-rival in India\\'s ride-hailing space had joined hands with Paytm.\\n\\n\\nGoogle and Apple Adjust Their Strategies on Mobile Payments: The battle for mobile software dominance revolves around two companies: Apple and Google. Now both giants are also going head-to-head in mobile payments, as they prepare to push deeper into digital wallets. Google is set to unveil plans at its annual developer conference on Thursday for an overhaul of its mobile payment products. Changes include a service called Android Pay that will let merchants accept credit card payments from inside their mobile apps and can be integrated with loyalty programs at retailers, the people said. Google Wallet, a mobile commerce app, will also be reintroduced as a peer-to-peer payments app that consumers can use to send money to each other directly from their debit accounts, they said. Apple is preparing to announce details about enhancements to Apple Pay at its software conference next month. Those include a rewards program for the mobile wallet service. The moves are the latest advances in mobile payments as several players jockey for an edge. With more consumers willing to make purchases using smartphones, companies are rushing to take the lead in the market, spurring eBay’s PayPal to heavily market a suite of mobile apps, while start-ups like Square and Stripe expand their payments processing software to small and midsize businesses. The stakes are also high for Apple and Google, which are entering mobile payments later than others in the industry. For Apple, mobile payments tie people more directly to its main product, the iPhone. For Google, payments are a hook to reel people into its ecosystem of services and another way to gain insight about consumers. The challenge for Apple and Google, along with rivals, is that the mobile wallet is generally a technology in search of a problem. Cash and credit cards are easy to use and accepted broadly worldwide. As a result, the mobile wallet is typically more of a supplementary service than a replacement. Nonetheless, mobile payments are growing quickly. Forrester Research predicts they will balloon to $142 billion by 2019 in the United States, almost tripling from $52 billion in 2014. Still, Google and Apple offer something that few others can: Hardware, software and an insatiable desire to win. “Google and Apple have deep pockets and the appetite to invest,” said Sucharita Mulpuru of Forrester Research. “They may create something that is a lasting disruption.”\\n\\n\\nDespite Its Dominance, Analysts See A Murky Road Ahead for Android:  Android is now not just the globe’s most popular smartphone operating system but the most popular operating system of any kind. More than a billion Android devices were sold in 2014, a c cording to the research firm Gartner. That’s about five times the number of Apple iOS devices sold, and about three times the number of Windows machines sold. Yet all is not well on planet Android. On the eve of Google IO, the company’s annual developer conference that starts Thursday, where Android will once again be a primary topic of discussion, cracks are emerging in Google’s hold over the operating system. Google’s version of Android faces increasing competition from hungry rivals, including upstart smartphone makers in developing countries that are pushing their own heavily modified take on the software. There are also new threats from Apple, which has said that its recent record number of iPhone sales came, in part, thanks to people switching from Android. Hanging over these concerns is the question of the bottom line. Despite surging sales, profits in the Android smartphone business declined 44 percent in 2014, according to one estimate. Over the holidays last year, according to the research firm Strategy Analytics, Apple vacuumed up nearly 90 percent of the profits in the smartphone business. The stark numbers prompted a troubling question for Android and for Google: How will the search company — or anyone else, for that matter — ever make much money from Android? Google faces several major Android-related headaches. First, while Google makes most of its revenue from advertising, Android has so far been an ad dud compared with Apple’s iOS. iOS users tend to have more money and spend a lot more time on their phones (and are, thus, more valuable to advertisers). Because Google pays billions to Apple to make its search engine the default search provider for iOS devices, the company collects much more from ads placed on Apple devices than from ads on Android devices. A recent analysis by Goldman Sachs estimated that Google collected about $11.8 billion on mobile search ads in 2014, with about 75 percent coming from ads on iPhones and iPads. A brighter spot for Google is the revenue it collects from sales via Android’s app store, called Google Play. For years, Android apps were a backwater, but sales have picked up lately. In 2014, Google Play sold about $10 billion in apps, of which Google kept about $3 billion (the rest was paid out to developers). Apple makes more from its App Store. Sales there exceeded $14 billion in 2014, and rising iPhone sales in China have led to a growing app haul for Apple. Still, Google’s app revenue is becoming an increasingly meaningful piece of its overall business, and it is also growing rapidly. But how long Google can expect Play to keep paying remains an open question, thanks to the second Android-related headache. Google’s strategy of giving Android to phone makers free has led to a surge of new entrants in the phone business, several of which sell high-quality phones for cut-rate prices. Among those is Xiaomi, a Chinese start-up making phones that have become some of the most popular devices in China. Because Xiaomi and others don’t make much of a profit by selling phones, they’re all looking for other ways to make money — and for many, the obvious business is in apps offering mail, messaging and other services that compete with Google’s own moneymaking apps. Android has always been a tricky strategy; now, after finding huge success, it seems only to be getting even trickier.\\n\\n\\nTwitter Is Giving Advertisers More User Data In The Hope That They Spend More: Twitter is hoping to help marketers better understand their Twitter audience by adding a tool that will give them deeper user behavior around organic tweets. The audience insights dashboard tool adds some similar insights as the Facebook advertising platform with aggregate information on user demographics, interests, and purchasing behavior as well as what television shows users watch and their mobile usage. These new insights are expected to help advertisers identify a more relevant audience for upcoming campaigns on the platform. Will these new insights help boost advertising on Twitter? The company needs it right now. It had slower than expected growth in advertising sales this last quarter and even die-hard fans and early investors think the company needs some help. Early investor Chris Sacca recently scribed a blog post warning Twitter that he would soon be sharing a few thoughts on what the company needs to do now.  Offering more profound insights about organic user behavior may be an answer to some of this frustration and may help to lure brands to spend more ad dollars on the platform. The audience insights tool is now available to all Twitter advertisers and analytics users. Twitter-specific information can be accessed within the U.S., with plans to roll this out more broadly over the next few months.\\n\\n\\nCisco Predics that in 5 years, 80 percent of Internet Traffic will be online video: We already know that Netflix accounts for one-third of Internet traffic at peak hours. Toss in YouTube, and that figure rises to roughly half of all bandwidth consumed. But even that\\'s small potatoes compared with what\\'s coming. In five years, 80 percent of the entire world\\'s Internet consumption will be dominated by video. That number will be even higher in the United States, approaching 85 percent. That\\'s according to the latest projections from Cisco, which publishes an annual study peering into the near future of the Web. The newest report, out Wednesday, predicts that by 2019, the Internet will have become more or less a big video pipe. Part of the growth will come from adding new people to the Internet — for the first time, over half the world\\'s population will be digitally connected. But individual Internet users are also expected to consume more video over time, and at a higher quality, which will put tremendous new burdens on the world\\'s Internet infrastructure. When you see the Internet as a huge distribution channel for video, it puts virtually everything that tech and communications companies are doing into perspective. Telecom firms like Verizon are racing to expand their cellular networks so that they can deliver video over LTE. Cable companies are fleshing out their public WiFi hotspots so users can watch videos outside their homes. Content providers like HBO and CBS are putting their programming on the Internet so that customers don\\'t have to be tethered to their television sets. Implicit in this idea is that mobile devices will be the primary way users will access all this video. And researchers agree on that point. Five years ago, Americans were spending less than an hour a day on mobile devices. Today, it\\'s more like three hours a day, accounting for more than half of the time we spend consuming digital media in general, according to the latest in an annual report released Wednesday by Kleiner Perkins partner Mary Meeker.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAn auto-generated\\xa0audio version on SoundCloud (experimental)\\n\\n\\nFoxconn Unit Seeks the Next Xiaomi in India: For FIH Mobile Ltd., being the unit of Foxconn Technology Group that doesn’t make iPhones has been a challenge. Its former name, Foxconn International Holdings Ltd., was constantly being confused with the parent, while its business model was tied to fading phone labels including Nokia and Sony. So it changed both. Two years later, FIH has a new marquee client in fast-growing smartphone brand Xiaomi Corp. and vastly-improved earnings. In anticipation of shipments climbing 50 percent this year, it’s now looking to India in its hunt for the next big thing after profit doubled in 2014. FIH will assemble its first smartphones in India before the end of this year, prompted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to raise import tariffs, Tong said. The company will have multiple sites in the country, none employing more than 10,000 workers, he said. “We still see the growth rate will be in the emerging market brands,” he said. India could see smartphone sales of 85 million to 100 million this year in a region where emerging Asia-Pacific markets will collectively outpace China over the next four years, Tong said, citing figures from Gartner Inc.\\n\\n\\nOppo of China to Start Handset Assembly in India for Local Push: Guangdong OPPO Electronics, a Chinese maker of smartphones, will start having its own-brand handsets manufactured in India in August as a saturated home market pushes it to seek growth abroad. Oppo will have its handsets assembled by a partner in the South Asian country, rather than replicate its experience in Indonesia, where it owns a factory, said Vice President Sky Li, who oversees the company’s international mobile business. He declined to identify the partner. “India is the top priority in our expansion in South Asia,” Li said in interview in Beijing on May 20. The company “plans to boost sales volume in the country to a comparable level with China market in five years.” The Chinese phone maker is betting on demand from consumers abroad to drive growth after the domestic market recorded first decline in smartphone shipments in six years in the first quarter, with a year-on-year drop of 4 percent to 98.8 million units, market research company IDC said on May 10. Oppo isn’t alone in seeing India in its future. Xiaomi , the world’s third-largest smartphone maker, released the MI 4i model in the South Asian country last month. Rivals Huawei Technologies and Lenovo Group are also targeting India.\\n\\n\\nIn Bid to Revive Itself, EBay to Roll Out Cost-Per-Sale Ads for Web Merchants: EBay Inc. is introducing ads that merchants will pay for only if they lead to actual sales, seeking new revenue opportunities for the online marketplace before a planned split from the PayPal payments division. The service, called Promoted Listings, will let EBay sellers specify what percent of a product’s sale price they’re willing pay in order to run an advertisement. The higher the percentage, the more prominent the ad will be, although EBay will also consider a product’s popularity and the seller’s reputation. The cost-per-sale approach is unusual because websites risk running ads that don’t generate revenue. Instead, most companies, such as Google Inc., rely on cost-per-click ads, which charge marketers each time someone clicks on a link. EBay’s new ad offering will help smaller merchants, which make up the bulk of the company’s 25 million sellers, because they won’t have to track the effectiveness of ads or pay before a sale, according to Alex Linde, EBay’s vice president of advertising and monetization. “This way, there’s no upfront risk for the seller,” Linde said. “The only lever these sellers had in the past was price, and nobody wants to grow only by discounting.” While Linde didn’t specify any revenue goals for promoted-listing ads, he said EBay’s extensive data on consumers and sellers will help it direct ads to the most likely buyers. “It’s risky to guarantee a return on an ad,” said Lauren Fisher, an analyst at EMarketer Inc. “They could end up giving away a lot of advertising.” The advertising push is part of a larger effort to reinvigorate EBay’s e-commerce business, which is lagging behind the rest of the industry. Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co., sees marketplace revenue falling 4 percent to $6.7 billion, while EMarketer predicts that global e-commerce sales will rise 21 percent to $1.59 trillion in 2015. Advertising hasn’t been a priority for EBay in the past. Ad revenues are lumped into a segment that brought in $2.76 billion last year. Most of that came from banner ads promoting brands, rather than particular products. Promoted Listings will be rolled out gradually, starting in June with a few hundred sellers in the U.S., U.K., Australia and Germany. EBay also plans to come up with ways for larger merchants to promote special deals more effectively, Linde said.\\n\\n\\nYour Instagram photos aren’t really yours: Someone else can sell them for $90,000: This month, painter and photographer Richard Prince reminded us that what you post is public, and given the flexibility of copyright laws, can be shared — and sold — for anyone to see. As a part of the Frieze Art Fair in New York, Prince displayed giant screenshots of other people’s Instagram photos without warning or permission. The collection, “New Portraits,” is primarily made up of pictures of women, many in sexually charged poses. They are not paintings, but screenshots that have been enlarged to 6-foot-tall inkjet prints. According to Vulture, nearly every piece sold for $90,000 each. How is this okay? First you should know that Richard Prince has been “re-photographing” since the 1970s. He takes pictures of photos in magazines, advertisements, books or actors’ headshots, then alters them to varying degrees. Often, they look nearly identical to the originals. This has of course, led to legal trouble. In 2008, French photographer Patrick Cariou sued Prince after he re-photographed Cariou’s images of Jamaica’s Rastafarian community. Although Cariou won at first, on appeal, the court ruled that Prince had not committed copyright infringement because his works were “transformative.” In other words, Prince could make slight adjustments to the photos and call them his own. This is what he did with the Instagram photos. Although he did not alter the usernames or the photos themselves, he removed captions. He then added odd comments on each photo, such as “DVD workshops. Button down. I fit in one leg now. Will it work? Leap of faith” from the account “richardprince1234.”  The account currently has 10,200 followers but not a single picture — perhaps so you can’t steal his images in return? “New Portraits” first debuted last year at Gagosian Gallery on Madison Avenue, the same location where the artist displayed the Rastafarian images he was sued for. Knowing that more legal action is unlikely, Prince appears to be enjoying the attention. He has been re-tweeting and re-posting his many critics.\\n\\n\\nTiVo earnings: Revenue $44M, +16% Y/Y. Share Rise 6%: Digital video recorder maker TiVo  reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit, helped by higher subscriptions. Shares of the company, which also said it bought Poland-based Cubiware, rose 6.2 percent in extended trading on Tuesday. TiVo\\'s set-top boxes are in high demand from cable users as they also allow access to online video services such as Netflix  , Hulu and Google  \\'s YouTube. TiVo, whose clients  lude DirecTV, is trying to partner with more cable TV operators to grow its business. TiVo sells subscriptions directly to consumers with its video recorders and also licenses its technology to cable TV operators that rent recorders to subscribers. The company sells its products through cable TV partners such as Virgin Media in the UK, ONO in Spain and Com Hem AB in Swede Total revenue costs rose about 16 percent to $44.1 million. Net revenue rose about 7.2 percent to $114.7 million.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn Freewheeling Interview Snapchat CEO Outlines Monetization Plans, Talks Tech Bubble, IPO: Evan Spiegel is the co-founder, chief executive officer, and profane enfant terrible behind one of the largest and fastest-growing social networks on the Internet. At 24, he runs a startup with 330 employees and a valuation north of $15 billion, which claims more than 100 million mostly young users. He’s also incredibly secretive about his business plans and an unknown (and arguably underestimated) figure in the intersecting gossip circles of Silicon Valley and Hollywood. Now he’s ready to talk about a major turning point for his company. More than three years after Spiegel founded Snapchat at Stanford with his fraternity brother, Bobby Murphy, 26, he’s trying to turn it into a real business. After starting to run select video ads earlier this year, Snapchat is about to begin soliciting other big advertisers with some new numbers that assert its audience is bigger, younger, and more obsessive than anything on television. In a 23-page sales pitch it’s sending to ad agencies this month, the company says more than 60 percent of 13- to 34-year-old smartphone users in the U.S. are active on the service and together view more than 2 billion videos a day. That’s already about half the number of videos people watch on Facebook, which is seven years older and has 10 times as many members. The service isn’t accessible on the conventional Web, only via smartphones, and a central tenet of the company is that video and photos should take up the entire smartphone screen. He “believes his audience is young people on mobile,” Lasky says, “and he does not believe that the audience is being appropriately serviced by the existing Silicon Valley elites.” Actual teen behavior tells a slightly different story. Seventy-one percent of all U.S. teens age 13 to 17 use Facebook, while only 4 in 10 use Snapchat, according to a study this year by the Pew Research Center. And Snapchat’s rivals aren’t sitting still. Twitter has acquired the video-sharing services Periscope and Vine, and Facebook has another way it taps young Internet users—the photo-sharing service Instagram, which it acquired in 2012. Half of all teens use Instagram, according to Pew. Snapchat may have overestimated the pull it has with advertisers. It started its program by charging about $100 per 1,000 views, or more than $750,000 for a day-long campaign, more than double the rates of YouTube or Hulu. Big advertisers with large experimental budgets chalked the rate up to research and development costs and fell in line, just to be first with a chance at wooing a millennial audience. Occasionally the ads do find a satisfying symbiosis with the content. Earlier this month, for example, spots from Coca-Cola and the jobs site Indeed.com congratulated students in ads that were interspersed in daily stories culled from snaps on college campuses during graduation day.

Brazil and India are considering similar paths. The clampdown on patents has the potential to alter the balance of power in the global mobile-phone industry, which generated $412 billion last year, according to IDC. These new rules may weaken the ability of Apple, Microsoft Corp. and Qualcomm -- typically among the top 15 U.S. patent recipients each year -- to compete in China, the world’s largest mobile-phone market, and other countries that follow. “We’re going back to the Cold War and the domino theory,” said Bradley Lui, an antitrust lawyer with Morrison & Foerster in Washington. “The authorities in China see the potential use of patents that might affect companies in China, including state-owned enterprises. It might be an impetus for drawing rules more broadly than we would in the U.S.” Asian regulators were spurred by the smartphone wars, in which tech giants battled over billions of dollars on four continents for more than four years. Foreign governments including Korea and China have been looking more closely at their patent policies, emboldened by debates in Washington over whether patents hinder rather than spur innovation. Qualcomm, which got 63 percent of profit from patents last year, has been investigated on three continents for its licensing practices. It struck a deal with China in February that gives domestic Chinese manufacturers a discount on the royalty charges while fining the company $975 million. Microsoft’s purchase of Nokia Oyj’s handset business has been approved by every country except Korea, which is looking for concessions on some of Nokia patents. In China, Microsoft had to accept lower royalties for patents that read on Google\\'s Android operating system, which runs most of the world’s phones including those made by Chinese manufacturer ZTE. The Redmond, Washington-based company simply excluded Korean assets -- where it didn’t have many sales anyway -- from the Nokia deal.\\n\\n\\nSnapdeal buys mobile commerce platform MartMobi: In a bid to strengthen its mobility platform for merchants, Snapdeal has acquired Hyderabad-based technology startup MartMobi for an undisclosed amount. The MartMobi platform enables e-commerce businesses, brands and retailers to have an instant mobile presence without writing a single line of code. A self-service platform, MartMobi can be used to create custom applications for retailers across all major mobile platforms, thus ensuring a new source of revenue for online ventures. MartMobi was founded in December 2012 by Satya Krishna Ganni (CEO) and Pramod Nair (CTO) – both serial entrepreneurs, who had earlier co-founded LearnSocial, aP2P learning platform that brings together people who want to teach something they are passionate about. Snapdeal has been on an acquisition spree as it seeks to compete with players such as Flipkart and Amazon for a slice of the $3 billion Indian e-commerce industry. In the recent past, Snapdeal has acquired payments and mobile recharge startup FreeCharge in a cash-and-stock deal while picking up stakes in digital financial services platform RupeePower and logistics venture GoJavas.\\n\\n\\nApple Names Jony Ive ‘Chief Design Officer’: Apple’s Jony Ive, the design genius often credited for Apple’s innovative and unique industrial design language over the past couple of decades, has taken on a new role at the company: Chief Design Officer. The new role elevates him above his previous SVP status, and also installs Richard Howarth as the new head of Industrial Design, and Alan Dye as head of User Interface. Ive’s new role should actually give him more time to actually design, the newly minted C-level executive told the Telegraph. He’s shedding some administrative and management duties to his two new lieutenants, he told the newspaper, and will instead be in charge of both UI and ID, as well as take direct control over retail store design around the world. In a book detailing Ive’s life and work at Apple, Leander Kahney has noted that the British designer has sometimes been uncomfortable with the administrative side of business, and instead prefers to focus on the craft of the actual design process. Ive also notably remains off-stage during Apple’s signature press events, and instead often narrates passionate paeans the company offers during the show in the form of video on the process of designing the products announced by other execs at the events.\\n\\n\\nBaihe, a Chinese dating site where users flaunt their financial standing, bags $241M: Chinese dating site Baihe has announced it recently raised RMB 1.5 billion (US$241 million) in series D funding, according to Sina Tech. The investors have not been disclosed. Baihe approaches dating from an empirical and practical – some might say materialistic – perspective, with the end goal being marriage. Users are required to use their real names and are encouraged to share information like their property status and education. In other words, does this person own a home and have a good degree? Posting videos is also encouraged as they are more difficult to manipulate than photos. Members can verify their marital status to prove they aren’t seeking affairs. Recently, the site added a feature wherein users can post their credit score, as rated by a third-party private agency, to show they are in good financial standing. A member can only see information on other people’s profiles that they have shared themselves.\\n\\n\\nAs Facebook Sweeps Across Europe, Regulators Gird for Battle: Move over, Google. Facebook is the latest American tech giant that Europeans love to hate. For decades, European policy makers have taken aim at America’s giant tech businesses, trying to force them to play by European rules. In the past, Microsoft and Intel were found guilty of abusing their dominant positions to shut out rivals. Google has most recently been under the microscope, and it now faces accusations that it unfairly promoted some of its search products over those of competitors. In recent months, though, regulators’ gazes have turned to Facebook, raising questions about whether the social network has learned from the past mistakes of companies like Intel, Microsoft and Google when dealing with Europe’s policy makers and its legal system. And as Facebook runs into an increasing number of regulatory hurdles here, the scrutiny could potentially distract the company from its ambitions of becoming a one-stop shop for Internet messaging, online publishing and digital advertising. Facebook’s core business, its social networking service, is especially popular in Europe. The company has almost doubled its number of European users to the service, to around 260 million, since 2010. Facebook also has more users in Europe than in the United States, according to eMarketer, a research company. Regulators in Europe, however, are especially focused on how the company collects and handles those users’ data. The region has some of the world’s toughest data protection rules, and policy makers from France, Germany and Belgium are investigating whether Facebook broke Europe’s laws after the company announced a new privacy policy this year. If found to have breached the privacy rules, Facebook may face fines or demands that it change how the company handles people’s data, though the company says it complies with the region’s data protection laws. Taking a page from the playbooks of other American tech companies, Facebook has not stood idle as regulators steadily lined up against it. The company has hired a number of prominent former lawmakers and regulators, including Erika Mann, a former German member of the European Parliament. This month, the company also chose Kevin Martin, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, to champion its cause in Washington, Brussels and beyond. Facebook increased spending on lobbying 25 percent, to roughly $570,000, in 2013 compared to the previous year, according the latest figures available from the European Union’s voluntary database of lobbying interests, which may not include all of Facebook’s activities in the region.\\n\\n\\nChinese E-Commerce Giant JD Leads $70M Round In Online Produce Retailer FruitDay: Chinese e-commerce site JD.com is putting its money into fresh fruit and vegetables after it led a $70 million Series C round in FruitDay, a company that sells fresh produce across China. The investment in six-year-old FruitDay, which claims to be China’s largest online produce firm, also included participation from previous backers Susquehanna International Group (SIG) and ClearVue. FruitDay imports over 80 percent of its produce from overseas, and it claimed to be on course to hit 10 million customers before the end of the year — up fourfold from last year. The company said in a statement that it will use the new capital to develop its infrastructure and logistics, hire new management and for general business development. It stands to benefit from more than just JD.com’s money through this alliance, however, since the duo have agreed to “a strategic cooperation” which will allow FruitDay to tap into JD.com’s own logistics and fulfilment network across China to help widen its service in the country. JD.com is commonly thought of as a lesser rival to Alibaba. That’s a pretty hard comparison to shake when you consider that Alibaba was responsible for the largest IPO in U.S. history last year — its current market cap exceeds $230 billion — but JD.com is different in key areas. The company, which is listed on the Nasdaq, and has attracted investment from Alibaba’s fierce rival Tencent, is building out an Amazon-like delivery model which includes its own warehouses — something that Alibaba does not — as this recent New York Times piece points out. Things start to get even more interesting if you pair JD.com’s infrastructure efforts with WeChat, the dominant messaging app in China which is owned by JD.com investor Tencent. JD.com already has a store on WeChat were customers can make purchases without leaving the app, and it could be an interesting medium for fresh fruit and vegetable orders — that’s something Line, another chat app, is pioneering in Southeast Asia right now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle adds a Buy Button to YouTube \"TrueView\" Pre-Roll Ads - Initial Results Very Positive: Google today announced that its YouTube TrueView ad product will now come with an optional \"click to shop\" button on pre-roll spots. The new button will often appear adjacent to the \"Skip\" button that YouTube fans know very well. A few brands have been testing the ads, which allow viewers to click through to e-commerce pages and add items to their shopping carts. Per Google, home goods merchant Wayfair has been getting three times the digital revenue compared to previous YouTube campaigns, while the cosmetics retailer Sephora saw more than an 80 percent jump in brand consideration and a 54 percent lift in ad recall. The move for Google is designed to shift YouTube\\'s ad business into a higher gear as the site faces increased digital video competition—chiefly from Facebook, although Snapchat, Kik and other mobile startups also pose a threat. Jonathan Opdyke, CEO of HookLogic, predicted the feature would be a hit with merchant brands. Sridhar Ramaswamy, svp of ads and commerce at Google, revealed the new feature while speaking earlier this afternoon at the ad:tech conference in San Francisco.\\n\\n\\nAmazon to Stop Funneling European Sales Through Low-Tax Haven: In a move that could put pressure on its rivals to follow suit, Amazon will start paying taxes in a number of European countries where it has large operations, instead of funneling nearly all its sales through Luxembourg, a low-tax haven that is the home base in the region for Amazon and many other large tech companies. Several European countries, including Germany and France, have criticized the tax strategies of some American tech companies, including Google, which use complicated structures that sharply reduce the amount of tax they pay in individual European countries. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, is also investigating whether Apple and Amazon receive unfair state support through low-tax agreements in Ireland and Luxembourg, respectively, where the companies run their European operations. On May 1, Amazon said that it had started reporting revenue from its operations in Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain. By altering how it reports its revenue, the online retailer may become liable for larger tax charges in certain nations, though it may still be able to reduce its tax burden through other complex accounting practices.Amazon reported a 14 percent rise in European revenue, to 13.6 billion euros, or $15 billion, in 2013 (the latest full-year figures available), according to company filings.The changes to the company’s tax arrangements, however, are likely to put pressure on other tech companies in the United States that funnel the majority of their European revenue through low-tax countries like Ireland and the Netherlands. In Britain, George Osborne, the country’s finance minister, has championed a so-called Google Tax that imposes a 25 percent tax on the local profits of international companies that are perceived to route money unfairly overseas. The new policy came into effect last month. And in response to mounting criticism from other European countries, Ireland announced late last year that it would phase out a tax loophole called the “Double Irish” that would often be used by tech companies. The structure allows corporations with operations in Ireland to make royalty payments for intellectual property to a separate Irish-registered subsidiary. That subsidiary, though incorporated in Ireland, typically has its home in a country that has no corporate income tax. The Double Irish policy has allowed companies like Google to limit how much tax they pay on their international operations. The policy was phased out for new companies at the beginning of 2015, and will be stopped entirely by the end of the decade. Yet, despite the growing clampdown on tax structures used by American tech companies and others, analysts say that European countries are still vying to attract international companies through low-tax policies. Britain, Ireland and the Netherlands have already created new policies that allow companies to apply for a lower tax rate on profits that result from certain patents that are held locally. The European Commission, however, is currently reviewing the legality of these so-called patent boxes.\\n\\n\\nContest for Nokia\\'s maps business heats up; German carmakers, Uber and Baidu, and Tencent are all in the fray: The contest for Nokia\\'s maps business has become a three-way race between German carmakers, a consortium including Uber and Baidu, and a third group including China\\'s Tencent and Navinfo, people familiar with the process said. Finland\\'s Nokia has started an auction of its maps business HERE while it completes its 15.6 billion euros ($17.2 billion) takeover of network equipment maker Alcatel Lucent. German automakers Daimler , BMW and Volkswagen\\'s premium brand Audi have teamed up with private equity firm General Atlantic to form what is being described as the \"Industry consortium\", two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. Nokia, Daimler, BMW and General Atlantic declined to comment. The automakers have agreed to contribute potentially more than 700 million euros, but below 1 billion euros, said one auto industry source, who declined to be named. The consortium could be widened to include more carmakers, the source added. Another group consists of Chinese media, mobile and Internet services firm Tencent Holdings, Chinese map maker Navinfo, and Swedish buyout firm EQT Partners, three sources who declined to be named said. Navinfo and Tencent were not immediately available for comment. EQT declined to comment. Private equity firm Apax has joined U.S.-based taxi service Uber and China\\'s Baidu in a third consortium, a financial source who declined to be named said. Apax and Uber declined to comment. Baidu was not immediately available for comment. Analysts put the potential value of HERE at 2 billion euros to 4 billion euros.\\n\\n\\nChinese Car-Hailing App, Backed by Both Alibaba and Tencent, Gives Away Free Rides to Fend Off Uber: Chinese car-hailing app operator Didi Kuaidi will give away 1 billion yuan ($161 million) worth of rides to commuters starting next week to promote its new chauffeur service. The company, backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., is expanding into the market for ride-sharing and carpooling after winning an estimated 99 percent of the taxi-hailing market share. The giveaway is expected to hit Uber Technologies Inc. and Yidao Yongche, two other companies competing for the estimated $1 trillion-a-year market for transportation services in the world’s most populous country. China’s car-hailing industry is currently dominated by Didi and Kuaidi, which together account for a combined 78 percent of ride bookings, with Uber a distant third at 11 percent, according to Analysys International, an industry researcher. “Three years from now, our goal is to allow everyone to hail a taxi or get a ride within three minutes and to serve 30 million people per day,” Cheng Wei, chief executive officer of Didi Kuaidi, said in a statement. The company hopes to meet the demand by supplying more cars in a more flexible way, he said in the statement. Starting May 25, commuters in 12 Chinese cities will enjoy free rides for Didi Kuaidi’s chauffeur service every Monday for a month, according to the company. Didi Kuaidi aims to create the largest “one-stop transportation platform” in the world, the company said. The goal is to cover commuting needs from hailing taxis through mobile apps, to carpooling and booking premium cars with chauffeurs, it said. Formed out of an alliance of two competing apps, the two former rivals had engaged in intense competition, giving out subsidies to drivers and riders, before agreeing to work together in February. Alibaba and Tencent own 10 percent and 13 percent, respectively, in the merged company. Didi Kuaidi won a breakthrough this month after Shanghai said it will include the company in a new taxi-booking platform, the first official recognition of mobile-booking apps. The company is in talks with more local governments about cooperating on car-hailing services, Cheng said, declining to name the cities. By contrast, local media reported Uber’s offices in Guangzhou in southern China were raided by local authorities.\\n\\n\\nEBay Plots European Growth With Click-and-Collect Expansion; Surplus Space at Supermarkets Adds to Opportunity:  EBay Inc. plans to expand its click-and-collect service in the U.K. and across Europe, after buyers on its site collected 1.5 million parcels from British store chain Argos in the first 18 months of the service. Click and collect is becoming “the dominant way that consumers want their online purchases to be fulfilled” in the U.K., EBay’s senior vice president for Europe Paul Todd said in an interview at Bloomberg’s London headquarters. EBay, based in San Jose, California, is looking at all kinds of partnerships to boost its presence, Todd said. The Argos service, covering about 750 stores across Britain, is used by about 160,000 EBay merchants. Click-and-collect services are booming in Europe as more shoppers choose to fetch their purchase from a store rather than risk missing a home delivery. More than half of online orders placed with John Lewis department stores in the U.K. last Christmas were picked up from a store. France’s Darty Plc said Thursday that 20 percent of all Web sales in the fourth quarter were collected, up from about 10 percent a year ago. Surplus space in U.K. supermarkets may be one avenue that the company explores to boost its collection capabilities. J Sainsbury Plc said this month that about a quarter of its stores will have some under-utilized space in the next five years. The need for grocers to fill that space presents a “huge opportunity” for EBay, Todd said.\\n\\n\\nTinder Gets Into Music by Offering Zedd\\'s New Album for $3.99: Tinder users who spot Zedd\\'s fake profile and \"swipe right\"—which indicates interest in someone—receive a link to download his new True Colors album for $3.99 (compared to $7.99 on iTunes or Google Play). The profile is also tied to a contest to win an autographed CD. It may be the initial foray for Tinder in terms of selling music, but it\\'s not the first time the red-hot dating app has linked up with music. Earlier this year, pop singer Jason Derulo created a profile to drive views of his YouTube music video. A Tinder rep confirmed to Adweek that the Zedd promo is not an actual ad—it\\'s a partnership that the dating app has been testing with a number of marketers, such as Twentieth Century Fox, E!, and New York\\'s Urban Mudder event on July 25. Bud Light was the first and only brand to run Tinder ads last month as part of its \"Whatever, USA\" campaign.\\n\\n\\nConsolidation in China\\'s online travel sector: Expedia gives up on China partner, sells off $671M majority stake in eLong: Ctrip, China’s top travel site, this afternoon announced it has taken a US$400 million stake in long-time arch-rival eLong. The deal, which closed today, was done by acquiring eLong shares from Expedia. Ctrip now has a 37.6 percent stake in its erstwhile rival. Expedia has sold off its entire 62.4 percent stake in eLong, worth US$671 million, by selling the remaining shares to three other buyers (Keystone Lodging Holdings, Plateno Group, and Luxuriant Holdings), the US-based company said today. As a result of this deal, Ctrip says that it and Expedia have agreed to cooperate with each other on “certain travel product offerings for specified geographic markets.” Expedia’s brief statement did not make clear why it’s exiting eLong. The huge Expedia sell-off marks a major sea-change in China’s highly competitive travel ecommerce sector. It seems to be a huge win for Ctrip, which has now tamed its closest competitor. That leaves Ctrip freer to focus on newer and fast-growing rivals such as Baidu-owned Qunar, Tuniu, and LY. Ctrip has US backing of its own in the form of Priceline, which owns about eight percent of the company.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

The service, which allows customers to check out from an online merchant without having to enter their username and password, launched publicly last fall on mobile devices then expanded to the web in April. One Touch was originally designed to improve the conversion rates for online transactions. On mobile in particular, consumers tend to abandon purchases simply because of the challenges associated with entering in their personal information payment card details on mobile’s small screen. PayPal’s move to counter this trend was OneTouch for Mobile, which allows a customer’s information to be stored and shared between supported apps. That means that customers would only have to enter their PayPal credentials for their first mobile purchase, but subsequent purchases could be made with just one tap. The system is currently being used by a number of merchants including Jane.com, ParkWhiz, StubHub, Threadless, Airbnb, Lyft and Munchery, for example. In April, PayPal announced that it would offer similar functionality to web-based merchants as well, which meant the product now had the potential to reach PayPal’s 165 million customers. Despite being an older player in the ever-changing payments industry where newer contenders including Stripe, and now Apple Pay, are finding their ways into mobile apps and online stores, PayPal’s payments business is still growing. The company reported its net total payment volume rose 18 percent to $61 billion, it said in April, and it added 3.6 million new accounts in the quarter. The company says that today, online and mobile shopping accounts for $2.5 trillion in annual retail sales, and PayPal processes nearly 12.5 million payments for its customers daily. The move towards digital payments over physical payments is also a factor in PayPal’s growth. It notes that a couple of years ago, half of transactions involved checks or cash, but in a couple years’ time, they’ll account for only 25 percent of transactions.\\n\\n\\nHP earnings: quarterly revenue $25.5B, down 7% Y/Y; earnings down too as company prepares for split; shares up 2.3% on asset sales: Hewlett-Packard, the computer and printer giant, reported continued declines in profit and sales on Thursday as it prepared to split into two companies later this year. HP, based in Palo Alto, Calif., said on Thursday that net income in the fiscal second quarter fell 21 percent to $1 billion, or 55 cents a share, from the same quarter a year earlier. Revenue fell 7 percent to $25.5 billion. Sales fell short of Wall Street analysts’ revenue expectations of $25.63 billion for the quarter, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. Excluding some items, the company reported a profit of 87 cents a share, beating analyst estimates on that same basis of 86 cents. The results give investors a progress report on Ms. Whitman’s plan to split HP into two companies: One will focus on enterprise-computing technologies like servers, and the other will sell products like personal computers and printers. The separation is set to happen at the end of October. HP said the split remained on track and would initially incur operations costs of $400 million to $450 million. The two independent companies will each be large enough to enter the Fortune 500 and may be better able to react quickly to changing markets than within a large organization. Yet investors question whether the split will slow HP’s product creation and sales, as assets and roles are allocated, and whether competitors will exploit customer confusion to seize market share. Since announcing the plan to split, HP has reported declining profit. In March, the company sharply lowered its outlook for annual earnings. In anticipation of the separation, HP is shedding some assets. The company said on Thursday that it sold a 51 percent stake in its Chinese network business to Tsinghua University for about $2.3 billion. The move lets HP continue to sell equipment to businesses in China, which face government restrictions on use of foreign technologies. Shares were up 2.3%.\\n\\n\\nTwo IPOs: Shopify pops 69%, Alibaba-backed Baozun\\'s shares gyrate after overly aggressive IPO pricing: Canadian software maker Shopify valued at $2 billion in U.S. debut: Canadian e-commerce software maker Shopify Inc\\'s (SHOP.N) (SH.TO) shares rose as much as 69 percent in their U.S. debut, valuing the company at about $2.14 billion. Shopify, which also debuted on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday, is the first Canadian company to be listed on a U.S. exchange this year. Alibaba-backed Baozun\\'s shares seesaw in choppy debut: Shares of China\\'s Baozun Inc, in which Alibaba holds a nearly 20 percent stake, traded erratically in their debut on Thursday, sending the e-commerce services company\\'s valuation seesawing. The company\\'s American Depository Shares (ADSs) touched a high of $11.28, valuing it at $548.3 million, before reversing course all the way down to $9.23 per ADS. The 11 million ADSs offered were priced at $10 each, well below the $12-$14 range initially set by the underwriters. \"They priced it too aggressively,\" Francis Gaskins, president of IPO research firm IPOpremium.com said, adding that at the midpoint of the initial range, the shares would have been valued at 500 times annual earnings. Baozun provides website design, digital marketing and logistics services for retailers and brands hopping onto China\\'s e-commerce bandwagon. It counts Haagen Dazs, Nike, Guess and Microsoft among its more than 100 clients that are competing fiercely in China\\'s thriving online market, dominated by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  Alibaba\\'s investment arm is Baozun\\'s top shareholder, with an 18.2 percent stake. The company, which raised $110 million from the IPO, falling well short of its initial $129 million target, said it intended to split the proceeds between improving existing operations and making acquisitions. The company reported a net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of about $25.1 million and total net revenues of about $255.4 million last year.\\n\\n\\nNew patent lawsuits are down for the first time in five years on tighter patent processes. For months, Congress has moved steadily toward a bill that targets patent trolls — companies that own patents but don\\'t make any products with them. The problem, critics say, is that the patent holders will sue innocent companies in hopes they\\'ll simply settle for a bunch of cash. But even as firms like Etsy and Kickstarter hit Capitol Hill this week to press the case against abusive patent lawsuits, a new study shows that the pace of litigation has actually slipped — for the first time in five years. This is a big deal for a whole range of industries, not just the tech sector. It\\'s happening at a time when the spotlight on frivolous patent lawsuits has never been brighter. And that makes it a surprising find. You can see that in 2014, there was a sharp drop in the number of new patent cases. There were about 5,700 filed last year, according to PwC. That might sound like a lot, but it\\'s actually a 13 percent drop from the year before. We haven\\'t seen anything like this since 2009 — which is about when many companies started getting hit with their first demand letters. The letters are often vague about which patents have allegedly been infringed, leading to confusion and fear among the victims about what they may have done wrong. They can fight the suit and go to court, but defending a case is costly and unaffordable for many companies. The congressional legislation being debated would try to address some of these issues. But here\\'s what else could wind up curtailing patent litigation: The Supreme Court. According to PwC, the sharp decline in new patent lawsuits can be traced almost directly to the outcome of a major case last year known as Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank. Most analysts at the time said that Alice didn\\'t matter much. The Court ruled that the software patent Alice Corp. used to sue CLS didn\\'t pass the smell test. That much was obvious to many people watching the case; what they really wanted from the Court decision was a more concrete outline as to what kinds of software patent were patentable. But the fact that Alice put some limits on software patents at all appears to have put major pressure on those who are considering bringing a patent lawsuit, said PwC.Alice effectively \"raised the bar for patentability and enforcement of software patents,\" PwC\\'s report reads.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAPI-for-payments Startup Stripe In Talks For Up To $500 Million In New Funding That Could Value the Firm at $5B: Stripe is raising a new round of funding, according to sources with knowledge of the talks. One source with direct knowledge of the talks tells us that one of the leading investors in the deal is Yuri Milner’s DST Global. While all sources maintained that the round was “big,” there wasn’t a consensus on how much Stripe is looking to raise. The aforementioned source said that the round could be as big as $500 million and another source said the financing round would raise Stripe’s valuation to $5 billion. A Stripe spokesperson declined to comment on rumors and speculation. Stripe has seen rapid growth and is known for being very developer-friendly, having impeccable customer service, and being easy to implement. Processing payments can be quite a headache for young startups, and Stripe tries to make the process as easy as possible so that they can focus on what’s important: building a company. So far, the company has raised $190 million from some high-profile investors, including PayPal cofounders Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, Box CEO Aaron Levie, Khosla Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, and Sequoia Capital. Stripe has been adding products and high-profile partners over the past year as it expands across the globe. Earlier this week, Stripe announced a private beta program for Japan, and there are rumors that the company is looking to move to Singapore as well. It also added a new product called Stripe Connect to help marketplace companies — like Lyft, which needs to accept payments from customers and send payments to drivers —and partnered with Twitter and Facebook to power the respective companies Buy buttons. Stripe also inked a deal to support AliPay, which might be coming to the US soon. The fundraising round could be used to further spur global expansion. Milner has invested in social media giants Facebook and Twitter, and more recently turned his focus to international e-commerce and marketplace companies, like FlipKart and Ola Cabs. International expansion costs money — Stripe currently operates in 20 countries, while competitors like Braintree support worldwide coverage. That being said, Stripe will be facing some increased competition from an independent PayPal when the latter spins off from parent company eBay sometime during the Q3 of this year. PayPal acquired payment processor Braintree in 2013 for $800 million, which has some big clients, like Uber and Hotel Tonight, and launched v.zero, a new payment API to help developers. Smaller competitors are itching to go abroad as well — WePay raised $40 million to expand marketplace payment processing across the globe.\\n\\n\\nSpotify Takes on Apple and YouTube: to start offering videos:  Spotify just laid out its plans to be more than a streaming music service, moving to add videos and podcasts in a new service that will now be available in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Sweden. The changes chart a path that puts Spotify into direct competition with YouTube at a time when Apple is planning to relaunch its own streaming service.  Spotify touted a wide roster of content partners that include Comedy Central, Vice News, NBC, ABC, ESPN, and MTV The focus is on short clips. Digital video is a much bigger business than streaming music. Subscription revenue from audio service will top $5 billion in 2020, according to Generator Research, and by that date 100 million users will be paying for streaming music. This year, however, advertisers are already set to spend $7.8 billion on digital video, according to market research firm EMarketer.  By adding video, Spotify is asking users to interact with its service in a new way: Stare at the app on your phones; don\\'t just press play and stick it back in your pocket. Podcasts are an easier connection. While the podcasting industry can hardly match the financial heft of online video, it is having a bit of a moment. Spotify is launching with a number of high-profile partners in podcasting and radio. Slate, Radiolab, and American Public Media have all signed on. Spotify will also offer some original programming in both video and audio, including radio shows hosted by the rap group Odd Future, a video series showing a new dance move each day, and a podcast about new music. Spotify is taking a cue from Songza, an online radio startup acquired by Google last June, and will offer playlists that correspond to specific moods or activities (such as “chill” or “travel”). The company also announced a new feature that will use the sensors in a user’s phone to determine their pace when they’re out on a jog and then play music with beats that complement the workout.  The timing of Spotify’s announcement isn\\'t an accident. Next month Apple is expected to unveil its own streaming service built on its $3 billion acquisition of Beats. Sure, Spotify faces plenty of competitors already, but it hasn’t faced a serious rival since it broke away from the streaming music pack several years ago.  Apple is hardly guaranteed success. It launched a music-based streaming service, Ping, which failed. Then it tried a Pandora competitor, iTunes Radio, which has been underwhelming. Nor is it clear how Apple can fundamentally improve on music subscription services that are a pretty good deal for serious music fans. “Subscription music is a good category. There really isn’t a problem here for Apple to fix,” says Andrew Sheehy of Generator. “The only actual advantage that Apple has is the install base and its market power.” \\n\\n\\nCanadian eCommerce software maker Shopify valued at $1.27 billion at IPO price: Canadian e-commerce software maker Shopify Inc said its U.S. initial public offering was priced at $17 per share, valuing the company at about $1.27 billion. The company\\'s IPO of 7.7 million class A subordinate shares raised about $131 million, after it was priced above the top end of the expected range of $14-$16. The offering was earlier expected to be priced at $12-$14. The company sold all the shares in the offering. \"Pricing reflects big enthusiasm for these type of deals. It\\'s a unique company in a hot area with lots of growth,\" said Josef Schuster, founder of IPO investment firm IPOX Schuster LLC. \"There\\'s going to be a big pop coming tomorrow.\" Ottawa-based Shopify, which is also expected to debut on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday, makes software that helps small and medium-sized retailers to set up online storefronts. Shopify charges a monthly subscription fees of $29-$179. The company has also created online stores for a variety of retailers ranging from tattoo companies to fashion boutiques and vintage book sellers. Shopify said 162,261 merchants had subscribed to its platform from about 150 countries as of March 31. Shopify\\'s biggest investors are venture capital firms Bessemer Venture Partners, with a 30 percent stake, and FirstMark Capital LP, which has a nearly 12 percent stake.\\n\\n\\nCinematic Pins: Pinterest has launched a new ad format - a new kind of Promoted Pin—one that is animated. The ad updates come more than a year after Pinterest first started selling Promoted Pins, and the changes are a big step for its ad technology. Brands will be able to target about a dozen audience types from foodies to gardening enthusiasts to millennials. The new animated ads are called Cinematic Pins, and they are a bit different from the moving ads developed by rivals like Facebook and Twitter. On those platforms, videos start when you stop scrolling over them and stop when you scroll away. On Pinterest, the opposite happens. The Cinematic Pins are seen in motion as the user scrolls, but the motion stops when the scrolling stops. \"Users want to feel like they\\'re in control, and we\\'ve done a bunch of user testing—users are delighted by this experience,\" said Tim Kendall, Pinterest\\'s gm of monetization. \"They wind up scrolling back and forth. They love controlling the motion.\" A number of brands already have tested the feature, including Unilever, The Gap, L\\'Oreal, Nestlé, Walgreens, Target, Visa and Wendy\\'s. The Cinematic Pins and audience targeting are part of Pinterest\\'s new three-stage advertising offering that starts with awareness marketing. The advertisers pay on a cost-per-thousand-view basis. Then there\\'s a marketing model based on consumer intent—when they\\'re still deciding on a potential purchase. This type of marketing lets brands buy ads based on a cost-per-click or cost-per-engagement basis—they pay when users click on or share a Promoted Pin. In the third phase, ads are sold on a cost-per-action basis when an app is installed or a sale completed. \"We only want them to pay us when the ads create that value,\" Kendall said. \"It takes the risk out of it for marketers.\" Kendall said Pinterest is showing brands impressive engagement rates—for every 100 Promoted Pin impressions, brands see 30 free views thanks to repinning. \"That\\'s a really high rate of earned media,\" he said. Pinterest does not say how much revenue it generates in ad sales annually, and it still is a private company. But, it gets about 76 million monthly visitors, according to comScore. The platform, which lets people curate digital pin boards for projects and wish lists, is seen as an accurate marketing window into consumer behavior.\\n\\n\\nSalesforce Earnings: Quarterly Revenue $1.5B, +23% Y/Y Despite Dollar Strength: Shares Up 3%: Salesforce today reported adjusted profit of $0.16 per share on revenue if $1.51 billion in the first quarter of its fiscal 2016. The market had expected the SaaS firm to report $0.14 in adjusted, per-share profit on revenue of $1.5 billion. Shares of Salesforce are up around 3 percent in after-hours trading, a gain that is tempered by the firm’s 1.85 percent decline in regular trading. For the current quarter, the second of its fiscal 2016, Salesforce expects revenue of $1.59 billion, generating adjusted profit of between $0.17 and $0.18.  A $7 billion run rate implies fourth-quarter revenue of $1.75 billion, or around $250 million more than in the now-past period. Salesforce’s revenue grew 23 percent in its most recent quarter. For the full fiscal year, Salesforce expects revenue of between $6.52 billion, and $6.55 billion, numbers that it calculates to include $175 million to $200 million in “FX headwind.” In short, the company is taking a hit, as is nearly every U.S.-based tech shop that sells abroad. The strong dollar can hurt revenue growth, given that top-line earned overseas converts more weakly into dollars.  All told, it seems that Salesforce is on solid footing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYahoo shares fall as Marissa Mayer’s plan to spin off Yahoo’s $34 billion stake in Alibaba tax-free could run into resistance from federal tax authorities. An official from the Internal Revenue Service told tax lawyers in Washington on Tuesday that the agency was weighing potential changes to how it treats some kinds of tax-free spinoffs. The I.R.S. is particularly concerned about spinoffs in which the operating business comprises only a small portion of the new publicly traded company, according to the official. That is exactly the type of spinoff that Ms. Mayer, chief executive of Yahoo, proposed in January. The Internet company intends to bundle its small-business services division with its 384 million shares of Alibaba into a new company and spin it off to Yahoo shareholders later this year. As reports of the I.R.S. review circulated on Tuesday in the last half-hour of trading, Yahoo shares plunged, closing at $40.98, down 7.6 percent. More than half of the company’s stock market valuation is based on its stake in Alibaba. Robert Peck, an Internet stock analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, said it was unclear whether any change in the government’s tax treatment of spinoffs would affect transactions already in the works, such as the Yahoo-Alibaba transaction. “It’s very ambiguous,” he said. “Does it apply to current deals they are looking at, or future deals only?” If Yahoo’s disposal of Alibaba were fully taxed, Mr. Peck estimated that the fair value for Yahoo’s stock would be about $40 a share, or roughly the current level. If the spinoff remains tax-free as Yahoo envisioned it, then Yahoo shares are worth closer to $55, he said. Currently, a spinoff must include an operating business, not just assets like stock, to qualify as a tax-free transaction. The I.R.S. has not established firm guidelines about how important the operating business must be to the spinoff company. Yahoo Small Business, the operating unit that Yahoo is proposing to include with the Alibaba stake, is a strong business that never fit well with the rest of Yahoo’s portfolio, according to Amit Kumar, who ran the unit until last November. “The profitability and revenue profile were surprisingly strong, compared to many other businesses at Yahoo,” he said. “But certainly by the fact that Yahoo chose Yahoo Small Business as the division to spin off, they don’t consider it a core business.”\\n\\n\\nGoogle Search Now Shows Tweets, but Will It Help Twitter Get More Users? Tweets have begun to show up in Google search results, and Twitter\\'s stock is up a bit. Probably not a coincidence. Investors hope this deal will help the company capture a broader audience, and turn the casual onlookers, who may stumble upon a tweet while browsing the Web, into active members. While Google is giving Twitter a nice billboard for its content, the experience leaves something to be desired. The full body of the tweet, including a photo if there is one, lives on the search page. Clicking one brings you to Twitter\\'s site, which includes the same information, along with the number of retweets and favorites the post has received. (If you\\'re not a Twitter user, do these numbers even mean anything to you?) Above that, for nonmembers, are giant buttons that say “Sign Up” and “Log In.” Hit just about any other button on the page, and you get a popup that implores you, again, to please, please sign up for Twitter. As the company struggles to add users at the rate it used to, a key part of Twitter\\'s strategy involves drawing people in from around the Web. Twitter has been working on the experience for logged-out users on desktop computers, adding a new homepage that allows people to browse tweets about certain subjects, like Nascar or cute animals. James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., says the Google deal shows Twitter isn\\'t there yet on mobile. With the current implementation, Twitter runs the risk of drawing people to click on tweets, only to repel them with desperate pleas to sign up or log in for more, he says. “The experience is pretty cool in the search results, but that does not necessarily correlate to engagement, monetization, and conversion,” Cakmak says. “There is nothing on mobile to drive eyeballs to. The logged-out experience is barely figured out on desktop, and they\\'ve been working on it since November.”\\n\\n\\nEtsy Plunges 13% After Reporting Its First-Quarter Financial Performance: Shares of Etsy ,the online marketplace for handmade goods which IPO-ed in April, plunged today after the company reported roughly in-line revenue and a wider-than-expected loss. Etsy, a popular marketplace for handmade goods, reported top line of $58.5 million, ahead of expectations of $58 million. However, the company lost $36.6 million in the quarter, or $0.84 per share. In the year-ago quarter, Etsy had a far-smaller $463,000 loss. Etsy is off over 13 percent in after-hours trading as of the time of writing. The company’s revenue growth, compared to the year-ago quarter of 44.4 percent, greatly outpaces the expansion of sales on its platform, which posted a slimmer 28.2 percent rise. Investors may view that discrepancy as indicative of potentially deprecated revenue growth. Adding to the negative pressure is the company’s notes on its second — i.e. current — quarter, which indicated lower revenue growth, increased headcount and rising costs. Combined, you can spell that in the following way: margin pressure. Etsy’s operating expenses rose 72.6 percent compared to the year-ago quarter.\\n\\n\\nAutodesk earnings: revenue $646M, +9.1% Y/Y;  shares fall 8% in extended trading. Autodesk  which makes computer-aided design software, forecast lower-than-expected profit and revenue for the second quarter, citing a stronger dollar. Autodesk, known for its AutoCAD software used by construction companies, engineers and manufacturers to design products and simulate real-world performance, now expects revenue growth of 2-4 percent for the year. The company had earlier forecast a 3-5 percent growth. Shares of the company, which also cut its profit and revenue forecast for the year, fell nearly 8 percent in extended trading on Tuesday. Autodesk, which gets nearly two-thirds of its revenue from outside the Americas, projected currency rate fluctuations to hit revenue growth by 5 percentage points for the year ending January 31. Revenue increased to 9.1 percent $646.5 million. The company, which is moving from a license-based business to a cloud-based subscription model, said subscription revenue rose 15.7 percent to $319.8 million. Subscriptions bring in less money upfront, as payment is spread over the entire period of use unlike traditional packaged software, but typically ensure more predictable recurring revenue. The switch to the new model increased Autodesk\\'s costs. While total cost of revenue increased 16.6 percent, total operating expenses went up 13.1 percent. The company\\'s net income fell to $19.1 million, or 8 cents per share, from $28.3 million, or 12 cents per share, a year earlier.\\n\\n\\nNo, Uber drivers can’t game the ‘surge pricing’ system as easily the way one driver claims: Uber\\'s \"surge pricing\" algorithm is both critical to its success and a huge proverbial target on the company\\'s back. It is, Uber says, supply and demand in its most basic form: When drivers are scarce, and demand is high, prices go up. That\\'s good for drivers who are now being paid less on the Uber base rate since the company began dropping prices to beat the competition and generate demand. And it can be good for those who are desperate for a ride — and are willing to pay. Critics say that surge pricing can result in truly absurd fares at peak times, and the company admitted making a misstep by allowing surge pricing to go into effect in the middle a natural disaster. Recently, a video, purportedly from an Uber driver, was published online claiming to show a strategy that Uber drivers can use to manipulate the system by inducing higher and higher surge fares. There\\'s no narration of what\\'s happening, but over the course of about three minutes, the \"driver\" demonstrates how to do this by accepting rides, then immediately canceling them. The person does this several times, and by the end of the video, surge pricing increases to 2.1 times the normal fare in some areas.  The video, titled \"Driving for surge,\" was initially posted publicly in April but has now been made private. The video was also posted in a thread on a message board for ride-share drivers last week by a user who was labeled on the message board as a \"well-known member.\" That person encouraged drivers to get \"on the surge bus\" and ride \"to profits together.\" The person who shared the video on the ride-sharing forum claimed that he has been \"doing this for months\" without hearing anything from Uber. It is unclear whether that is true, and Uber would not comment on the individual driver, who included his first name and license plate number in the video. Even if the strategy was plausible, it probably won\\'t work for long, as other drivers on the forum quickly pointed out. \"This is a terrible strategy. You\\'ll get deactivated within a week with that many trip cancellations,\" one driver commented. Surge pricing in an entire city, where there might be hundreds or thousands of drivers on the road, is unlikely to be affected by the actions of a single driver — or even a handful of drivers. Surge pricing kicks in when a lot of different users begin requesting rides and there aren\\'t enough drivers. Sure-fire predictors for surge pricing: bad weather, rush hour or, perhaps, the time just before Sunday brunch. Because Uber monitors every ride, repeatedly canceling rides is really just a good way for a driver to trigger enhanced scrutiny.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWSJ\\'s Scoop: Google\\'s eCommerce play:  Company will launch buy buttons on its search-results pages in coming weeks.  Google Inc. will launch buy buttons on its search-result pages in coming weeks, a controversial step by the company toward becoming an online marketplace rivaling those run by Amazon.com Inc. and eBay Inc. The search giant will start showing the buttons when people search for products on mobile devices, according to people familiar with the matter.  The buy button will appear only on mobile phones (and currently only to a small percentage of mobile traffic). 1. It’s currently available only in the US. 2. Shoppers will input their credit card information with Google once, or can use a variety of digital payment methods (Google hasn’t clarified which ones yet). 3. Shoppers will have the option to choose different colors, sizes and shipping options. 4. Shoppers will have their email and address information shared with retailers, if they opt in. (This is important.) 5. The program will continue to be advertising-based, instead of commission-based, which is substantially different from Amazon, eBay, and other marketplaces. So what does this mean for retailers and brands? At ChannelAdvisor, we think this could be big news — one of the biggest disruptions since Google launched Product Listing Ads (PLAs) — and something all retailers and brands need to watch closely. Our experience shows that early adopters of PLAs gained an early and sustainable lead, and we think this change has the potential to further separate the leaders from the laggards. So it makes a ton of sense to us at ChannelAdvisor that Google may be launching its own version of a marketplace by way of a buy button — think of it as a “transactional ad unit.” In fact, given Google’s assets — from Android to Google Wallet to PLAs and everything in between — it’s actually a bit of a surprise to us that this hasn’t happened sooner. Our verdict? This development could be huge for retailers, and those that get on the bus early are likely to widen the competitive gap between themselves and their competitors.\\n\\n\\nJust Dial integrates e-commerce marketplace with its local business listings platform. Just Dial Ltd, which runs an India-specific local business listing platform Justdial.com, has expanded the scope of its B2C transaction based services by adding product e-commerce marketplace. The firm had started what it called ‘search plus’ or transaction services where it allowed people to order food online from local restaurants, book doctor’s appointment and flight tickets and much more. With product e-commerce it is now entering a much wider market which can add to its revenue stream. The company has added a ‘shop online’ feature on the homepage where it lists products across several categories such as mobile, appliances, electronics besides a host of others including those which are not pushed by big e-commerce marketplaces such as tiles, sanitaryware, bicycle, paints etc. Since it is a marketplace it essentially connects consumers to third party vendors and only acts as a platform linking the buyer and sellers while facilitating the transaction. In the process it comes across as another hyper local e-commerce platform which links local shops to consumers online. This makes sense for Just Dial as it extends the offering by allowing those local sellers already listed on its platform to sell products. Few weeks ago restaurant listing site Zomato started online ordering of food from its restaurant partners in a similar move to extend an existing business line. However, how seriously the consumer would absorb the Just Dial offering given there are specialised e-commerce ventures doing a similar job with better UI/UX, is something we would get to know as Just Dial starts sharing user stats, from next quarter. One area of differentiator could be its delivery promise. The site claims some products like grocery and medicine ordered through its platform will be delivered in an hour while for some others like electronics, Just Dial says it offers a ‘7-hour express delivery’ for orders placed before 2 PM and the offer comes with Just Dial’s written guarantee along with manufacturer’s warranty & original invoice. Orders post 2 PM will be delivered in the next 24 hours. Although most large e-commerce properties also offer same day delivery for some products, since Just Dial primarily leverages local sellers, it can actually cut down on delivery timelines. It would compete with several players such as Flipkart, Amazon, Snapdeal, ShopClues and Paytm. Indeed Paytm appears to be the closest peer to Just Dial in terms of the e-commerce business model. Others offer warehousing and even logistics services to their vendors.\\n\\n\\nPeople Changes at Tiger Global. Tiger Global Management on Monday announced key personnel changes including the departure of Feroz Dewan, who has run the closely watched Wall Street firm\\'s hedge fund operations and is leaving to start his own business. Dewan, a partner who has been with Tiger Global for 12 years, will leave at the end of June, the firm\\'s founder, Chase Coleman, wrote to clients in a letter seen by Reuters. Tiger Global oversees roughly $20 billion in assets, with roughly half invested in its fast-growing private equity business. The remainder is invested in public equities with about $6 billion in its hedge fund and $3.5 billion in its long-only portfolios. Scott Shleifer, who had been running the private equity business with Lee Fixel, will take over as head of the firm\\'s public equity business. Tiger Global has long been focused on technology investing and listed Chinese e-commerce company JD.com Inc as its biggest holding at the end of the first quarter. It also raised its stake in Alibaba Group Holding Co , which listed its shares in the biggest ever initial public offering last year, a regulatory filing shows. The hedge fund started the year on a rocky note but recovered some ground in April with a 3.2 percent gain, leaving it down 2.4 percent for the year to date, an investor said. Separately, Caleb Watts, also a Tiger Global partner, also will be leaving to focus on managing his own money, according to the letter. To streamline operations the firm is also merging its Tiger Global Internet Opportunities Fund into its Tiger Global Long Opportunities fund.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba-backed Visualead rolls out new dotless QR codes that aim to reduce counterfeiting. In January, Alibaba disclosed its investment in Visualead, an Israeli startup that helps brands make colorful, visually appealing QR codes. While the company’s product was cute, its value to Alibaba is growing clearer now that it has revealed a new QR code alternative that aims to prevent counterfeit sales. Alibaba is using Visualead’s technology to power Blue Star, a new tool that prints out individual, scannable codes for individual packages. When scanned using the mobile app for Taobao, an image appears confirming (or denying) the product’s authenticity. Brands can choose from a set number of templates to customize these landing images and throw in links to promotions or e-commerce pages… perhaps even ones that are on an Alibaba property. Visualead co-founder and CEO Nevo Alva tells Tech in Asia that Alibaba only opens Blue Star to genuine brands. That means Nike can sign up, but FakeNikes.com will get turned away. Alva also adds that Alibaba is providing Blue Star free-of-charge for the time being, irrespective of where the goods will be sold. That means that Nike can pin the codes to packages that will go to an Alibaba competitor.\\n\\n\\nSpotify Inks Deal With Starbucks Tasking Customers With Picking In-Store Music. Spotify and Starbucks just announced a clever deal to promote Spotify Premium while giving Starbuck customers and employees the opportunity to influence the music played at their local Starbucks. This is the latest in a line of high-profile deals Spotify bagged that puts its brand in front of an important consumer demographic. Soon baristas will be tasked with making coffee and picking the music in their locations. The deal links Starbucks’ loyalty program with Spotify’s massive music ecosystem, giving My Starbucks Reward members unique access to Spotify. Program users will then be able to influence which songs makes it on in-store playlists. The program starts with 150,000 U.S.-based Starbucks store employees who will receive a Spotify Premium membership in the fall. The plan is then to roll out the service to Starbucks customers shortly after. Streaming music companies such as Spotify, Rdio and others are racing to differentiate themselves. Since most platforms offer similar music and experiences, the war is mostly in public relations. And Spotify is winning this part of the war signing deals to allow Uber riders to DJ from the backseat and getting the streaming service into BMW and Mini cars. Starbucks has long associated itself with emerging music and this deal with Spotify pushes the coffee retailer (along with its legions of dedicated customers) into the age of streaming media.\\n\\n\\nSingapore’s Postal Service Reinvents for the Digital Age, Derives a Quarter of its Revenue from eCommerce: With traditional mail services in decline, post offices around the world are scrambling to reinvent themselves for the digital age. “Sitting on that burning platform, we looked around and said, ‘Where could we develop?’” said Wolfgang Baier, the chief executive of SingPost. Japan Post is buying the largest private package and freight delivery company in Australia, Toll Holdings, in a bid to create a rival to UPS and FedEx. The United States Postal Service, which lost $5.5 billion last year, is providing Sunday deliveries for Amazon. Australia Post is working with the Chinese Internet giant Alibaba to help local businesses connect with consumers in China. There are at least two business trends unfolding before us. One is the death of mail,” said Frank Lavin, chief executive of the e-commerce consultancy Export Now. “The second is this boom in e-commerce.” SingPost’s makeover is among the most ambitious. Besides its regular postal duties, it offers a basket of services for companies, including website development, online marketing, customer service and, of course, package delivery. Following the Amazon model, it is building a network of 24 warehouses in 12 countries to stockpile goods for companies. The e-commerce team is staffed with former Silicon Valley executives. Singapore’s central location, said Mr. Baier, makes it a natural hub for e-commerce in Asia. He recited numbers to demonstrate the scale of the opportunity: Over 600 million consumers live in the region around Singapore, and 2.2 billion people are within a five-hour flight. The shift has been stark for the postal service, once a state-owned company that went public in 2003. Four years ago, e-commerce barely figured into its bottom line. Today, it accounts for more than a quarter of the group’s revenues, which have grown by 60 percent during that same period. Others are taking notice. Last year, Alibaba paid $250 million for a 10 percent stake in SingPost. Alibaba and SingPost are now in discussions to form a joint venture focused on e-commerce logistics in Southeast Asia. Then, two years ago, SingPost made its biggest digital push, creating SP eCommerce to tap into the Internet retail boom in Asia. Today, it counts nearly 1,000 companies as clients, including Philips, Uniqlo, Deckers and Muji. SP eCommerce’s offices feel more start-up than mailroom. There is a Foosball table in one corner. Employees can play Ping-Pong. The group’s chief executive, Marcelo Wesseler, created his first e-commerce website in 1997 and worked in Silicon Valley before moving to Singapore. Other employees have come from technology stalwarts like Amazon and Hewlett-Packard. The company also created a customer-care department. At its Singapore offices, 30 or so employees handle the phones, answering questions or addressing complaints. An additional 200 customer-service agents work elsewhere. As part of the e-commerce expansion, SingPost upgraded its core delivery services. It has bolstered its network of warehouses and fulfillment centers, most of which are in Asia. The centers handle freight and customs clearance so goods can move faster through the region, where regulations differ from country to country. In Singapore, SingPost has invested $182 million in building a high-tech warehouse that will merge logistics and sorting into one assembly line. Workers punch or scan an order on a screen, and robotic trays deliver products from shelves for them to pack and ship. SingPost is pitching itself as a conduit to the Asian consumer, particularly in countries like Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia. With its swelling population of young and mobile consumers with newly disposable incomes, the region offers a rich seam of new opportunities. Looking beyond its borders for growth, the Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi last year opened a regional headquarters in Singapore, using it as a launching pad to move into Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia. Next, it is targeting Vietnam and Thailand. It teamed up with SingPost for support on logistics for e-commerce, which accounts for 80 percent of Xiaomi’s sales in Southeast Asia. At its campus in Singapore, SingPost built a warehouse specially for Xiaomi, where orders from the first click to the final delivery are handled. Inside the 11,000-square-foot space, a smartphone battery is stuffed into a cardboard box, sent flying down a green conveyor belt and zipped off to the customer a few miles away. A video camera is perched above, controlled by someone who watches from Beijing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba sued in U.S. by luxury brands over counterfeit goods:\\xa0A group of luxury goods makers sued Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) on Friday, contending the Chinese online shopping giant had knowingly made it possible for counterfeiters to sell their products throughout the world. The lawsuit was filed in Manhattan federal court by Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and other brands owned by Paris-based Kering seeking damages and an injunction for alleged violations of trademark and racketeering laws. The lawsuit alleged that Alibaba had conspired to manufacture, offer for sale and traffic in counterfeit products bearing their trademarks without their permission. Friday\\'s lawsuit marked the second time in less than a year that the Kering brands had sued Alibaba over the alleged sale of counterfeit products. An earlier lawsuit was filed in July only to be withdrawn the same month with the ability to refile it while the Kering units worked toward a resolution with Alibaba, according to court records. The lawsuit alleged that Alibaba and its related entities \"provide the marketplace advertising and other essential services necessary for counterfeiters to sell their counterfeit products to customers in the United States.\" The lawsuit cited, for example, an alleged fake Gucci bag offered for $2 to $5 each by a Chinese merchant to buyers seeking at least 2,000 units. The authentic Gucci bag retails for $795, the complaint said. Alibaba has allowed for counterfeit sales to continue even when it had been expressly informed that merchants were selling fake products, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit seeks a court order that, among other things, would block Alibaba from offering or facilitating the sale of counterfeit products and unspecified damages that could include $2 per counterfeit item under a statutory regime.\\n\\n\\nUS E-Commerce Sales Are Surging - Call it the Amazon effect:\\xa0Sales on e-commerce websites increased 3.5 percent in the first three months of the year from the previous quarter, reaching a record $80 billion worth of purchases, according to seasonally-adjusted figures released by the Commerce Department on Friday. Meanwhile, total retail sales declined 1.5 percent, the first quarterly drop in almost three years. On a year-over-year basis, online purchases soared a whopping 14.5 percent, compared with a 1.6 percent increase for total sales. While 7 percent might sound like just a sliver of the market, remember that there are still a lot of things you wouldn\\'t think of buying online, such as gasoline, cars and restaurant meals. Within certain categories, such as apparel, the shift to the Internet has been faster, according to Poonam Goyal, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. \"Companies that generate the largest portion of their sales from online are apparel stores,\" Goyal said. \"Their online sales are often more than 15 percent of their total sales, so the potential there is enormous.”\\n\\n\\nNetflix Shares at All-Time High, Said to be in Talks to Enter China in partnership with Alibaba investee Wasu:\\xa0Netflix Inc. rose above $600 a share for the first time after it was reported to be in talks with a Chinese media company backed by Jack Ma and other possible partners as it seeks entry into China’s $5.9 billion online video market. Netflix has held discussions with companies including Wasu Media Holding Co., according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. Netflix plans “to be nearly global by the end of 2016,” Anne Marie Squeo, a spokeswoman, said in response to questions about a possible China partnership. Shares of Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, climbed 4.5 percent to close at $613.25 in New York. A local partnership would be essential given the Chinese government’s strict controls over licensing for online content. Netflix wants a partner that has licenses for content on all devices -- including mobile phones, computers and set-top boxes, according to the people. China’s State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television has given Internet TV licenses to seven companies, including Wasu. Netflix would need to sort out content censorship regulations with Chinese authorities. Starting this April, new episodes of foreign programs -- including “Mad Men” and “The Simpsons” -- can’t be shown until after the shows’ seasons have ended, according to a government notice. Episodes need to handed in to censors for approval, and content deemed violent, sexual or offensive to the ruling Communist Party can be cut, according to notices. Wasu, one of the first companies in China to receive an Internet TV license from the government, has been working with Ma’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to produce set-top boxes since 2013. Wasu operates cable TV and broadband networks in Hangzhou, where Alibaba is based. Wasu said in April last year it would sell a 20 percent stake to Alibaba Chairman Ma and fellow billionaire Shi Yuzhu.\\n\\n\\nLyft raises $150M at valuation of $2.5B; Carl Icahn invests $100M:\\xa0Lyft Inc. raised an additional $150 million, led by an investment of $100 million from billionaire Carl Icahn, raising the stakes in the car-hailing service’s rivalry with Uber Technologies Inc. The fundraising will help Lyft in a battle for market share with the much larger Uber. A Lyft presentation to investors that was obtained by Bloomberg News in April showed mounting costs for marketing the service. Lyft projects a 512 percent jump in net revenue this year to $796 million. Lyft’s other investors include Japan’s Rakuten, China’s Alibaba and the Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. The San Francisco-based company had a fourfold increase in active passengers on 2.2 million rides in December 2014 but growth was beginning to slow, the presentation for investors said. The document was prepared for a $530 million fundraising round announced in March that valued the company at about $2.5 billion.\\n\\n\\nTaiwan orders Alibaba\\'s Taobao out for rule violation:\\xa0Taiwan has ordered Alibaba\\'s online marketplace Taobao to withdraw from the island within six months for violating investment rules required for a Chinese company, Chinese and Taiwanese media said on Thursday. Taobao has been fined T$240,000 ($7,860) and must withdraw or transfer its holdings from its operation in Taiwan, China\\'s Xinhua news agency and Taiwan\\'s Economic Daily News quoted the island\\'s investment commission as saying. Taobao and the commission could not immediately be reached for comment. The commission falls under the Ministry of Economic Affairs and has authority to regulate Chinese investments in Taiwan. In March, Alibaba\\'s B2B platform Alibaba.com was ordered to leave the island within six months and fined T$120,000 for a similar reason. Chinese investments in Taiwan are regulated strictly because Taiwan considers mainland China a political rival, even though trade and economic ties have expanded markedly since the late 2000s.\\n\\n\\nA Look at the Business Model of\\xa0Kijiji, a Flop in the US, but which Rules Online Classifieds in Canada:\\xa0More than 12 million people visit Kijiji’s site in Canada every month, three times the amount drawn to Craigslist in the country. The service is used by 42 percent of Canadians, according to comScore, making it one of country’s 10 most popular sites. It has also eclipsed other companies’ online businesses, including Cox Automotive’s once dominant used-car site, AutoTrader. That success is a striking counterexample to the globalization of the web, in which services like Facebook and Google offer a single product worldwide. It also represents one of the few online brands that fizzled in the United States but found success elsewhere, as the social media pioneer Friendster has in the Philippines and Malaysia. Four years earlier, Ms. Bannister joined eBay in California and became director of category development, working to expand the online auction site beyond its original niche of collectible trinkets. When she returned to Canada, as director of product, she was put in charge of the features in the Canadian version of eBay. She soon found that the operation had a significant problem. “EBay Canada was doing a very good job of getting people in Canada to the website, but we were doing a terrible job actually getting them to transact on the website,” said Ms. Bannister, who is now a general partner at Real Ventures, a seed capital investment fund. “We did some things on the website to try to address it, but it didn’t really close the gap.” A fundamental problem for eBay in Canada, Mr. Shiau said, is that Canadians generally do not like auction-based pricing. On top of that, Ms. Bannister found that because Canada’s vast geography and low population density make shipping costs high and delivery times long, buyers of secondhand goods preferred to make deals in person. To Ms. Bannister, the answer for eBay seemed to be online classified ads. At the head office, however, the idea did not appear to be quite so obvious. At the time, about 10 percent of Canadians used Craigslist, a level many eBay executives thought meant that it was fully entrenched. Nevertheless, they gave Ms. Bannister some classifieds site software being developed for Europe along with a small amount of money to adapt the site and market the result. Listings swiftly grew. Making money, however, was a more gradual process. Among other things, the site did not even introduce banner advertising until it had become fully established. Today, Kijiji has three revenue sources. In addition to banner ads, the site sells more prominent positions within results and more elaborate displays for ads like photo galleries. Also, car dealers and housing rental companies pay subscription fees for their listings. Despite those fees, the autos section is hugely popular, with 4.6 million vehicles listed last year, said Scott Neil, managing director of Kijiji in Canada. This month, Kijiji attracted about 160 car dealers to an annual sales conference in Toronto. And in one measure of Kijiji’s success, Postmedia Network, the dominant newspaper publisher in most large Canadian cities, now uses the service to provide the used-car listings on its automotive websites.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon\\'s smart speaker Echo now can be used to place orders: Amazon Echo Can Now Do Some Of Your Shopping For You, Prime Members: Amazon’s Echo speaker/intelligent tube/listening pal revealed a bit more of its true nature today: It can now field voice-powered buying requests, translating your spoken desire for more paper towels into more actual paper towels, for instance. The catch is that it’s restricted to Prime members, it only works with Prime-eligible goods, and you need both a U.S. billing address and a U.S.-based payment method. To command your smart cylinder to conduct commerce on your behalf, all you need do is use your Wake word, then tell it to reorder whatever item you’re after. This is designed to be an easy way to order again things you’re often already buying rep eats of anyway, so ostensibly Amazon is positioning it as a convenience feature, not a full-fledged shopping alternative.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba to invest more abroad as globalization top priority: CEO Zhang Alibaba Group Holding Ltd will invest heavily in existing and new ventures abroad, making its push beyond the China market a top priority, the Chinese e-commerce leader\\'s new CEO, Daniel Zhang, said. Zhang\\'s comments come at a time when Alibaba aims to maintain its rapid growth even as the prospect of e-commerce saturation at home looms over the company. \"We must absolutely globalize,\" Zhang said in his first speech since taking up his new post this week, according to a report on Thursday on Alibaba\\'s news and commentary website, Alizila. The vast bulk of Alibaba\\'s revenue comes from its dominant domestic online marketplaces, but the company has been investing in a range of sectors abroad. Just this week it announced it would set up a cloud computing base in Dubai, and boosted its stake in U.S. e-retailer Zulily Inc. Zhang said if Alibaba does not globalize it won\\'t be able to last 100 years - a goal set out by Executive Chairman Jack Ma. In the three months ended March, Alibaba\\'s revenue from China commerce grew 39 percent to $2.2 billion. International commerce grew 27 percent to $264 million and only accounted for 9 percent of revenue, compared to 11 percent in the same period a year earlier. Alibaba says some of its larger overseas markets include Brazil and Russia. The company and its affiliates are also making overtures in India, where it is in talks with phone maker Micromax Informatics to buy a $1.2 billion stake, according to several people with direct knowledge of the matter.\\n\\n\\nPayPal to Trade Under Old Symbol PYPL After Split From EBay: PayPal, the payments division that’s separating from EBay Inc., will trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market as PYPL, its original ticker symbol before being acquired by the online marketplace in 2002. EBay announced the split last year after activist investor Carl Icahn said PayPal was being held back by its parent company’s slower-growing Web marketplace business. All of EBay Inc.’s 15 board members will remain with the company or become new board members of PayPal when it spins off from EBay in the third quarter. EBay Chairman Pierre Omidyar, who founded the online marketplace in 1995, will be a director for both companies, EBay said Thursday in a statement.\\n\\n\\nDeal Talks for \\'Here\\' Mapping Service Brings Spotlight to the Lucrative B2B Location Data Market: When people look up a company’s Facebook page on their smartphones, the address is overlaid on a digital map provided by Here, Nokia’s mapping unit, which is for sale. The same goes for the mapping services offered by Amazon and Yahoo. The tech giants are just three of the many companies, including SAP, Verizon Wireless and Baidu, the Chinese search engine,\\u200b that rely heavily on Nokia’s geospatial data. Companies are grappling to stay relevant in a world where smartphones — and people’s geographical information — are at the heart of nearly every tech leader’s plans. That is why companies like Uber, the ride-booking service, and an alliance of German automakers have submitted rival bids of up to $3 billion to acquire the Nokia division. A deal is widely expected by the end of the month. If one happens, there is likely to be a lot of angst to go around in the tech industry. Nokia’s mapping service is the main global competitor to Google Maps. But if a new owner decides to restrict access to Here’s vast, 30-year-old trove of mapping data, some of the largest tech companies could find themselves relying on Google’s mapping services once more. That could put companies like Amazon and Yahoo in a difficult position, potentially requiring them to share valuable location and routing data with one of their most powerful rivals in Silicon Valley. “There are too many businesses out there that want an independent service,” \\u200bsaid Harold \\u200bGoddijn, chief executive of TomTom, the Dutch digital mapping company that licenses data to Apple for its mapping service. \\u200b“They don\\u200b’\\u200bt want to share customer data with \\u200bGoogl\\u200be. \\u200bThey want users to stay within their domain.” As part of the German automakers’ bid, the companies, which include BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz, want to give access to Nokia’s mapping service, under licensing agreements, so others can still use its global geospatial data, according to a person who spoke on the condition of anonymity. It remains unclear whether Uber would follow suit if it acquired the unit. “Mapping is an extremely hard thing to do and takes years to replicate,” said Shyam Kumar, a senior analyst whose firm, TT Focus Fund, is an investor in both TomTom and Nokia. “If you cannot get access to another independent map, you might end up having to license from one of your major competitors. There’s obviously an inherent tension here.” The sudden interest in Here belies its often overlooked position in the technology world. While Google Maps is used in more than one billion smartphones worldwide, the Nokia unit, which until recently was somewhat hampered by the Finnish company’s close relationship with Microsoft, has instead focused primarily on offering mapping services to other companies, instead of directly to consumers. FedEx, for example, has used Here’s mapping data to manage its fleet of delivery trucks worldwide. Deutsche Telekom, the German carrier that owns T-Mobile, has built smartphone apps with Nokia’s services that allows people to share their locations with friends and family through their cellphones. But it’s the automotive industry, where Here holds up to an 80 percent global market share for built-in car navigation systems, that has become a main focus. The mapping service has becoming a crucial component for the automakers pursuing driverless car projects. In 2013, for instance, Mercedes-Benz teamed up with Here to test an autonomous car around 60 miles of German roads. The trial included instant 3-D modeling of nearby cars and constant corrections from the car’s  computer. So far, many automakers have preferred to use Nokia’s services over those provided by Google because of the search giant’s own ambitions in the nascent driverless car industry. Yet Nokia’s mapping technology may become unavailable if a new owner of the mapping unit decides to limit what other companies can do with the data.\\n\\n\\nUber Lures Top Google Executive and Shifts David Plouffe’s Duties: Continuing its quest for top Silicon Valley talent, Uber said on Wednesday that it had hired Rachel Whetstone, Google’s longtime head of communications, to be its senior vice president for policy and communications. While Ms. Whetstone’s appointment is a prominent talent grab for Uber, the ride-hailing start-up, it also shuffles the highest ranks of the company. She will take over the role of David Plouffe, the political strategist and former campaign manager for President Obama. Uber simultaneously confirmed that Mr. Plouffe will move to a position as chief adviser to the company and to Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, as well as take a seat on Uber’s board. It is an abrupt change to the six-year-old start-up’s communications team, as Mr. Plouffe was hired less than a year ago to run the company’s communications strategy. At the time of his appointment, the company described his role as similar to that of running a political campaign, with Uber as “the candidate.” His abilities were even praised by executives outside Uber. “David is uniquely suited to scale and lead the same kind of insurgent campaign he did in 2008 for a Silicon Valley tech company, bridging the worlds of business and politics,” Eric E. Schmidt, Google’s executive chairman, said at the time. Since Mr. Plouffe joined Uber, the company has been more aggressive about polishing its image, engaging in fewer public skirmishes and offering a gentler public tone. Uber has tried mending fences with European regulators who are wary of the service, and has undertaken numerous charitable efforts, including pickups for clothing donations and food-drive charity efforts. Over time, it has reduced the number of headlines about its pugnacious tendency to play rough with competitors. Ms. Whetstone, who will join Uber in June, has been at Google 10 years, helping lead it through antitrust battles across two continents and investigations by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as numerous consumer privacy inquiries. Her move to Uber was first reported by the tech news site Recode. She is another in a string of Google communications employees who have left the company to join hot start-ups. Last fall, Jill Hazelbaker left for Snapchat, while others have left for companies like Square, Pinterest and Tesla. But Ms. Whetstone’s departure is different. Uber and Google have long been partners in certain areas — Uber relies on Google’s mapping technology and has taken hundreds of millions from Google’s venture capital arm — but both companies have started to distance themselves from one another. Uber has made a bid for Nokia’s mapping unit, Here, which could lessen the company’s reliance on Google.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNew Facebook Ads Come With a Call Button to Ring Up Businesses: Facebook has built a \"call\" button people can tap to call businesses directly from an ad. More than 30 million businesses have Facebook pages, and now they can add the instant call button or a \"get directions\" button in marketing campaigns. The buttons open more direct-response marketing opportunities on Facebook, which previously only offered businesses the ability to ask users for Likes.  Facebook is calling them \"local awareness ads,\" and they can target users by neighborhood. \"Our new local awareness objective is the first Facebook ad objective created explicitly for local businesses,\" Facebook said in its post today announcing the new features. Local businesses can set up a campaign with the new buttons from their Facebook pages and see the results. According to Facebook, the ads reach the most people for the least money. One example showed an unnamed advertiser spending $40, reaching 6,500 people and generating six calls. Of course, Facebook is not the first to offer a call button. Google\\'s search gives users call and directions links, and Twitter also has similar offerings. Facebook topped 2 million advertisers earlier this year, and it credited much of its new business to a focus on small and medium-size businesses.\\n\\n\\nWal-Mart to Challenge Amazon Prime With $50 Shipping Service: Wal-Mart Stores Inc. will offer a $50-a-year unlimited free-shipping service for online customers starting this summer, seeking to challenge the $99 Prime service offered by retail rival Amazon.com Inc. The service will be available by invitation only in select markets, said Ravi Jariwala, a spokesman for Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart. More than 1 million items -- including apparel, sporting goods, electronics and toys -- will be available for delivery in three days or less, Jariwala said. Jariwala declined to say what markets will be included in the initial test of the service, how long it will last or how many people will be invited. The move ratchets up competition in e-commerce, where Wal-Mart has been trying to make inroads. While the company is the world’s largest retail chain, Amazon dominates online shopping. Prime has emerged as a key weapon for Seattle-based Amazon because it keeps customers loyal, making it ripe for imitation. In the U.S., customers pay $99 a year for Amazon Prime membership, which includes delivery discounts and online streaming of movies, television shows and music. Prime membership grew by more than 50 percent in 2014 from a base of “tens of millions,” according to Amazon. Prime members also spend more than occasional shoppers. For that reason, Amazon is trying to boost Prime membership with new perks. In December, it introduced same-day delivery for Prime members in Manhattan and has since expanded the service to additional cities, including Dallas and Miami. Macquarie Research analyst Ben Schachter estimated last month that Amazon has at least 35 million Prime members and that approximately 50 percent of U.S. households will have a membership by 2020. Wal-Mart, meanwhile, is trying to pull out of a broader slump and improve customer service. The company cut its sales forecast in February, and higher spending on wages and other investments have raised concerns for investors. Wal-Mart shares declined 1 percent to $78.16 at the close in New York on Wednesday. They have dropped 9 percent so far this year.\\n\\n\\nCisco Earnings: Quarterly Revenue $12.1B, +5% Y/Y; Net Income $2.4B; Shares Flat; Analysts Hail Cisco\\'s Resilience: Cisco Systems delivered gains in quarterly profit and sales on Wednesday that slightly surpassed Wall Street’s expectations. The company reported a 12 percent increase in net profit, to $2.4 billion. Its operating earnings of 54 cents a share were just above analysts’ consensus estimate of 53 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 5 percent, to $12.1 billion, essentially in line with the average analyst forecast of $12.07 billion. Parts of the business were weak: Sales to telecommunications and cable companies were off by 7 percent and sales in emerging markets slipped, particularly in Russia and China. Cisco shares were down slightly in after-hours trading. Over the last year, Cisco shares have climbed 28 percent. Over the years, Cisco rivals have surfaced from Silicon Valley to China. But Cisco has managed to stay on top. “Its scale and breadth are extremely hard to replicate,” said Amitabh Passi, an analyst at UBS. That heft amounts to what Pierre Ferragu, an analyst for the research firm Sanford C. Bernstein, called “a powerful platform advantage” in a report last week.\\n\\n\\nIts OK to Fail - India learns to \\'fail fast\\' as tech start-up culture takes root: After ping pong tables, motivational posters and casual dress codes, India\\'s tech start-ups are following Silicon Valley\\'s lead and embracing the \"fail fast\" culture credited with fuelling creativity and success in the United States. Taking failure as a norm is a major cultural shift in India, where high-achieving children are typically expected to take steady jobs at recognized firms. A failed venture hurts family status and even marriage prospects. But that nascent acceptance, fueled by returning engineers and billions of dollars in venture fund investment, is for many observers a sign that India\\'s $150 billion tech industry is coming of age, moving from a back office powerhouse to a creative force. \"There is obviously increased acceptance,\" said Raghunandan G, co-founder of TaxiForSure, which was sold to rival Ola this year. He is now investing in others\\' early stage ventures. \"My co-founder Aprameya (Radhakrishna) used to have lines of prospective brides to meet ... the moment we started our own company, all those prospective alliances disappeared. No one wanted their daughters to marry a start-up guy.\" Srikanth Chunduri returned to India after studying at Duke University in the United States, and is now working on his second venture. \"I think what\\'s encouraging is that acceptance of failure is increasing despite the very deep-rooted Asian culture where failure is a big no,\" he said. The shift has come about, executives say, as engineers began returning from Silicon Valley to cash in on India\\'s own boom, as hundreds of millions of Indians go online. \"Investors too want to find the next Flipkart, and most of them come from Silicon Valley backgrounds, so they bring that culture,\" said Stewart Noakes, co-founder of TechHub, a global community and workspace for tech entrepreneurs. \"That\\'s changing the Indian norms. It\\'s becoming ok to fail and try again.\"\\n\\n\\nAmazon Unveils Advertising Platform for Mobile-App Developers: Amazon.com Inc. unveiled a new advertising platform for mobile-applications developers, a push by the largest Web retailer to grab a bigger piece of the smartphone advertising market dominated by Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. The service lets developers promote their apps on Android smartphones and tablets as well as Amazon tablets, paying Amazon each time a user clicks an advertisement displayed through the system. Campaigns start at $100. Amazon is a small player in the $28.7 billion U.S. mobile-advertising industry. The Seattle-based company has less than a 1 percent share of the market, compared with Google’s 35 percent and Facebook’s 17 percent, according to EMarketer Inc. Spending to market apps alone is projected to rise 80 percent this year to $3 billion, with Facebook leading that category.\\n\\n\\nFacebook Begins Testing Instant Articles From News Publishers: Facebook’s long-rumored plan to directly host articles from news organizations will start on Wednesday, concluding months of delicate negotiations between the Internet giant and publishers that covet its huge audience but fear its growing power. Nine media companies, including NBC News and The New York Times, have agreed to the deal, despite concerns that their participation could eventually undermine their own businesses. The program will begin with a few articles but is expected to expand quickly. Users of iPhones will see glossy cover videos and photos tagged with map coordinates. Most important for impatient smartphone users, the company says, the so-called instant articles will load up to 10 times faster than they normally would since readers stay on Facebook rather than follow a link to another site Facebook has gone to unusual lengths to court the publishers participating in the project, some details of which were previously published by The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. The news publishers can either sell and embed advertisements in the articles, keeping all of the revenue, or allow Facebook to sell ads, with the social network getting 30 percent of the proceeds. Facebook is also permitting the news companies to collect data about the people reading the articles with the same tools they use to track visitors to their own sites. For publishers, the Facebook initiative represents the latest in a series of existential balancing acts. The social network, which has more than 1.4 billion active users worldwide, captures more attention of mobile users — and prompts more visits to news sites — than virtually any other service. Publishers have little choice but to cooperate with Facebook, said Vivian Schiller, a former executive at NBC, The New York Times and Twitter who now advises media companies and brands. “That’s where the audience is,” Ms. Schiller said. “It’s too massive to ignore.” But Facebook’s role as a powerful distributor of news makes many people in the industry uneasy. The fear is that it could become more of a destination than their own sites for the work they produce, drawing away readers and advertising. Facebook clearly plays an important role as a gatekeeper to news. Nearly half of American Internet users said they got news about politics and government on Facebook during the course of a week, almost as many as got such news from local television, according to a survey last year by the Pew Research Center. Facebook has a long history of changing the algorithm that determines what people see in their feeds. Zynga, the mobile gaming company, built its business on Facebook only to lose much of its traffic when the company changed the rules to make a user’s game activity less visible to friends. Last year, Facebook decided to downgrade the prominence of viral content like cat videos and promote “high quality” news content. A month ago, it changed course again to highlight personal posts by users’ friends and family.\\n\\n\\nDiverging Internet Usage Patterns: Facebook, Instagram Rule in the US, Messaging Apps Score Elsewhere: Messaging apps are becoming the most heavily-used type of app in a majority of key markets worldwide, based on both smartphone sessions and time spent in apps. However, according to new data from App Annie, the U.S. is an exception to that trend. Here, Facebook still dominates in terms of smartphone sessions, while both Facebook and Instagram led by time spent in apps. The data collected was based on Android sessions in the first quarter of this year, so it’s not necessarily a full picture of the mobile application ecosystem or app usage – but it is sourced from one of the industry’s largest datasets on mobile data. In fact, App Annie’s dataset recently grew following its acquisition of  mobile measurement firm Mobidia last week. The firm is able to now detail app usage data from millions of users across 60 countries. With Mobidia and App Annie’s data combined, the company put out its first-ever report examining usage-level trends regarding mobile applications, which looked, in particular, at countries like the U.S., U.K., Germany, Japan, and South Korea. Not surprisingly, given that smartphones are primarily communication devices, the report found that within every key market, apps in the Communication and Social categories accounted for at least 40% of smartphone sessions on Android. And that trend was similar to how users spent time in apps, says App Annie. In the U.S., Social remained the top category based on sessions per active user, thanks to Facebook’s prominent position here. But in the U.K., Germany, Japan, and South Korea, Communication was in the #1 position, referring to their preference for messaging apps.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

In March of 2014, the company sunk a huge sum – US$215 million – into American messaging app Tango. At the time it seemed a bit odd: why would Alibaba invest so much into an American chat app with no real footprint in China? The picture has become a bit clearer today with the announcement of Tango shops. Tango VP Chi-Chao Chang told Tech in Asia that the goal is to make the in-app shopping experience convenient and social: Tango users will be able to browse and search merchandise. They will be able to share personalized catalogs or collections of merchandise with other Tango users, and securely purchase from millions of products available. To start, Tango shops will feature products from two partners: Wal-Mart and AliExpress. AliExpress, of course, is Alibaba’s consumer-facing global ecommerce platform, and Tango users will have access to the entirety of AliExpress’s offerings via the in app-search feature. Chang said that Tango will also curate special deals from both providers that will be made available to users on a daily basis. It should come as no surprise that as an investor and now a partner, Alibaba has been heavily involved in the development of Tango’s new shops feature. Chang said Alibaba has even given Tango “special access” to products most other companies don’t have access to, and I got the impression that without Alibaba, the launch might look quite different. “They have been extremely involved,” Chang said of Alibaba. More here: Tango Offers Shopping on Its Messaging Service: Tango, a peer-to-peer mobile messaging service, planned to announce on Tuesday it would start offering shopping services. Its catalog includes most of what is sold by Walmart and Alibaba, a total of two million products.Tango, which last year received an investment of about $250 million from Alibaba, may be making the strongest move yet. The shopping application involves a button on the screen that opens access to a wide range of products.People can browse the catalog in a number of ways, create personal selections for friends to browse, buy items, or message the details to friends. Payments are handled through credit card information stored in Tango. The company appears more interested in gathering customers, and data on them, rather than profiting directly on commerce. It is taking no commission on the mobile sales.Out of the gate, it is quite a range of goods. In a brief test of the service, from Walmart I found a casket with Yankees logos on the lining, for $2,399. There was also a $4.58 box of honey nut breakfast cereal. Alibaba had women’s dresses and antifreeze, among many products (things like guns and alcohol are not available.)Should this method of commerce catch on, it could have profound implications for brands that make their own mobile apps, hoping to attract shoppers. “Would you keep a Levi’s app and a Best Buy app, and an app for every merchant, or would you go to one place where it’s all there?” Mr. Setton said. “I’m biased, but I think this interface rules.”Maybe, but only over a limited empire. The catalog will initially be available only in the United States. Tango has about 300 million registered users, about one-quarter to one-third of whom are in the United States. It seems to be the first such messaging commerce app for the American audience, though Japan’s LINE and WeChat of China offer commerce capabilities.Tango, which started in 2009, has previously offered video calling, games and photo sharing, among other things. Tango’s technology enables it to send a lot of data at low cost to the company, offering free services to customers. \\n\\n\\nAliyun, Alibaba\\'s Cloud Unit, Makes Push in the Middle East, to set up Data Center in Dubai: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s cloud-computing subsidiary is teaming up with Dubai-based Meraas Holding LLC as the company uses its technology to extend its influence beyond China. The joint venture of Alibaba’s Aliyun and Meraas will provide a broad swath of technology to businesses and governments in the Middle East and North Africa. Jack Ma, Alibaba’s executive chairman, and the rest of the Hangzhou, China-based multinational’s management team, laid the groundwork for the deal in a meeting last September with the ruler of Dubai, Aliyun President Simon Hu said in an interview. The joint venture will provide technical services for transportation, communication, urban infrastructure, electricity service, economic development, and urban planning, as well as cloud computing, Hu said. In a presentation to investors this month, Alibaba said that an expansion of cloud computing services was a priority for the coming fiscal year. “At the end of this year or next year, no matter where you are when you go to Dubai, no matter whether eating or sightseeing, you will encounter one of the infrastructures that is provided by Aliyun,” Hu said. As part of the venture, Aliyun and Meraas will build a technology hub consisting of a data center, along with hospitality, residential and commercial spaces. By expanding its cloud abroad, Aliyun ratchets up competition with companies such as Microsoft Corp., Google Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. These U.S. firms haven’t put large data centers in the Middle East. More here\\n\\n\\nAfter Big-Bang Start, Can Tesla\\'s Battery Hit $1 Billion Faster Than the iPhone? Tesla’s new line of big, stackable batteries for homes and businesses started with a bang. The reservations reported in the first week are valued at roughly $800 million, according to numbers crunched by Bloomberg. If Tesla converts even a fraction of those reservations into actual sales, the battery roll-out could measure up as one of the biggest ever for a new product category. The new line of storage batteries is designed to extend solar power into the night and save companies money on its electric bills during expensive peak hours. Any comparison of batteries to smartphones and erection pills is, of course, a stretch. Most of Tesla’s battery revenue will come from utilities, not the consumers who snapped up iPhones and Viagra. The price of the new batteries is also much higher. Tesla’s Powerwall units designed for home users cost $3,000 to $3,500 per unit, not including installation, while the commercial batteries are sold in roughly $25,000 incremental blocks. Tesla hasn’t even defined what qualifies as a \"reservation\" at this point. Of the $800 million in reservations from the first week, almost $625 million came from businesses and utilities that would seem likely to complete the transaction. The remaining reservations from home users are little more than expressions of interest made through a no-strings online reservation system. Manufacturing giant batteries will also be much more difficult to scale than Pfizer’s little blue pill, which was filling 46,000 prescriptions a day by the end of its first month on the market. Tesla won\\'t begin shipping batteries until this summer, and it’s already sold out through mid-2016. Still, approaching $1 billion of interest, just days after introducing path-breaking product, marks a significant achievement. Tesla is going to need that battery revenue as soon as it can get it: The company is burning through cash to invest in the Model X electric SUV due later this year, the more affordable Model 3 slated to arrive 2017, and a $5 billion battery factory to power it all.  In a call with analysts last week, Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk wouldn’t rule out the possibility that the battery business could someday exceed electric-car revenue.   Electricity storage products aren\\'t new. But Tesla’s price, power, and packaging set these batteries apart in a way that echoes the gap between the first iPhone and the smartphones that came before it. Now Musk has brought an Apple-launch level of public interest to what\\'s essentially a infrastructure product, albeit one with potential to transform the way electrical grids are managed and the speed that solar power is adopted.  The next daunting challenge will be to turn that interest into bookable revenue for Tesla. \\n\\n\\nVerizon Bets on Video Ads in $4 Billion Deal for AOL: The nation’s biggest wireless operator sees its digital future in a company that still offers dial-up Internet service. However backward that may seem, Verizon Communications’ $4.4 billion all-cash deal for AOL, announced on Tuesday, illustrates how the communications industry has changed — even if the underlying rationale has not — from the days when the Internet pioneer told users “You’ve got mail.” AOL may be known for its dot-com rise and fall and for current web content like The Huffington Post , but Verizon is looking to gain the company’s powerful but little-known mobile video and advertising technology. That could make Verizon’s own phone and Internet offerings more appealing to consumers, and to advertisers. The motive is clear. Consumers are increasingly watching videos — from YouTube to HBO — on mobile phones, tablets and laptops. And big media companies and advertisers are only beginning to grapple with this rapidly evolving market. By layering AOL’s technology atop its 109 million wireless connections and growing cable television business, Verizon is betting that it can make billions of dollars by selling ads against streaming video. Comcast, the biggest cable operator, acquired NBCUniversal, the big television and movie studio company. AT&T, Verizon’s nearest rival, is acquiring DirecTV, the satellite television business. And Sprint, another wireless operator, is making its own forays into content. “The telecoms are clearly saying, ‘We’re not going to be dumb pipes,’ ” said Jonathan Miller, the chief executive of AOL from 2002 to 2006, who is now a venture capitalist. Yet in acquiring AOL, Verizon gets more than just new advertising technology. It also takes ownership of a company with a troubled legacy and a muddled present. AOL operates the dwindling but still profitable dial-up Internet business, runs a collection of news websites and employs big personalities including Arianna Huffington and its chief executive, Tim Armstrong. Verizon covets two main pieces of AOL’s mobile and video technology offerings. One is its big network of original video content, which is home to lucrative online video advertising. The other is its so-called programmatic advertising business, a system that matches online advertisers with consumers across different platforms, and collects valuable data along the way.\\n\\n\\nWill It Be a Summer of Consolidation in Ad Tech? AOL could just be the beginning as rumors fly. Verizon\\'s $4.4 billion purchase of AOL spark a summer of acquisitions in the ad-tech space? It depends on whom you ask. Yahoo has reportedly considered making Foursquare a big offer in recent weeks. The Google-purchasing-Twitter chatter has gone on for months and won\\'t die. Yelp is reportedly entertaining suitors from Yahoo to Google and Amazon, with some analysts speculating that foreign companies Alibaba and Rakuten are in the mix. Even mighty Salesforce.com has found itself the subject of speculation about a Microsoft takeover. Rich Guest, president of North American operations, Tribal Worldwide, said the Twitter-to-Google hubbub makes the most sense. \"I think that there were first rumors of an AOL-Verizon tie-up during CES 2015, which gives credence to the school of thinking that believes \\'where there is smoke, there is likely fire,\\'\" Guest explained. \"Twitter is an amazing platform, which could add value to the product portfolios of many media or technology companies. Given all of the rumors of a Twitter-Google tie-up, I wouldn\\'t be surprised if that happened sometime in 2015.\" MediaCom CMO Stephanie Fierman said, \"I think many expect a transaction involving Yahoo at some point in the foreseeable future.\"\\n\\n\\nGoDaddy Earnings: Quarterly Revenue $376M, +17% Y/Y; Net Loss Narrows to $43M; Shares Gyrate, end 3% down: Web-hosting company GoDaddy Inc (GDDY.N) posted a 17.5 percent rise in revenue in its first quarterly report as a public company, helped by customer additions and an increase in revenue per average user. GoDaddy forecast revenue of between $390 million and $395 million for the second quarter and between $1.60 billion and $1.61 billion for the full year. The company, which manages about 59 million Internet domains, nearly a fifth of the world\\'s total, said it had 13.1 million customers at the end of the first quarter ended March 31, compared with 11.9 million a year earlier. Average revenue per user rose to $115 from $105. GoDaddy, known for its racy TV commercials, said bookings rose about 14 percent to $498.7 million in the first quarter. The company\\'s net loss narrowed to $43.4 million, or 34 cents per share, for the first quarter ended March 31, from $51.3 million, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $376.3 million from $320.2 million. The company\\'s shares rose as much as 5.5 percent in after-market trading, before reversing course sharply to trade down as much as 3.7 percent. Up to Monday\\'s close, the stock had risen more than 33 percent since GoDaddy went public on April 1.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXiaomi’s rolls out a money market fund  to take on Alibaba and Tencent: Like Baidu and Alibaba, Xiaomi is eyeing China’s finance industry and seeing dollar signs. Today the company is officially launching a money-market fund called Huoqibao inside a new standalone app called “Xiaomi Finance.” Like the Alibaba-affiliated Yu’ebao, Xiaomi’s Huoqibao lets consumers save excess cash and earn interest from it. After registering for a Xiaomi Finance account with one’s national ID, users can bind a bank card to the app can store as little as RMB 1 (about US$0.15). The fund is managed by China’s E Fund Management and currently offers an annual return rate of 4.26 percent. This marks Xiaomi’s first foray into serious finance, but it has dabbled in money in the past. Huoqibao was once available in beta for select users of Xiaomi Wallet, another standalone app that was primarily used to manage virtual currency known as Mi coins. Users from inside China could purchase Mi coins through bound bank cards or Alipay accounts, and redeem them for customized launcher themes, or media like e-books. Compared to China’s other internet giants, Xiaomi is slightly late to the money market game. As of late 2014, Yu’ebao had over 185 million users] and and a fund size of RMB 578.93 billion (about US$93 billion). Yu’ebao’s deep integration with Alipay Wallet, which is also tied to Alibaba’s mobile ecommerce properties like Tmall and Taobao, make it tough for new customers to miss. Tencent and Baidu also have mobile money-market funds of their own. Of these three companies, Xiaomi is arguably in the weakest position when it comes to promoting consumer finance products. Alibaba already owns the biggest pool of money online in China thanks to Alipay, and Tencent owns the best mobile real estate thanks to WeChat, China’s most popular messaging app. Messaging apps and ecommerce marketplaces both contain powerful network effects that help ensure longevity. Unlike these companies (and arguably any other company in the world), Xiaomi is extremely well positioned to benefit from the emergence of smart home devices. Since thousands of customers log onto Xiaomi’s website to buy a smartphones every week, it can leverage that focused attention by selling smart lightbulbs and smart cameras and taking a cut in the process. Many of the hardware startups it invests in go on to list their items on the company’s ecommerce platform. Documents discovered last year by the Wall Street Journal indicated that Xiaomi makes the majority of its revenue and profits from hardware sales. But the company continues to invest in “services” – broadly defined as all of the semi-tangibles one buys on the internet. The company claimed to earn more than US$1 billlion in revenues from services in 2014, marking 6 percent of its total revenues.\\n\\n\\nChinese Smartphone Makers Try to Make Inroads in India: The era of fast growth is coming to an end in China, where the research group IDC said on Monday that phone sales fell 4 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the first contraction in six years. IDC expects no growth in China’s smartphone market in 2015. India’s smartphone sales are just a fraction of China’s. But as one of the fastest-growing smartphone markets in the world, with hundreds of millions of potential new customers, India may indicate whether a new generation of Chinese hardware companies can grow beyond their country’s borders. It is intensely competitive, with more than 150 brands. Among the best-selling brands are several indigenous companies with an inside track on local phone habits. Another top seller is a multinational, Samsung, which has deep experience selling across different cultures. Xiaomi, the most successful Chinese company in India, owned only 4 percent of the market in the fourth quarter. But India is also the only place that has a scale like China’s. Indians are expected to buy 111 million smartphones this year, and 149 million in 2016. And China’s smartphone makers say Chinese and Indian customers have a lot in common: Both tend to obsess over arcane features and specs, and both are highly sensitive to cost. Many Chinese companies are trying to make their case directly to potential Indian buyers online. It is a technique pioneered by Xiaomi, which used e-commerce to overcome difficult-to-manage and expensive storefronts and distribution deals in China and now India. So-called flash sales, which offer limited batches of phones to drive up demand and build brand cachet, have rattled the current top sellers in India, the local company Micromax and the South Korean giant Samsung, according to analysts. The tactic is cheap and effective, said Mr. Sharma of Coolpad: “We don’t need to spend tens of millions of dollars on marketing or building distribution networks.” One of the most successful Chinese brands in India so far, Xiaomi has gone to great lengths to create products catering to customers there. Its new Mi 4i phone costs more than many rivals at about $200, but supports six Indian languages, with local engineers working to increase that number. The company has also built an online store that focuses on India’s passions of cricket and Bollywood, and has plans to open 100 stores around the country before the end of the year. “We want to become an Indian company,” Xiaomi’s chief executive, Lei Jun, told a local newspaper after the introduction of the Mi 4i.\\n\\n\\nSoftBank names Nikesh Arora President and Son\\'s Likely Successor: Japan\\'s SoftBank Corp unveiled a management reshuffle on Monday, appointing investments head Nikesh Arora as president and naming him as a potential successor to CEO Masayoshi Son, as the telecoms conglomerate steps up its overseas expansion. The move comes as Son and SoftBank are battling to make their 2013 acquisition of U.S. carrier Sprint Corp for more than $20 billion profitable. A sluggish Japanese economy, though, has forced the company to increasingly look overseas for growth. Announcing Arora\\'s appointment at SoftBank\\'s earnings conference, billionaire Son, who is relinquishing the president\\'s post, said the former Google Inc executive was a \"strong candidate\" to lead the company in future. \"Yes. He\\'s 10 years younger than me, and he has more abilities than me,\" Son told reporters, when asked if Arora was a potential candidate to succeed him. \"The last nine months I\\'ve spent with him have made me sure of that, but I\\'m not going to retire soon,\" Son said. SoftBank has been weighed down by the costs of trying to turn around Sprint, which has been in intense competition with larger U.S. rivals AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. Sprint, in which SoftBank owns 80 percent, has undergone a long-haul revamping of its network, shedding thousands of jobs and triggering a mass exodus of subscribers. SoftBank has made a string of other investments in recent years, including $250 million in privately-held Hollywood movie studio Legendary Entertainment, and $600 million in Travice Inc, the operator of Chinese taxi hailing app Kuaidi Dache. As well as being the largest investor in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, SoftBank has plans to invest $10 billion in India\\'s potentially huge but under-developed online retail market. \"We expect more investments and acquisitions, even more so than now,\" Son said. \"Going forward, the overseas market will be the main factor for SoftBank.\" SoftBank posted a 9 percent fall in operating profit for the year ended March to 982.7 billion yen ($8.2 billion), hurt by the absence of one-time gains enjoyed the year before.\\n\\n\\nRackspace Earnings: Revenue $480M (+14% Y/Y) Net Income $28M; Shares Fall 13% on Outlook: Rackspace Hosting Inc, a web hosting company, forecast revenue for the current quarter below market estimates and said a strong dollar hurt its revenue growth in the first quarter. Shares of the company, which faces tough competition from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Google Inc (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) were down 13 percent in extended trading on Monday. Revenue from a contract with a \"large\" financial services company will be realized only in the third quarter, hurting revenue growth in the second quarter, Rackspace Chief Executive Taylor Rhodes said in a post-earnings call. Rackspace Hosting will also take a one-time charge in the quarter as a customer moved some of its \"production elements\" away from a Rackspace data center in the United Kingdom. Rackspace leases online storage space to companies and provides its clients management and support services for their cloud-based operations. It gets about a third of its revenue from outside the United States. The company said foreign currency exchange rates hurt its revenue growth. Revenue increased 14.1 percent to $480.2 million in the first quarter ended March 31. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 16.6 percent. Analysts had expected revenue of $481.6 million. Net income rose to $28.4 million, or 20 cents per share, from $25.4 million, or 18 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts expected a profit of 20 cents per share. Rackspace shares closed at $53.13 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. They have risen 89 percent in the past 12 months.\\n\\n\\nIn global first, Uber tests cash payments for cabs in India: Uber is testing cash payments in India as the online taxi-hailing company seeks a stronger foothold in a country where many fewer people have credit cards than internet connections. San Francisco-based Uber has grown rapidly in value to be worth around $40 billion. But in India it has lagged local rival Ola, which has about 80 percent of the organized cab market. Many analysts say that is because Uber has not adapted its business model enough to suit India\\'s needs. Uber said on Tuesday it was piloting cash payments for cabs in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, in a first for the company globally. Until now, Uber\\'s mobile application around the world has charged customers through credit cards or other electronic payment methods. India has about 20 million credit cards for a population of 1.3 billion. Though the government is trying to change this, most purchases are done with cash. Ola and other Indian cab services accept cash for rides, while e-commerce giant Amazon introduced a cash on delivery option when it launched in India. \"Tradition dictates that cash plays a big role for Indian consumers,\" said Siddharth Shanker, Uber\\'s general manager in Hyderabad.\\n\\n\\nIn 1.7M miles of test drives over 6 years, Google\\'s self-driving cars have been in only 11 accidents, and caused none: Internet search company Google Inc\\'s self-driving cars have been involved in 11 accidents, but have not been the cause of any, over the last six years since the project began, the program\\'s director said on Monday. A team of drivers that is testing the fleet of more than 20 vehicles have driven 1.7 million miles so far. \"...Not once was the self-driving car the cause of the accident,\" Chris Urmson said in a post on technology news website Backchannel\\'s blog Medium. (bit.ly/1GZciuW) No one was injured in the accidents, Urmson added. \"If you spend enough time on the road, accidents will happen whether you\\'re in a car or a self-driving car.\" The cars had been hit from behind seven times, mainly at traffic lights, with a majority of the accidents being on city streets rather than on freeways.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLate to the party, global banks try to muscle into India\\'s start-up boom: Global investment banks are scrambling to get a piece of the action from India\\'s booming technology start-ups, having missed out on the initial flurry of deal-making to their better-connected but much smaller domestic rivals. Banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are looking to hire more bankers in India and are now regularly attending \"bake-offs\" to pitch for advisory roles on deals, according to several banking industry sources. Foreign money has been pouring into India\\'s fast-growing e-commerce sector, with investors ranging from Japan\\'s Softbank Corp to Singapore\\'s Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL] and GIC Private Ltd [GIC.UL] piling in. Many large global investment banks have stayed away from work in the emerging sector though due to the relatively small deal sizes. Now they are stepping up efforts to build relationships while the companies are still young - learning lessons from China where many of them are struggling to compete with small boutique banks as Internet deals pick up speed. \"Several of these companies will be large IPO candidates in the next 12 to 24 months, so the big banks have to start positioning themselves for this,\" said Harish HV, a partner in India at advisory firm Grant Thornton. The number of venture funding deals for technology start-ups in India in the first quarter of 2015 was the highest in nine quarters and exceeded the number of such deals in China, according to data from CB Insights. The total value of investments in India topped $1 billion for the third straight quarter. To compete with local rivals like Avendus Capital and Kotak Mahindra Capital, foreign banks are now pitching for relatively small deals at start-ups, hopeful they will eventually lead to more lucrative work, banking sources said. Avendus, which focused on the tech sector before the deal momentum picked up, ranks fourth in the advisory league table for announced technology deals in India so far this year. That\\'s ahead of bigger global rivals including Credit Suisse, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan, according to Thomson Reuters data. Now foreign investment banks are starting to make in-roads. Jefferies\\' India arm advised home shopping firm Naaptol.com to raise about $20 million last month from Japan\\'s Mitsui & Co Ltd and some existing investors. Citigroup Inc, which advised Indian online payment services provider One97 Communications in raising funds from Alibaba Group affiliate Ant Financial Services in February, is \"very focused\" on the internet space in India, said Madhur Deora, its managing director for investment banking in India. Global banks vying to offer services like loan financing to online retailers like Flipkart and Snapdeal, hoping this could help them secure mandates on any future IPOs, sources said.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba in talks to buy $1.2 billion stake in India phone maker Micromax - 20% stake purchase would value Micromax at $6B: Alibaba Group Holding (BABA.N) is in talks with India\\'s Micromax Informatics (IPO-MINF.NS) to buy an about 20 percent stake in the smartphone maker, helping the Chinese e-commerce giant expand in one of the world\\'s fastest growing markets for the devices, several people with direct knowledge of the matter said. The deal, if completed, would see Alibaba investing as much as $1.2 billion in Micromax, the second-largest smartphone brand in India by sales, at up to $6 billion, two of the people said. India is the world\\'s third largest smartphone market and was the fastest growing in the Asia Pacific region in the third quarter of last year, according to industry research firm International Data Corporation. Micromax and Alibaba began talks on the stake sale after discussions with investors led by Japanese telecoms firm Softbank Corp (9984.T) stalled over differences in valuations, the sources said. \"The Softbank talks are not officially over, but it\\'ll be hard to get back on track,\" said one of the people. Softbank is the largest shareholder in Alibaba. The sources said Alibaba wants to use the Micromax deal to tap into the boom in the number of internet users in India, which is also one of the world\\'s most rapidly growing smartphone markets. Growth in India, and especially in mobile transactions, would help Alibaba offset stiff competition at home from domestic rivals including JD.com Inc (JD.O), as well as what appears to be growing e-commerce user saturation. \"The talks are centered around using Micromax devices as a platform to get into a serious business of its own in India,\" said one of the sources, referring to Alibaba. Alibaba, for example, would be able to roll out services such as Alipay, its online payment platform, on Micromax phones. Ant Financial Services Group, which owns Alipay, is China\\'s largest payment service provider and is controlled by Alibaba\\'s executive chairman and founder Jack Ma. The stake sale is aimed at helping Micromax raise capital as it expands into new business segments including personal computing. The company is seeking funds from private investors, or a possible stock market listing, its co-founder told Reuters. Micromax started up in India in 2008, and its affordable, large-screen phones are now the country\\'s most popular after Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) smartphones. Micromax counts Sequoia Capital and TA Associates among its investors.\\n\\n\\nUber might raised $1.5B at $50B valuation: Uber is fund-raising again. The mobile car-hailing application is in early talks to raise a new round of financing that could value the start-up at $50 billion, according to a person familiar with the discussions, who spoke anonymously because the process is confidential. Uber could raise around $1.5 billion, given the amount of interest from investors in the company, the person said. The new capital will not be used primarily for expansion purposes, unlike Uber’s previous financing rounds. Instead, the funding is strategic, with an eye on partnerships, the person said. Uber, based in San Francisco, has raised money relentlessly in recent years at rapidly swelling valuations. So far, the company has raised more than $4 billion as it moves into new markets globally, disrupting established taxi and other transportation industries by letting people request rides through their smartphones. The company was founded in 2009 and is led by Travis Kalanick, who is chief executive. In December, Uber closed a $1.2 billion round of financing that valued it at $40 billion. The company then moved to accommodate additional investors like Baidu, the Chinese Internet giant. That round followed one in June, when the service said that it had raised $1.2 billion at a valuation of $17 billion. At a $50 billion valuation, Uber would be the world’s most valuable private start-up, topping the Chinese electronics maker Xiaomi, which was last valued at $45 billion. It would also be worth more than publicly traded companies like FedEx, with a market value of $48 billion, and Nissan Motor, with a capitalization of $47 billion. The divide between Uber and other “unicorns” — Silicon Valley’s term for billion-dollar start-ups — would also grow. Even at its current $40 billion valuation, it was nearly triple that of other elite Silicon Valley start-ups like the data analysis firm Palantir, according to the research firm CB Insights. Among Silicon Valley start-ups, only Facebook had attained a $50 billion valuation as a private company.\\n\\n\\nPinterest Adds $186M To Series G Funding Round, Offers Secondary Sale To Employees Looking to Cash Out: Pinterest confirmed that it has padded its Series G funding a bit and is carrying out a new secondary sale that will allow employees to cash in some of their shares. As first reported by Re/code, the social sharing startup raised an additional $186 million in funding as part of its Series G round, bringing the total amount raised in that financing to $553 million. New investors in the round include Wellington Management Company and Goldman Sachs, while existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Bessemer, First Mark, SV Angel, Valiant, and Fidelity also participated. Altogether, the company has raised about $1.3 billion since being founded in 2009. In addition to the primary financing, Pinterest is carrying out a secondary sale for employees who wish to sell their vested at the $11 billion valuation of the Series G round. This is the second time Pinterest has offered the option of a secondary sale to its employees, with the first being held in October 2012.\\n\\n\\nApps Need A New Data Center Stack, Because Infra is Difficult to Get Right: Google, Facebook and Amazon serve billions of users overall — and many, many millions concurrently — and store incredible amounts of data. Yet they rarely crash. Once it finally decided to make a significant investment in infrastructure engineering, Twitter all but slayed the fail whale. Among some of the better-known technologies these companies have produced are MapReduce, Hadoop, Cassandra and Kafka. A new suite of tools — some created by startups, some in labs, some as open source projects — has also emerged in their image, designed to make applications perform and scale better, and sometimes to enable new capabilities altogether. These include technologies such as Spark, Storm and Elasticsearch. In concert with these advances, new architectures also caught on in order to address the problems that come with trying to develop applications that can run reliably at such extreme scale. One is the concept of microservices, which involves treating applications as a collection of services that might serve multiple applications, rather than as monolithic entities with their own dedicated components. Among other things, a service-oriented approach results in less dependency among components and the ability to scale individual services without re-architecting the entire application. Another big architectural trend has been containerization, whether it’s done via developer-friendly means like Docker or lower-level means like Linux control groups. Containers can make it easier to plug applications into distributed services and to shift the focus from deciding where something should run; instead, containers let developers focus on what their applications need to run. Taken as a whole, this new collection of distributed services and architectural techniques could be called the “data center application stack.” Anyone building an application that serves millions of users on multiple platforms, and can make use of the volume, variety and velocity of data today, is going to be using this collection of services or something very much like it. In fact, these technologies are all gaining popularity fast. Many are already staples in the technology repertoires of startups trying to deliver everything from the next huge consumer app to the next Salesforce.com. “Big data,” “real-time” and “Internet of Things” are more than just buzzwords. They’re imperatives for corporate success in many parts of the 21st century economy. However, the elephant in the room — which you might not hear from IT vendors, open source advocates or expert Facebook engineers — is that building out these capabilities is hard. Deploy, manage and scale Hadoop. Deploy, manage and scale Cassandra. Deploy, manage and scale Kubernetes. Rinse and repeat for every framework or service you want to use. At some point, companies probably will want to give a little thought to actually writing the application, building the data pipeline and making sure the architecture is resilient. Huge, engineer-rich companies such as Google and Microsoft solved (or largely solved) this problem for themselves with systems like Borg and Autopilot, respectively. The systems automatically manage resource allocation and high availability for the services and applications that run across their millions of servers. Algorithms, not developers or software architects, determine where things run and on how many machines. Sure, they’re great systems, but they’re also proprietary. Google only recently officially acknowledged Borg’s existence by publishing a paper on it. Microsoft has done very little public discussion of Autopilot. Neither are for sale.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeadership Change at Alibaba:\\xa0In the surprise leadership change, Mr. Ma picked Daniel Zhang, who has been at Alibaba for eight years, to lead one of the world’s largest Internet companies. Mr. Ma, in a letter to employees, portrayed the replacement of the chief executive, Jonathan Lu, as a sort of changing of the guard. ”Alibaba Group is ready to completely hand over management leadership to those of you who were born in the ’70s,” Mr. Ma wrote, adding that several other experienced Alibaba leaders would give up some day-to-day control to allow younger executives to rise. Mr. Zhang, who was born in 1972, has become well known among employees at Alibaba for his public speaking and charisma. Leading Alibaba’s investment call on Thursday, Mr. Zhang’s polished English underlined the divide between himself and Mr. Ma, who, though once an English teacher, speaks a more unorthodox, self-taught brand of the language. Within Alibaba, there is admiration for Mr. Zhang’s cosmopolitan management style, in part honed during stints early in his career at Arthur Andersen and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Mr. Lu, who is only a few years older than his replacement, is scheduled to step down as chief executive on Sunday, exactly two years after he took over from Mr. Ma. At the time of his ascent, he was portrayed as a utility player who would help the ballooning start-up manage its rapid growth. Mr. Lu will remain on the board. To many Alibaba employees, Mr. Zhang, who led the rise of the company’s Tmall shopping site, is known as one of the most capable of the new generation of leaders. Mr. Zhang will need all the youthful energy he can manage to steer an e-commerce goliath that employs more than 30,000 people across the globe. He will very likely move quickly to address company inefficiencies that Mr. Ma identified last week in a speech to employees in Beijing. During the speech, Mr. Ma said the company would strive not to have a net growth in employees over the coming year. Instead, he said, Alibaba will work to transfer employees between departments and use technology to smooth operations.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba Earnings:  Revenue $2.81B, +45% Y/Y; GMV $97B , 40% Y/Y; Shares up 7% despite slowest growth in 11 quarters: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) on Thursday posted a 45 percent rise in quarterly revenue, and shares of the Chinese e-commerce company jumped nearly 7 percent as investors cheered a smoother-than-expected transition to mobile transactions, which surpassed those from personal computers for the first time. The total value of transactions made on Alibaba\\'s platforms, known as gross merchandise volume (GMV), grew 40 percent to $97 billion in the quarter ended March 31. This was the lowest rate of growth in at least 11 quarters, despite sales on mobile devices growing 257 percent year-on-year to account for 51 percent of overall GMV. Alibaba may also be facing e-commerce user saturation. The increase of annual active buyers, or customers who buy at least one product a year via Alibaba, was the smallest in 3-1/2 years, up 5 percent from the previous quarter to 350 million. The group will continue investing in areas such as digital entertainment, cloud computing and mobile Internet, Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu told a conference call. Zhang will also take on decelerating profit growth. Alibaba\\'s net income excluding extraordinary and one-off items grew 16 percent year-on-year, a far cry from 48 percent growth the previous year and triple-digit gains in the 12 months before that. Alibaba\\'s quarterly revenue jumped 45 percent to $2.81 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $2.77 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares jumped 6.9 percent to $85.54 at midday in the U.S. trading session.\\n\\n\\nFacebook Launches In-App Purchase Install Ads: Facebook is combining its lucrative app install ads with deep linking so a specific in-app purchase page opens once the app downloads. The result is a powerful new tool for direct marketers that sell products and services through apps. Direct marketing is popular on the web where users can see an ad for a specific product and quickly open it in a new browser tab to make a purchase. But on mobile if a merchant sells through an app, it first must convince people to download their app, then hope customers follow through by digging into the app for the purchase highlighted by the ad. Facebook is now letting deep linking handle that last chore instead, which could increase conversion rates to the point that app install ads and direct marketing can be one and the same. I call these “in-app purchase install ads”, and they could help Facebook blow past the $3.32 billion in ad revenue it earned last quarter. Imagine a Facebook mobile News Feed ad for HotelTonight. The business doesn’t just want downloads. It wants people to buy hotel rooms that earn it a commission. So it targets an ad to people currently in Los Angeles who normally live in San Francisco– people likely to be on an impromptu trip to LA. Previously, HotelTonight could entice app installs by making its ad say “Get a hotel room tonight in New York City”. But if a user clicked through and downloaded the ad in hopes of booking one of those rooms, they’d have to search for New York City once the app installs. That’s a lot of effort, especially when it can take a minute or so to download apps. Users might get distracted, forget why they downloaded the app, or just be too lazy. In this case, HotelTonight may have paid to get an app install, but didn’t earn money from a sale. Now, HotelTonight could configure its in-app purchase install ad to immediately open the search results for tonight’s available rooms in NYC, or the purchase page for a particular room it thinks you’re likely to want. You don’t have to remember much or do extra work. You start much closer to purchase conversion, and HotelTonight is much more likely to earn a return on investment. Facebook already sells app re-engagment ads that drive people to specific pages inside apps they’ve already downloaded. These are often used to catalyze purchases in an app someone might not remember they even have on their device. But by merging this deep linking with the instant gratification and high conversion rates of app install ads, and the urgent calls to action of direct marketing, Facebook has spawned a different ad type all together.\\n\\n\\nWith Stock at 2-year Low on Weak Earnings, Yelp seeks a buyer - shares surge 16% on news: Yelp Inc. shares surged 16 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported the online-review website is exploring a sale. The company is working with investment bankers and has been in touch with potential buyers, the paper said, citing people familiar with the matter. Shares of the San Francisco-based company were halted after the report, and jumped to $44.48 after trading resumed. Last week, Yelp’s stock plummeted to its lowest level in almost two years after slipping ad sales raised concerns the company is losing its share of major advertisers. Yelp operates websites that let users search local businesses for free and read reviews about them. The company charges for advertising on those sites. It had 142 million unique monthly visitors in the first quarter, an increase of 7.6 percent from a year earlier. Yelp, which has a market value of about $3.3 billion, would be a good acquisition for Google Inc., Yahoo! Inc., Facebook Inc. or even travel sites such as Priceline Group Inc. and TripAdvisor Inc., said Kerry Rice, an analyst at Needham & Co. “They’ve done a great job building out local advertising and weaving together the small and medium business market, which is a really hard market to be successful in,” Rice said. “I think it’s going to have to be a hefty premium considering how high their stock price has been.”\\n\\n\\nGoogle, Dominant in Search, Tries Disruptor Role in Wireless and Broadband: In the stodgy wireless service industry, long dominated by AT&T and Verizon, with struggling Sprint and feisty T-Mobile a distant third and fourth, the possibility that a new competitor might upend this cozy oligopoly has long been considered a pipe dream. When the Justice Department sued to block the proposed merger of AT&T and T-Mobile in 2011, it concluded it was highly unlikely that other competitors would enter the market. Last year, Sprint abandoned its bid for T-Mobile after the Justice Department suggested that deal, too, would be anticompetitive. But now Google’s entry into wireless — named Project Fi — has changed the conversation about competition in that market, even though Google said the move was still an experiment. “I’m delighted that Google is doing this,” said Scott Hemphill, visiting professor of antitrust and intellectual property at New York University School of Law. “This is an industry that’s ripe for disruption.” Google’s wireless business certainly seems disruptive. It takes direct aim at the fat profit margins and high prices of the dominant firms. Google is charging $20 a month for basic voice and text service, and $10 for a gigabyte of cellular data, according to a blog post on the company’s website. And in a move unheard-of among traditional wireless providers, Google will rebate payments to customers for any unused data. Google’s service also uses a combination of innovative technology and partnerships with existing cellular providers to overcome its lack of wireless spectrum. Project Fi uses Wi-Fi networks whenever possible (hence its name) and, when Wi-Fi isn’t available, moves seamlessly to cellular networks. The cellular networks are provided by Sprint and T-Mobile, the current cell service underdogs. In the high-speed broadband market, even the prospect of Google’s coming to town has caused entrenched providers to improve their service in anticipation of a new competitive threat. After Google said it would bring its fiber service to the Charlotte, N.C., market, Time Warner Cable announced it was offering a free higher-speed upgrade to its customers there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook\\'s Oculus to sell virtual reality headsets for consumers from early 2016. Virtual reality technology company Oculus said it would start shipping the much-awaited consumer version of its Rift headset in the first quarter of 2016. Pre-orders for Rift will start later this year, Oculus, which Facebook Inc bought for $2 billion last year, said. Previous versions of the VR headset, available since 2012, were aimed at developers to make games and run tests. The consumer version was widely expected sometime this year. \"In the weeks ahead, we\\'ll be revealing the details around hardware, software, input, and many of our unannounced made-for-VR games and experiences coming to the Rift,\" the company said on a blog post.\\n\\n\\nApple Is Planning Another Big Bond Sale: Apple Inc. is planning to sell bonds in the iPhone maker’s fourth multi-billion dollar offering since 2013 as it borrows to return capital to shareholders while preserving its cash holdings abroad. The company will issue the securities in as many as seven parts today, with the longest-dated bonds maturing in 30 years, according to a person with knowledge of the offering. Proceeds will back stock repurchases, capital expenditures, acquisitions and debt repayment, said the person, who asked not to be identified because of a lack of authorization to speak publicly. Apple may sell the bonds due in 2045 at a yield of 1.5 percentage points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and 10-year notes at a 1.10 percentage-point premium, said the person. The company is also planning to issue fixed and floating-rate notes maturing in two and five years and a seven-year fixed-rate bond. The Cupertino, California-based company has issued the equivalent of $40.35 billion of bonds since April 2013, including the $17 billion it sold in what at the time was the biggest corporate-bond offering ever. The company may also sell its first yen bonds and has arranged a series of fixed-income investor calls starting Thursday, Goldman Sachs, one of the underwriters of that offering, said in an e-mailed statement. A sale would be the first in the Japanese currency for Apple, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\\n\\n\\nAffirm, consumer lending start-up raises $275M to lend to young borrowers using data science: Affirm is adding $275 million in debt and equity to accelerate its growth plans. The big Series B funding round is a vote of confidence by investors in one of the more ambitious entrants into the emerging field of financial technology. The firm is at the forefront of start-ups trying to use the new math of data science to more accurately assess credit risk than traditional scoring, which relies heavily on a person’s credit history. Conventional techniques, the new lenders say, do not do a good job of predicting the default risk on people with limited credit histories, like young people and recent immigrants. Traditional credit analysis tools, they add, tend to overly punish borrowers for single missteps such as a missed student loan payment or falling behind on medical debt. Affirm is building its business by focusing on lending to the millennial market, those under 35 years of age. They tend to have thin credit histories, and surveys show they generally have a lowly opinion of banks. “We’re building a financial technology company for the next generation,” said Max Levchin, the chief executive of Affirm, who was a co-founder of PayPal. To date, Affirm’s main product is a credit-card alternative for online merchants — installment loans from three months to a year. To seek a loan, an applicant provides a few items of personal information — name, cellphone number, birth date and the last four digits of the person’s Social Security number. Then, Affirm’s algorithms pore through all kinds of data from credit bureau reports to social networks. Affirm’s technology makes the underwriting decision almost immediately. More than 100 online merchants have signed up with Affirm, which has made more than $100 million in loans. Merchants using Affirm, the company says, report 20 percent higher sales, reflecting the appeal of Affirm’s alternative to credit cards. The tryout phase for the two-year-old company’s technology, Mr. Levchin said, is over. “We’ve come of age, so we want to have the resources to expand,” he said. New products, Mr. Levchin said, are part of the plan, including a credit-card offering.\\n\\n\\nSAP Takes SuccessFactors and Concur to the Cloud: The new integration is being offered as a sort of “multi-tenant” business, akin to the public clouds of Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, only for a set of fewer, but more high-level, functions. What that means is that it will be possible for customers of SAP, along with independent software developers, to make software applications that can take data from different elements of their business and build new kinds of information services. Both Ariba and SuccessFactors were independent online software companies that SAP purchased to hasten its transition from selling packaged software to a rental model. The features and data from another SAP acquisition, Concur, which does travel procurement and management, will also be integrated into S4 in the near future.  Cloud-based revenue in the first quarter of the year was about $564 million, up 129 percent from a year ago. That was still a relative sliver of the $5 billion in total revenue the company scored, but total revenue was up 22 percent.\\n\\n\\nIndia Start-up Action: Logistic services firm Delhivery raises $85M to ride on India’s ecommerce boom: Riding on the back of an ecommerce boom, India-based logistics service Delhivery raised a series D round of US$85 million led by Tiger Global Management. Last year, the company received US$35 million from Multiples Alternate Asset Management, Nexus Venture Partners, and Times Internet Limited. These investors have also participated in this round. This has so far been the biggest deal for an ecommerce support venture in India. Delhivery has a range of proprietary commerce technologies that they’ve built in-house to tackle logistics problems. The company has over 10,000 employees in more than 200 cities along with nearly a million square feet of warehousing space in 11 fulfilment centers. It handles over 3 million monthly transactions for 70,000 merchants and 1,500 ecommerce companies. With the funding, it plans to tap into India’s rural market and build 2.5 million square feet fulfilment centers. The startup aims to expand its reach four-fold. Delhivery is also expected to invest heavily in expanding the senior management team. It has recently appointed Sandeep Barasia, senior partner of Bain and Company and Suraju Dutta, ex-FedEx executive, as managing directors.\\n\\n\\nIBM and Facebook in Marketing Partnership: Personalized marketing — the product pitch or message that really hits its target, the right person at the right time — is the much-discussed ideal in advertising and sales. The truth is that personalized marketing is, well, mostly marketing today. With modern tools of data analysis, it is becoming increasingly possible to identify customer groups in smaller segments than the big demographic buckets of the past, which filtered by age, gender, income and place of residence. But smaller audiences are still a long way from personalized marketing. On Wednesday, IBM and Facebook are announcing a partnership to take a step closer to the ideal. The partnership stems from how the companies bring complementary strengths to the lucrative business of data-fueled marketing. IBM’s data analytics business caters to major retailers and big consumer product brands. And Facebook, the social networking giant, does too. IBM’s data scientists do a lot of social media and sentiment analysis, but not with the vast laboratory of human behavior and preferences that Facebook has. The partnership is intended to combine data that marketers have on customers — like purchase behavior, responses to a marketer’s email campaigns and call center inquiries — with Facebook data including likes, comments and complaints. IBM’s data analytics will then be used to help big brands find and communicate with more finely targeted audiences on Facebook. Mr. Chandlee called this “personalization at scale.” And the insights gleaned from analyzing Facebook and other data should also help companies better target consumers in other marketing channels, such as ads on the web and email programs. Facebook will also be the first company to join IBM’s new Commerce ThinkLab. The new lab is a collaborative setting for applied research involving teams from major consumer brands and retailers, IBM industry experts and data scientists, and teams from Facebook as well. For IBM, the Facebook partnership is the most recent alliance the enterprise technology company has forged with consumer-focused technology companies, notably Apple and Twitter .\\n\\n\\nTwo Retail Veterans Take Aim at Amazon’s E-Commerce Reign: In the last few months, two retail veterans have been working on companies that explore these different avenues of breaking into online commerce. Ron Johnson, who, with Steve Jobs, created Apple’s lucrative physical stores, has been working on something out of left field — a selective online store called Enjoy, which, for no additional cost, will send an expert to hand-deliver tech products and spend an hour helping people set up and learn to use their new things. The service, Mr. Johnson said, is a smartphone-era take on his past at Apple — an effort to create the friendliness of an Apple Store in people’s homes and offices. Then there’s Marc Lore, an e-commerce veteran who in 2010 sold his company, Quidsi, to Amazon for about $550 million. Mr. Lore’s new service, Jet.com, represents a frontal assault on Amazon. Mr. Lore has raised more than $200 million — a staggering sum before even opening up shop — to create a nationwide e-commerce giant to compete with Amazon on selection, service and, especially, price. Jet’s promise is simple and, if the company can keep it, potentially momentous: to offer the absolute lowest price on just about everything, from paper towels to oatmeal to tennis rackets, guaranteed. Enjoy is starting small. The company, which has raised around $30 million from investors, is starting out in just the San Francisco Bay Area this week and in New York City next Wednesday. Enjoy does not compete with Amazon on selection; it offers only about a dozen or so high-margin tech products for sale, among them laptops, GoPros, drones and, in an exclusive deal, smartphones and tablets purchased from AT&T. Mr. Johnson believes that by limiting selection, Enjoy can offer free delivery and setup. Because it only needs to stock high-end products, the company hopes to squeeze enough out of each purchase to cover delivery and personal consultation. Enjoy is in stark contrast with Jet, which, when it opens to the public in early July, does not aim to start small. Right out of the gate, it makes a huge promise: “You should never find an item that’s more expensive on Jet than anywhere else,” Mr. Lore told me this week. Mr. Lore says he believes he can keep that promise thanks to an unusual business model. Like Costco, Jet will charge an annual membership fee, in this case $49.99. That fee is intended to free Mr. Lore from making any profit on each item — and thus pass all potential savings to customers. Right now, Jet is working well enough to bolster Mr. Lore’s basic claim — on dozens of items I searched for, Jet was cheaper, sometimes unbelievably so, than Amazon, Walmart or anywhere else online. For instance, a 40-pack of Duracell AA batteries on Amazon sells for $16.99. On Jet, the same pack is $13.70. If you add more items to your cart, Jet reduces the cost further. So, by ordering the batteries as part of a larger cart, I cut the price down to just under $11, about a third less than Amazon’s price. I noticed this effect on multiple orders across a wide range of household staples I usually order, from cooking oil to aluminum foil to shampoo to baby diapers. Jet’s sticker prices are low, but when I created large carts, the prices shrank even more. My child’s diapers, ordered in bulk, cost me 21 cents each, compared with 29 cents at Amazon. Still, there are some disadvantages: Jet’s fastest items ship in two days, slower than Amazon’s next- or same-day shipping, and a huge number of its goods ship in three to five days. It also does not offer an Amazon Prime-like free shipping service; you pay $5.99 for all orders under $35, after which your order ships free. These limitations suggest that Jet is going after an audience that’s different from Amazon’s — one that is less affluent, less hooked on impulse buying and more interested in discounts. “For most households, the proposition of paying $50 to Jet and saving $200 for the year, that’s a no-brainer thing,” Mr. Lore said. Over the holidays, Amazon sold a record $29.3 billion in merchandise, more than many large e-commerce companies combined. But Americans spent around $1.2 trillion in the same period, meaning that Amazon accounted for just 2 percent of our purchases. In other words, there’s lots of room for new ways to get Americans shopping online.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAhead of Earnings, Alibaba\\'s Shares are at Post-IPO Low, Even as Rivals JD, Tencent have Surged: After Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. raised a record $25 billion last year, founder Jack Ma said the Chinese e-commerce company faced the danger of high expectations. He might be right. About $70 billion of market value has evaporated since Ma made that statement in November as investors worry about slowing growth. Alibaba’s dominance at home as a marketplace for buyers and sellers of goods is being undermined by a Chinese economy projected to grow at the slowest pace since 1990 and a consumer shift to mobile shopping that crimps advertising revenue. While investors have punished Alibaba, an index of U.S.- traded Chinese companies has jumped by 17 percent this year. Rival e-commerce operators have also surged with JD.com Inc. rising 46 percent in New York and Tencent Holdings Ltd. gaining 40 percent in Hong Kong through Tuesday. The two companies have joined forces to compete against Alibaba. Tencent is trying to drive the 1 billion users of its WeChat and QQ chat apps to JD.com, which recently started a service to speed imports to Chinese buyers. As JD.com, China’s second-biggest e-commerce company, “ups its game,” said Mark Tanner, founder of China Skinny, a Shanghai-based research and marketing agency, Alibaba’s previous growth “seems unsustainable in the medium term.” Ma’s push outside China also has yet to gain traction -- its presence in the U.S. and much of Europe remains negligible. Results due Thursday are expected to show that the pace of Alibaba’s revenue expansion fell below the average of the previous seven quarters. Shares of Alibaba closed Tuesday at $79.54 in New York, 33 percent below their November peak and the lowest since the Hangzhou-based company sold stock at $68 apiece in its initial public offering in September. Alibaba currently gets less than 5 percent of its revenue from outside China, Ma said in March on a company Twitter account. Alibaba’s sales probably rose 41 percent in the fourth quarter to 16.9 billion yuan ($2.7 billion), according to the average of 23 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with an average of about 50 percent during the past seven quarters. The company’s strategy of expanding in under-served regions of China and overseas is driving up marketing costs as more consumers shop on mobile devices, where ads typically generate less revenue than those on desktop computers. Operating income will probably shrink 18 percent to 4.5 billion yuan, according to the estimates.\\n\\n\\nBrand Safety and Twitter\\'s Porn Problem: Twitter Scrambles for an Ad Fix as Nielsen\\'s Promoted Tweets Show Up in Porn Feeds TV company pulled its campaign today. Twitter has a porn problem, and it caused one brand to temporarily halt a campaign today. Nielsen, the television and digital data company, pulled the plug on its Promoted Tweets after they appeared near adult content on the site.  Nielsen\\'s promos showed up on Twitter profile pages called \"Daily Dick Pictures\" and \"Homemade Porn.\" Ads are not supposed to appear on a profile page if X-rated content is posted there, and a bug was to blame, a source familiar with Twitter\\'s technology said. \"As Twitter works to resolve this issue, we have temporarily suspended our campaign,\" a Nielsen spokesman told Adweek. Nielsen was not alone, either. Marketers\\' promos from Duane Reade, NBCUniversal and Gatorade also showed up in feeds of pornographic photos and videos. Brand safety is an issue across the digital advertising ecosystem, where it is difficult to police every website and social media post. Twitter rivals like YouTube and Facebook also have dealt with racy or offensive content that concerned advertisers. Twitter is in a particularly tough position—it has to monitor 300 million active accounts filled with user-generated content—and its troubles with not-safe-for-work material have been raised before. The San Francisco tech company has been trying to clean up its site—not just accounts that share NSFW pictures, but also those that support terrorism or harass other users. It recently introduced a quality filter that removes abusive or offensive tweets from a user\\'s timeline. But just last week, Robert Peck, a SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst, wrote a report warning that Twitter ads were appearing near pornography and that brands would pull back on spending if the problem became more widely known. Peck estimated there could be as many as 10 million Twitter accounts dedicated to sharing pornography and that Twitter needs to do a better job of blocking them.\\n\\n\\nAftermath of Secret\\'s Shutdown: Google Ventures Managing Partner Criticizes Founders for \\'Taking Money Off the Table\\': For many in Silicon Valley, the rapid rise and precipitous fall of Secret, the prominent start-up that recently closed its doors, will most likely serve as a cautionary tale of how not to run a company. For Google Ventures, one of Secret’s earliest backers, it will also be a reminder of the type of company not to invest in. The product of two former Google employees, David Byttow and Chrys Bader, Secret attracted intense media interest early in its life. The app let users anonymously share “secrets” to their network of close friends and friends of friends, an activity that quickly caught on among founders, investors and the media of Silicon Valley. It also helped that Secret took some early rounds of funding from Google Ventures and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, two big venture capital firms. After the flurry of attention and just a few months later, Secret opted to raise another round of financing, this time seeking $25 million. Bill Maris, managing partner of Google Ventures, did not think it was a good idea and the company did not participate. “We advised them against it,” Mr. Maris said in an interview, referring to Secret’s leaders. “We told them they didn’t need the money. And raising that much money that soon, it was going to be impossible to meet the expectations in the future.” The discussion could be considered a case of life imitating art, or perhaps vice versa: In a recent episode of Silicon Valley, the satirical HBO series, a young start-up founder is offered millions of dollars from multiple venture capital firms at high valuations. Ultimately, the founder is advised to instead accept a lower offer, in order to make future funding rounds more achievable and growth targets reasonable. That is not what the founders of Secret chose to do. The company completed its $25 million financing led by Index Ventures and Redpoint Ventures, along with a variety of individual angel investors. In that round, the two founders each wanted to take $3 million off the table for themselves, a practice that is commonplace for more mature companies, but less so for very young start-ups. Not joining the $25 million round proved to be a wise choice for Google Ventures. Downloads of Secret declined over 2014, according to App Annie, an app analytics service. Secret redesigned its entire app to look like a near-perfect clone of Yik Yak, a competing service, but traffic did not improve. Many employees, including Mr. Bader, left the company. Last week, Mr. Byttow said he was shutting down his company, and would return the remainder of the money to the venture capital firms. Neither Mr. Byttow nor Mr. Bader have said if that includes the $6 million the two of them took off the table and deposited into their bank accounts.\\n\\n\\nIn 2014 Jabong’s GMV grew 2.5x to Rs1320Cr; Ended Year with INR 289 Crore Cash; Lost INR 454 Crore on EBITDA Basis: Rocket Internet-incubated lifestyle e-tailer Jabong.com more than doubled its gross merchandise value (GMV) to Rs 1,320.6 crore during the calender year ended December 31, 2014. The firm’s GMV captures value of total transactions, excluding taxes and shipping costs but including value of paid vouchers and coupons. The firm had ended 2013 with GMV of Rs 511.4 crore, data pulled from its latest annual statistics show. The data is net of returns and cancellations. Jabong shipped 8.7 million orders last year of which 5.9 million transactions represented products sold by Jabong while another 2.8 million orders or close to one in three orders were through its marketplace. This means the firm handled on an average 23,835 orders a day last year as compared to 16,164 in 2013. The company’s net revenues (which captures the sales by the firm as against GMV which includes sales by third party vendors too, for which the company just gets a listing fee) grew 2.3x to Rs 811.4 crore last year. Meanwhile, its loss at an operating level as captured by EBITDA (adjusted for share based compensation) rose to Rs 454 crore as against Rs 236 crore in 2013. This means, for every Re 1 worth of sales it books directly (not covering third party vendors), it is losing around 56 paisa. This is still an improvement over the previous year when it was booking operating loss of over two thirds (68.5 per cent) of whatever it sold. The firm did see its cash position dwindle as a result ending 2014 with Rs 289.4 crore as against Rs 853.2 crore the previous year.\\n\\n\\nHome Depot Aiming to Put Apple Pay in Its 2,000 Stores: Home Depot Inc. has the goal of offering Apple Inc.’s mobile-payment platform at its more than 2,000 stores, which would make it the largest retailer yet to accept Apple Pay. Customers already were able to use Apple Pay at some of Home Depot’s stores despite there not being an agreement. The world’s largest home-improvement retailer could accept mobile payments at those locations because its checkout terminals have near-field communication readers. Those devices have now been turned off for the past few weeks during an upgrade of its point-of-sale system, Holmes said. That led to some inaccurate reports that Home Depot had dropped Apple Pay. If it pushes ahead with the plan, Home Depot would join chains like Macy’s Inc. and Whole Foods Market Inc. in embracing Apple Pay at stores. Many other retailers are betting on a mobile-payment option from the Merchant Customer Exchange, which was founded in 2012 by companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp. That offering, CurrentC, is still being developed.\\n\\n\\n3-D Printing Is Saving the Italian Artisan: Italy’s craftsmen turn to a new tool in their competition with cheap products from China. Northeast Italy’s industrial heartland stretches roughly from Milan to Venice, along the floodplains of the Po River all the way to the Adriatic.  Like much of the rest of the country, however, the region has fallen on hard times. Italy’s craftsmen have been undermined by competition from China and other parts of Asia. Since the beginning of the global economic crisis, the northeast’s industrial sector has shed about 135,000 jobs—some 17 percent of its total workforce. Techniques such as the 3D printing used by Pomini and Armani have helped turn northeastern Italy into an unlikely hothouse of innovation. Last year growth in the region was positive for the first time since 2007, at 0.5 percent. Exports rose by 3.5 percent in 2014 and are expected to keep climbing. In the province of Trento, for instance, the public and private sectors together invest some 2\\u202fpercent of gross domestic product in research and development. At the Centro Moda Canossa—a trade school in Trento for children age 14 to 18 specializing in fashion design and tailoring—the faculty recently added a class in which students incorporate 3D printing, laser cutting, and microcontroller chips into their designs. “You can’t offer a job from the past. Nobody will come,” says Michele Bommassar, 36, the school’s vice director. “You have to offer the jobs of the future.” He points to a student project, a purse with a laser-cut pattern on its flap and an interior that lights up when it’s opened: “It’s beautiful, but we believe it is also necessary. The alternative\\u202fis to be eaten by others.” At their best, these technologies inject elements of the digital economy into the physical world, allowing a galaxy of small companies to compete with multinationals, in much the same way homemade YouTube videos hold their own against traditional video production. The advent of rapid prototyping and other innovations means “you can compensate for your disadvantages with variety, customization, and a rapid response to what the market is demanding,” says Paolo Collini, a business professor and the dean of the University of Trento. Or, as Armani puts it: “If something doesn’t work, you simply stop producing. You haven’t filled a warehouse. For a designer, it’s a dream. You can take more risks.”\\n\\n\\nSalesforce shares spike on report of Microsoft evaluating bid: Shares of Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N) jumped as much as 6.4 percent on Tuesday after a Bloomberg report that Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) was evaluating a bid for the cloud software provider. Salesforce shares rose from $71.4 to $75.82 in about a minute late Tuesday afternoon, after which trading was temporarily halted. The stock closed 1.6 percent higher at $72.75. Microsoft shares closed down 1.3 percent at $47.60. Microsoft is evaluating a bid after Salesforce was approached by another potential buyer, Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter. Microsoft is not in talks with Salesforce, and no deal is imminent, the report said.  Bloomberg had reported last week that Salesforce was working with financial advisers to help it field takeover offers after being approached by a potential buyer. The news sent the company\\'s shares up as much as 17.3 percent to an all-time high of $78.46 last Wednesday.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nForeshadowing Tensions Between Hollywood and Tech, Twitter’s Periscope Disabled Dozens of Mayweather Fight Streams: Twitter Inc. said its Periscope streaming business scrambled Saturday night to take down users’ unauthorized live feeds of the championship boxing match between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. “Members of the Periscope team were on staff Saturday night working to disable streams of the fight,” Twitter said Monday in a statement. “We were able to respond to takedown requests within minutes.” The year’s biggest fight cost $100 to see live on pay-per-view television from Time Warner Inc.’s HBO and CBS Corp.’s Showtime. Some fans used their phones to capture the video and stream it to Periscope and a competing service, Meerkat. Twitter executives including Chief Executive Officer Dick Costolo appeared to boast of Periscope’s use, creating the impression they supported the copyright-violating streams. Periscope was trying to stop the streams, according to Twitter. The company received 66 reports from the rights holders, and took action on 30, it said today in a statement. The others either had ended already or weren’t available. “Our content policy expressly prohibits streaming content that is protected by copyright. This kind of use constitutes a clear violation,” San Francisco-based Twitter said. “We are working to ensure that there are robust tools in place that allow us to react expeditiously.” The use of Periscope on big televised events threatens to exacerbate longstanding friction between Hollywood and tech companies over piracy. In April, fans of HBO’s “Game of Thrones” streamed the show on Periscope and Meerkat, giving people who weren’t paying access to a grainy video rebroadcast. While Saturday’s streams are unlikely to dent the millions made by HBO and Showtime, the event signals a potential problem if more people use live-streaming apps to watch pay TV. Twitters investors and executives helped contribute to that perception with tweets on Saturday night. Costolo pronounced Periscope the fight’s winner, while Twitter investor Chris Sacca, also proclaimed Periscope a winner “by a knockout.” Sacca clarified those remarks with subsequent posts on Sunday, lauding the use of Periscope for behind-the-scenes footage by Showtime, HBO and Yahoo Sports. He also said: “1) The Scope team shut down countless streams last night 2) Scope was awesome second screen/behind the scenes.”\\n\\n\\nTech-centric Elementary School Chain Raises $100M from Zuckerberg, Others: Add an elementary school to the list of ventures attracting nine-figure sums from Silicon Valley investors. AltSchool, a chain of technology-centric private schools in San Francisco, has raised $100 million from Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, through his family\\'s charitable organization, as well as from Founders Fund, Andreessen Horowitz, and other backers. Founded by former Google executive Max Ventilla, AltSchool has been developing customized hardware and software that it says allows teachers to create more personalized education plans. Instead of having children follow the same curriculum throughout the year, lesson plans can be tailored to each student. Tuition costs about $21,000 a year, and the company eventually plans to sell its technology to other schools. \"Everything is instrumented through technology,\" Ventilla says. Tech investors have been pouring money into education-related companies. Spending on education startups last year increased 55 percent, to a record $1.87 billion, according to CB Insights, which tracks venture capital spending. In 1999, when the researcher started tracking education, financing within the industry was $385 million. AltSchool is different from many other education-tech companies, which typically build applications to help with math or reading. That\\'s because it operates its own schools. The company started last year in a single San Francisco classroom with 20 students. This year, it plans to have eight schools serving 500 kids. Its first school outside of California will open later this year in—where else—Brooklyn, N.Y. After Ventilla sold his search startup, Aardvark, in 2010 to Google, where he worked until 2013, he became increasingly interested in what he describes as a failing education system in the U.S. The country ranks 14th—below Russia and other developed nations—in a Pearson study on global math, science, reading, literacy and graduation rates. One reason for that is a lack of funding for public schools, something Ventilla\\'s hot tech startup no longer needs to worry about.\\n\\n\\nStartup Works to Translate Videos Into Structured Data: Vu Digital is launching new technology to help customers figure out what’s actually going on inside web online videos. B. Wade Smith, the company’s vice president of operations and development, said that as more and more online content moves to video, it will become increasingly important to extract data about those videos in a form that’s easy to analyze — namely, text. So as Smith demonstrated for me, Vu Digital’s Video-to-Data product actually breaks down a video frame-by-frame, identifies the objects in each frame, and then creates a chronological transcript identifying things like music, dialogue, faces, logos, text and graphics. What’s the point? Smith suggested this could be used by “anyone in the video value chain,” such as creators, publishers or marketers. The data could used for things like search engine optimization, personalization, ad targeting, and determining the “brand value” of a video, namely how long and how prominently a product or logo appeared. Smith admitted that the current product comes from a pivot, but a pivot that illustrates the problem Vu Digital is trying to solve. The company started out focused on web personalization, but Smith said, “We quickly found more and more website content was becoming video and we couldn’t make long tail content recommendations — the tags for the video were absolutely insufficient.” So the team decided to “drop everything” and focus on the video issue. Other companies have built video analysis and search tools — in fact, Microsoft acquired its own video search company back in 2011. However, Smith said he’s not aware of any competitors that can identify everything that Vu Digital can, nor can competitors do it with the product’s speed.\\n\\n\\nGenerational Shift at Cisco as longtime CEO John Chambers Steps Down: On Monday, perhaps the last veteran leader of the old guard signaled it was time to leave the corner office — if only for a move down the hall. John T. Chambers, chief executive of Cisco Systems since 1995, said he was stepping down effective July 26, to be succeeded by a longtime Cisco sales executive. “He is the last of the lions, presiding over years of incredible growth,” said George Colony, chief executive of Forrester Research, a market research firm. Cisco makes much of the gear that runs the Internet, notably digital information switches. It also supplies equipment for the world’s telecommunications infrastructure, and for teleconferencing, video and Wi-Fi networks. It had sales of $47.1 billion in the 2014 fiscal year, compared with $1.2 billion in 1994, just before Mr. Chambers took over. Mr. Chambers’s successor, Charles H. Robbins, is 49, and joined Cisco, the networking equipment maker, in 1997, just two years after Mr. Chambers became C.E.O. Mr. Chambers, 65, will remain as executive chairman. The company said that Mr. Chambers would spend time supporting the company’s new chief and “engaging closely with customers and governments around the world.” The transition is another sign of a generational shift in Silicon Valley. In September, Lawrence J. Ellison announced he would leave the C.E.O. position at Oracle, the world’s largest maker of database software. Like Mr. Chambers, Mr. Ellison became the company’s executive chairman and remains active. In August 2013, Steven A. Ballmer said he would step down as head of Microsoft, and he was succeeded in February 2014 by Satya Nadella. Unlike Mr. Ellison or Mr. Chambers, Mr. Ballmer cut his ties with Microsoft and left the board in August. He now gives commands from the courtside of the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team, which he purchased for $2 billion in May 2014. In addition, just months before Mr. Ballmer announced his decision to step down as Microsoft chief, there was a passing of the guard at the chip maker Intel, with Brian M. Krzanich becoming chief executive to succeed Paul S. Otellini. The year before, in 2012, Virginia M. Rometty took the place vacated by Samuel J. Palmisano as head of IBM. Even as the executive suites at these large companies have turned over, a web-focused and mobile-proficient group of companies now dominate the technology scene, including Facebook and Google. Many of these are run by much younger leaders than Mr. Chambers, especially Google’s Larry Page, 42, and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, 30. Their companies have powerful networks but are primarily devoted to software, and an ethos that information should be ubiquitous and shared. “Now it’s a young man’s game,” Mr. Colony said.\\n\\n\\nWith Big Names and Money Flowing In, Tech Start-Ups in India Heat Up: Intense interest from prominent investors is helping to drive eye-popping valuations among Indian tech start-ups. Venture capital firms, hedge funds and the likes of business executives such as Rupert Murdoch are all vying for a piece of India’s rapidly growing e-commerce market — particularly companies aimed at the growing number of aspiring middle-class consumers. It is a radical turnaround from just a few years ago, when fewer smartphones, a smaller number of Internet users, general government inertia and a lack of funding hampered many entrepreneurs and start-ups. Well-known investors like Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of SoftBank; Jack Ma, the executive chairman of Alibaba; and Mr. Murdoch, the media tycoon, have all made investments in India’s e-commerce companies. They are going head-to-head with other experienced tech investors like Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners. Mr. Son said he would pump $10 billion into India, joking during a visit that he was “speed dating” entrepreneurs to gauge their passion. Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, posed on a festooned truck holding a $2 billion check to be invested in the company’s India unit. India’s market potential is enticing. Only 300 million Indians, or less than 25 percent of the country, are Internet users, and while that is already the second-largest Internet market in the world, after China, five million users are added each month, according to Rajan Anandan, Google India’s managing director. The number of Internet users in India is expected to reach 500 million in three years, he said. As investors rush in, the stampede has brought its own set of challenges. Despite the optimism, none of India’s e-commerce players are profitable yet. For now, it is a game of capturing market share, and the expenses are high as rivals try to distinguish themselves in front-page newspaper ads and prime-time TV commercials. There is also the matter of the aggressive valuations that start-up founders are demanding. News reports this year suggested that a deal between Alibaba and Snapdeal fell through because the two could not agree on a valuation. With such inflated prices, investors ought to be wary. Any downturn could take with it hundreds of millions of dollars of their money. “Follow-on financing offers land even before entrepreneurs have closed the previous round. It is a little chaotic,” said Shailendra Singh, managing partner at Sequoia Capital in India, which has investments in the cab-summoning app Ola and the restaurant and food platform Zomato. Investors get sticker shock as entrepreneurs demand outrageous multiples and stiff premiums. Mr. Singh said some demands were “uncomfortably high.” Still, the investor interest and money are being aggressively put to use by start-ups like Flipkart, which has tripled its number of employees in one year, to 33,000 as of March. It says it has averaged eight million shipments a month (compared with three million a year ago). It recently hired two Silicon Valley-based Google executives: Punit Soni, as its chief product officer, and Peeyush Ranjan, as its head of engineering. Both will be based in Bangalore, where Google has leased 1.5 million square feet for its new campus in an office park backed by the Blackstone Group, the private equity firm. Already, the value of goods sold on Snapdeal — which offers goods as varied as bulletproof cars and luggage made in Mumbai’s slums — exceeds that of India’s largest offline retailers, said Mr. Bahl, its co-founder. Experts see India’s e-commerce market at an inflection point. A recent Morgan Stanley report titled “The Next India” said Indian e-commerce would expand to $100 billion in revenue by 2020, from $2.9 billion in 2013, making it the world’s fastest-growing market. India’s youthful market makes it an e-commerce sweet spot, said Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of India’s largest mobile payments platform, Paytm. As in China, India’s smaller cities and towns lack retail infrastructure. In 5,000 cities and towns, tapping an app is the new equivalent of a visit to the mall, and it could unleash pent-up demand for the latest fashion or the newest device. India resembles China of seven to 10 years ago in its broadband Internet growth, creation of digital-native marketplaces and rapid user adoption. Even ideas like online grocers, which have just started to gain a foothold in places like Silicon Valley could do well in India. “So investors who won in China are playing in India. Those who missed in China, too, are playing in India. This is the land of opportunity,” Mr. Gururaj said.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",
      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\nJet.com First Look: Prices Are Fantastic but Amazon Prime Shoppers Won’t Switch Over: Over the past year, yet-to-launch shopping site Jet.com has garnered a lot of attention for the gobs of investment dollars it has procured and the radically unique discounting model it’s building. Jet sells a $50 annual membership, a la Costco, which it says gives its members access to the best prices anywhere on the Web. CEO Marc Lore, who had started Diapers.com and eventually sold it to Amazon, has told Re/code that the company will make its profit from membership fees. That will free the company up to offer the lowest prices online by discounting its products with the commission fees it gets from the partnering retailers that sell stuff through Jet’s marketplace. But up until this week, there was no way for most people to know whether the site worked as promised. Two days ago, Jet.com gave me access ahead of yesterday’s private launch to 10,000 people who had signed up early. I played around with the site for a few hours, which was enough time to get a feel for how it worked and to do some price comparisons. It’s important to note that this is a first look, and that Re/code’s stellar reviews team will likely do a thorough review in the coming months. That said, here are a few thoughts. I compared prices between Jet and Amazon, and Jet won. But let’s get this out of the way at the start: It’s going to be very hard for Jet to convert Amazon Prime members to Jet membership. There are several reasons why I think Prime members, who pay $99 a year for membership, will stay put. First, Amazon sells hundreds of millions of products in the U.S. Jet sells five million products today and will offer 10 million by the time it launches publicly later this spring, according to Lore. Secondly, one of the beauties of Prime is there’s no delivery minimum, so if you only need one $20 product, you don’t have to worry about adding more products to your shopping cart to reach the free-shipping threshold. Jet’s free-shipping minimum is $35 and it charges $5.99 for orders under that threshold. Also, many Prime members don’t do much price comparing because they trust they’re getting a fair deal. They also value the two-day guaranteed delivery time that comes with Prime. Some Jet.com products — like diapers, toilet paper and cereal — will be delivered in one to two days. Other stuff, like clothes and electronics, will take two to five days to arrive. There are also additional Prime perks that Jet isn’t matching: Free same-day delivery in a growing number of cities; a large selection of free movies and TV shows to stream; and free photo storage, among other things. Lore says all of this is fine with him because there’s still more than $200 billion of online shopping sales at stake in the U.S., even when you exclude sales made on Amazon. Additionally, Jet offers savings of anywhere from eight cents more on the soap to $19.98 on the TV if I waived my right to return the item. This is a feature I haven’t seen on any other major shopping site. What’s more, Jet will deduct another quarter of a percent for paying with a Visa or MasterCard credit card or 1.5 percent if you pay with a Visa or MasterCard debit card. There’s no discount if you pay with American Express. Again, this is a unique discounting structure I haven’t seen elsewhere on large shopping sites. My experience above shows that Jet, at least now, is living up to its pricing hype. But a lot will depend on whether this discounting strategy is really sustainable and how aggressively other retailers try to match it. It’s also too early to tell whether Jet will honor its delivery times and how good its customer service will be, too.\\n\\n\\nTencent shares surged to an all-time high this month after the operator of the WeChat messaging service posted a jump in online advertising revenue. Hong Kong equities rose to levels not seen in seven years, boosted by Chinese investors buying through the Shanghai trading link. “Tencent’s valuation may look expensive but it’s still acceptable compared with peers in the mainland,” said Sam Chi Yung, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Delta Asia Securities Ltd. “They have new opportunities such as advertising on WeChat as well as e-commerce initiatives that may become growth engines.” Tencent advanced 43 percent this year and traded at 50 times trailing earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. On the mainland, tech stocks have soared, with valuations at an average 211 times reported profits. That compares with an average multiple of 156 for U.S. companies on the Nasdaq Composite Index in March 2000. Tencent posted record net income of 23.8 billion yuan ($3.8 billion) for 2014 as Chairman Ma Huateng found new ways to make money from instant messaging and online gaming through advertising and payment services. Profit is expected to increase to 29.9 billion yuan this year and 38.4 billion yuan in 2016, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Tencent released an operating system for smartphones and smartwatches Tuesday that provides voice recognition and includes payment systems. It’s been steering shoppers to partner JD.com Inc. and expanding its game lineup to compete with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Tencent is trying to reach more users with deals to stream content such as HBO’s “Game of Thrones” and to make WeChat among the first applications integrated with Apple Inc.’s smartwatch.\\n\\n\\nIHS: Apple Inc\\'s Watch has the lowest ratio of hardware costs to retail price across any Apple phone, according to a preliminary estimate by research firm IHS after a teardown study. The hardware cost of an Apple Watch Sport model was about 24 percent of the suggested retail price compared with 29-38 percent for the iPhone maker\\'s other products, IHS said on Thursday. (bit.ly/1zuOZMq) The Apple Watch Sport 38 mm costs $349 and the teardown shows a bill of materials of $81.20 with the cost of production rising to $83.70 when $2.50 in manufacturing expense is added, IHS said. Preliminary estimate shows Apple Watch Sport hardware costs only about 24 percent of MSRP; lowest of any Apple product examined by IHS There are several new features and manufacturing methods used in the Apple Watch Sport, including: a Pulse Oximeter, Force Touch sensor, \"Taptic Engine\" feedback, encapsulated modular printed circuit board (PCB) assembly and stacked-die integrated circuits (IC). “While these features have been promoted by Apple and none are necessarily revelatory,” Keller said. “It is noteworthy that many features are appearing for the first time – in combination – in one device. It could be a bellwether for other future Apple products.”\\n\\n\\nTesla’s Home Battery Announcement is a big deal: The coming revolution in energy storage: Late Thursday, the glitzy electric car company Tesla Motors, run by billionaire Elon Musk, ceased to be just a car company. As was widely expected, Tesla announced that it is offering a home battery product, which people can use to store energy from their solar panels or to backstop their homes against blackouts, and also larger scale versions that could perform similar roles for companies or even parts of the grid. Late Thursday, Tesla unveiled a suite of new battery products for homes, business, and even utility scale applications. The home product, dubbed the Tesla Powerwall, will store either 10 kilowatt-hours worth of energy (for $ 3,500) or 7 kilowatt-hours (for $3,000). Importantly, though, these costs do not include the cost of installing the battery or the cost of a power inverter, meaning that what a customer actually pays could be substantially more. The company says it will start to deliver the batteries in “late summer.” For those closely following developments in the energy storage space, there are two key details here that are worth considering — the cost of the battery itself, and what it would actually mean to have 10 kilowatt-hours of backup energy or energy storage in your home.When it comes to price, these numbers are hardly cheap, but they’re also lower than some analysts were suggesting — figures like $13,000 were common in press coverage prior to Tesla’s announcement. “The price points of the two Powerwall options for residential and small commercial segments will surely give minor jolts to the industry,” Ravi Manghani, an analyst with GTM Research, said in a statement. The prices are “slightly lower than what the world has come to expect of an expensive electric vehicle manufacturer. This announcement is expected to result in similarly aggressive price offers by other storage technology and system vendors.” So there are a lot of details about the energy storage future that need to be worked out, especially as the market continues to grow. But for today, Tesla definitely seems to have gotten people pretty excited.\\n\\n\\nAfter a Decade of Running Shy, Start-Ups Try to Challenge Google, at Least on Mobile Search: After a decade in which entrepreneurs and investors steered clear of Google’s home turf, venture capitalists have plowed hundreds of millions of dollars into dozens of search start-ups because they say they believe the Internet giant cannot dominate search on mobile devices the way it has on personal computers. “There has been no great solution for mobile search,” Mr. Lo said. Venture capitalists financed 27 search companies in 2014 and 33 the year before — the two most active years on record, according to CB Insights, whose data on the venture capital industry goes back to 1999. The biggest jump has been in mobile search companies, according to a report CB Insights released in March, particularly companies that use “deep links” to connect mobile applications the way websites are linked on the web. Search is still a tiny start-up category, especially compared with red-hot services like ride-hailing or grocery delivery. “But as the spate of early-stage investments in mobile search matures, the area could see funding totals increase as well as the entrance of more start-ups,” CB Insights said in its report. Mobile also has several special challenges for an entrenched player like Google. With its constellation of apps and competing operating systems, mobile is a highly fragmented universe, making it harder for one company to index all of the most relevant information the way Google has indexed the web. Also, the answer to many of the most common — and lucrative — queries is neatly structured inside popular applications like Yelp, the local directory service, making it easier to create focused search products that are unlikely to sink Google but could give it “a thousand tiny leaks,” said Jeremy Kressmann, an analyst at eMarketer who covers the search business. Behind the new companies is a conviction that people use mobile phones so differently than they do desktop and laptop computers that the search business is ripe for an overhaul. “Anytime there is a platform change, everything is up for grabs,” said Keith Rabois, a partner at Khosla Ventures, which has backed a mobile search company called Relcy. “No entrepreneur would start, and nobody would fund, a new search product for the web.” The most obvious difference with mobile is that people have their phones with them all the time, giving search companies lots of contextual clues — like location — for what they might want.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLinkedIn, Twitter, Yelp - recent Internet darlings - each slumped by more than 20% this week on weak earnings: A trio of social media stocks is getting pummeled this week, a sign that Wall Street may be unwilling to overlook missteps at some of its Internet darlings. LinkedIn on Thursday plunged as much as 25 percent in after-hours trading after the professional social networking company forecast second-quarter sales that were weaker than Wall Street estimates. The drop followed the declines of two other social networking companies. Twitter shares are down around 25 percent this week after the company reported quarterly sales that fell short of expectations, while local reviews site Yelp plummeted 23 percent on Thursday, a day after it too posted sales that disappointed Wall Street. The performances illustrate the way investors are questioning whether social media companies can keep their growth rates vigorous enough to justify their valuations. The stocks of all three companies had traded at relatively high levels, reflecting Wall Street’s giddy projections. Yet all three shattered that perception in their own way. And while many of these stocks are often volatile, with investors on edge about the weak economy, interest rates and other issues, shareholders increasingly have little tolerance for the slightest misstep. “Based on where some of these stocks were trading, expectations were already very high and were priced for relative perfection,” said Colin Sebastian, a senior analyst for Robert W. Baird & Company. “The reaction when companies don’t achieve great results can be fairly severe.” Any continued rockiness in the stocks could cause repercussions. Last year, several technology companies — including the online storage firm Box — delayed their initial public offerings because of turbulence in tech stocks. A protracted swoon in public tech companies could also trickle into their privately held counterparts. These companies have been frothy lately, with start-ups daily hitting $1 billion-plus valuations and renewing talk of a bubble in Silicon Valley.\\n\\n\\n\\nLinked earnings: Q1 revenue $637M (+35% Y/Y), net loss $42M; shares slump 27% LinkedIn Corp slashed its full-year profit forecast, citing slower revenue growth at its hiring business and a delay in recognizing the contribution of lynda.com, the online education company it has agreed to buy. Shares of LinkedIn fell as much as 27 percent after the bell on Thursday. The professional social network operator agreed this month to buy lynda.com for about $1.5 billion and expects to close the acquisition in the second quarter. LinkedIn forecast 2015 profit of $1.90 per share, excluding items, on revenue of about $2.90 billion. It had earlier forecast earnings of $2.95 per share on revenue of $2.93 billion to $2.95 billion. Revenue growth from the company\\'s hiring business slowed to 36 percent for the first quarter ended March 31. The business, which the company calls Talent Solutions, accounted for about 62 percent of total revenue. Mountain View, California-based LinkedIn reported a net loss attributable to shareholders of $42.5 million, or 34 cents per share, for the first quarter, compared with $13.4 million, or 11 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $637.7 million from $473.2 million.\\n\\n\\nHow mental illnesses help entrepreneurs thrive.\\xa0Michael A. Freeman had long noticed that entrepreneurs seem inclined to have mental health issues. The clinical professor of psychology at UC-San Francisco’s medical school spent a decade at a company where his clients were the founders of businesses. He estimates that about a third of them seemed to have some type of mental health condition. He still notices the trend today in his work coaching executives. Freeman and California-Berkeley psychology professor Sheri Johnson decided to take a deeper look at the issue. They begun polling entrepreneurs and found a strong link between mental health conditions and entrepreneurship. “The people that we admire for being entrepreneurs seem to come from the same gene pool as the people who are kind of socially stigmatized because of mental health conditions,” Freeman said. “They must confer some adaptive advantage otherwise they wouldn’t be so highly represented in the population.” Forty-nine percent of entrepreneurs surveyed reported at least one mental health condition. Nearly a third reported having two or more mental health issues, such as ADHD, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety or substance use conditions. And half of the entrepreneurs who reported no mental-health conditions identified themselves as coming from families with a history of mental illness. This may seem counterintuitive. Why would an unstable person be most attracted and suited to launch a business? Freeman points out that there’s a beneficial side to these mental health conditions. Those weaknesses come with corresponding strengths that the average healthy person doesn’t have. For all of its ills, depression also brings empathy and creativity. Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi attempted suicide as teenagers. Uncommon levels of empathy can allow a businessman to better understand a customer’s need. And a creative mind won’t be satisfied on the corporate ladder, but instead in a fast-moving start-up where he or she can unfurl ideas and dreams. Individuals with ADHD naturally make decisions faster, are comfortable working independently and are more creative, necessary skills at a start-up. They’re likely to be bored working for someone else.\\n\\n\\nRocket Internet-backed Foodpanda raises $100M led by Goldman Sachs: Foodpanda.com, a Rocket Internet-backed global, multi-location online food ordering marketplace (which operates under Hellofood brand in some markets), has raised $100 million funding led by global financial services giant Goldman Sachs, the company said. Existing investors including Rocket Internet also participated in the latest round. This round takes the total funding raised by Foodpanda to date to $310 million. Foodpanda will use the funding to expand its last-mile delivery operations and improve customer experience across 40 markets. The new investment comes barely two months after Rocket Internet led a $110 million funding round in the company. A few unnamed new investors also participated in that round. “We believe that Foodpanda has a tremendous opportunity to cement its emerging markets leadership position in the coming years. It is our expectation that the company’s innovative, value-added offerings will lead Foodpanda to be the winner in online food delivery within the markets in which it operates,” said Ian Friedman, vice president at Goldman Sachs Investment Partners. The company had raised $60 million from a group of investors, including existing investors Falcon Edge Capital and Rocket Internet last August. In February the same year, it had raised $20 million from Phenomen Ventures, a Russia-based venture capital firm, and a group of unnamed investors. Prior to that, Foodpanda had received $8 million in funding from iMena Holdings, an online consumer business group operating in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region in September 2013. Before that, it had raised over $20 million from a group of investors that included Investment AB Kinnevik, a Sweden-based investment company, and Phenomen Ventures. Existing investor Rocket Internet also invested in the round. “The emerging markets represent the largest opportunity in online food delivery and we are committed to create the most convenient way for ordering and delivering food,” said Ralf Wenzel, co-founder and CEO of Foodpanda. Founded in April 2012, Foodpanda features location-specific listing of restaurants on its site. Users can check out menus, along with special offers, post that they can order and get food delivered to their homes. One can also search for restaurants according to cuisine, and/or by other parameters such as vegetarian/non- vegetarian, healthy food, etc. According to the company, it has partnered with over 45,000 restaurants in 40 countries globally. Foodpanda had acquired two key rivals in India over the past few months—Just Eat India and TastyKhana—to cement its position as the top player in the business in the country. It is now facing a bunch of competitors with restaurant review site Zomato starting online food ordering and new VC-backed startups like TinyOwl among others. Recently it started its own food logistics business with last mile delivery from restaurants to the consumers who order online through its site. Earlier, Foodpanda was just an online ordering platform.\\n\\n\\nApple, IBM and Japan Post See Profit in the Old-Age Market: Japan is an incubator of aging. More than other country, it is a graying nation. Twenty-five percent of its population, or 33 million people, are age 65 or older, more than double the global average. IBM, Apple and Japan Post Group, a giant postal service, bank and insurer, declared on Thursday that they were joining to deliver a new technology service to the fast-growing market of older Japanese adults. The service involves equipping Japan’s silver generation with iPads loaded with software apps to help them communicate with family and friends, monitor their health, and buy goods and services. For IBM and Apple, the initiative is another step in the partnership they formed last year, mainly to create mobile apps for corporate workers. The project with Japan Post goes beyond the workplace into homes. Quality-of-life services for aging populations will certainly be a big, if broad and diverse, marketplace. And Japan is a prime test bed. Citing the nation’s geriatric demographics, Taizo Nishimuro, chief executive of Japan Post, said, “Many countries will be facing the same issue soon.”\\n\\n\\nLeaked Lyft Document Reveals a Costly Battle With Uber: Behind the friendly pink mustaches and fist bumps, Lyft is spending furiously to maintain second place in the U.S. ride-sharing industry, and steal market share from the distant leader, Uber Technologies. The expensive battle plan helped Lyft claim a fourfold increase in active passengers on 2.2 million rides in December 2014, but growth is beginning to slow, according to a company presentation to investors that was obtained by Bloomberg. Lyft estimates $130 million in revenue for 2014, according to the document.The presentation offers a revealing look inside a company that\\'s sweeping U.S. cities, and attracting the attention of venture capitalists and regulators. The presentation, compiled for its $530 million fundraising round announced on March 12, includes recent and projected revenue, ridership figures, marketing costs, and other data about the business. Lyft and Uber aren\\'t publicly traded, and neither company discloses financial information about its operations. Lyft and Uber declined to comment In addition to providing a window into its business, Lyft had some choice words for its chief rival. The presentation describes Uber as a \"top-down model,\" with an \"exclusive mentality\" and \"anti-social culture.\" While the 40-page document does not detail Lyft\\'s operating expenses or losses, it does illustrate the mounting costs of marketing the service. Lyft estimates that the company spends a combined $530 on marketing to each driver and 22 passengers in San Francisco, and it takes about nine months to recoup those costs through its Lyft Classic service—not to be confused with the carpooling option, Lyft Line. The company expects to spend 60.5 percent of its revenue on marketing in December 2015, the document says. A ride booked in San Francisco through the Classic service generates a 92-cent profit for Lyft, including marketing costs but excluding corporate expenses, such as software developers and office space. Lyft co-founder John Zimmer told Bloomberg in January that the company is profitable in San Francisco and its other most established markets. The $130 million in revenue for 2014 is based on the combined net revenue from Lyft Classic and gross revenue from Lyft Line during the month of December, which implies $10.8 million in revenue during that month. Using the same calculation, Lyft reports revenue of $12 million in 2013. (Tallying gross revenue from Lyft Line, which includes money paid out to drivers, has the potential to significantly distort the company\\'s 2014 revenue and growth, as well as projections, because the service didn\\'t exist in 2013. However, the document says it does so for the purposes of generally accepted accounting principles.) Lyft projects $796 million for 2015, a slowdown in growth but still an impressive 512 percent jump from 2014. In the interview from January, Zimmer said the company\\'s revenue and rides rose fivefold last year. Despite ride-sharing companies\\' attempts to guard financial details, Uber has faced similar leaks. The company generated $22 million in revenue during a one-week period in November 2013, according to an internal dashboard posted to the blog Valleywag. Uber drivers were completing more than 100,000 trips per week in each of its largest cities, and San Francisco had about 70,000 active users a week in December 2013, according to a separate report in Business Insider. Uber said on Jan. 22 that it has more than 160,000 active drivers in the U.S. who give more than a million rides a day. Lyft has seen similarly staggering growth in the number of drivers and riders using the service. In December 2012, Lyft had 400 drivers giving 40,000 rides a month; by 2013, it had 7,000 drivers and 488,000 rides a month; in 2014, it was 51,000 drivers and 2.2 million monthly rides, according to the document. The number of people booking rides through the app each month rose from 9,000 in 2012 to 631,000 last year. Though currently unprofitable, Lyft\\'s ride economics appear to be going in the right direction. The company increased its share of each fare from 6.7 percent in July 2014 to 25.7 percent in December, the document says. The increase is expected to be less dramatic this year, reaching 26.2 percent in December 2015, according to the company\\'s forecast. The investor presentation also touts its progress with city officials, citing 28 new regulations in six states last year. The document illustrates Lyft\\'s obsession with quick pickups. In San Francisco, the time between a ride request and the car\\'s arrival in December 2014 was 2.62 minutes, an improvement from 3.1 minutes in August. The average time in all of Lyft\\'s markets fell to 3.9 minutes from 4.18 minutes during the same period. It seems the war with Uber could be measured in seconds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPaytm’s big day: IRCTC adds Paytm wallet as a payment option: Government-owned railway ticketing platform IRCTC, which is the one of the most used internet commerce site in the country clocking on an average over half a million tickets a day, has added Paytm’s wallet as an online payment option. IRCTC, the primary seller of railway tickets online (others OTAs act as secondary link) in the country, has been offering various online payments options besides the conventional credit/debit cards and net banking. It allows payments through cash cards, its own co-branded pre-paid Rupay card with Union Bank and with Paytm wallet it adds another payment option. Last we checked the Paytm payment option was integrated on IRCTC’s web portal but was not yet available on its mobile app on Android. The development means a big move for Paytm as it is already available as an alternate payment option in several key internet ventures such as the country’s top online food ordering venture Foodpanda, cab hailing app Uber (in India), eBay and Jabong. Although IRCTC has come a long way in terms of streamlining online payment process on its site, given the huge load on its servers it is not uncommon to see payment failures in a multi-authentication process which comes with a credit and debit cards. Paytm wallet would look to capitalise in partly solving this pain point for users and hopes to also expand its reach in tier-II and tier-III markets, where trains are a primary mode of long distance travel and IRCTC by default is the booking platform.\\n\\n\\nThis too shall pass: Secret Shuts Down: Anonymous sharing app Secret will shut down soon, according to sources close to the company. The announcement could be made as soon as today or tomorrow, and there’s some talk of current employees receiving modest severance packages. Having raised $35 million, it’s unlikely that the company is out of money. But after a major redesign sterilized the app’s identity and made it look just like its much more popular competitor Yik Yak, and its co-founder Chrys Bader-Wechseler left, Secret may see shutting down as the best outcome. Many employees, including top talent like Sarah Haider, Safeer Jiwan, and Amol Jain have left the company over the past month or so. One source says the company has been whittled down to under 10 employees from over 20 several months ago and has been in “maintenance mode.” More here: Secret’s trajectory illustrates the flash-in-the-pan nature of Silicon Valley’s current technology boom. Even as a handful of start-ups rise to stratospheric valuations and take in billions of dollars in financing, other privately held companies cannot sustain their following. Fab.com, a onetime e-commerce darling, was once valued at more than $1 billion and had raised more than $150 million before ending up in a fire sale this year, when it was bought for about $15 million. Other start-ups are dealing with a cooling-off process as big companies muscle in on their turf. Meerkat, a live-streaming video app that gained great traction early this year, is now grappling with the entrance of Twitter and its Periscope live-video app, for example. \\n\\n\\nCloud CRM major Salesforce is exploring a sale - shares up 17%; seen as pricey but valuable target: Cloud software company Salesforce.com Inc  is working with financial advisers to help it field takeover offers after being approached by a potential acquirer, Bloomberg said, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The company\\'s shares rose as much as 17.3 percent to touch an all-time high of $78.46 on Wednesday. They closed up 11.6 percent at $74.65, valuing the company at about $49 billion. Salesforce Seen as Attractive, If Pricey, Target for Cloud Push: Salesforce.com, the software provider that has hired bankers to field takeover offers, would make sense as a partner for a buyer willing to spend a lot to become the leader in cloud computing. Salesforce jumped 12 percent to close at $74.65 in New York on Wednesday, giving the company a market value of about $49 billion. Salesforce’s business is entirely cloud-based. That means that as the company adds clients, it can lower costs-per-customer through economies of scale and by improving operations in its software and data centers. It also can update products and roll out new business lines quickly via the Internet. Also, customers are flocking to software and service contracts that tend to be simpler for cloud computing than for traditional software. Cloud clients also can avoid the sunk costs of buying hardware. “Specific to the cloud, the shift is accelerating and it’s happened more quickly than the big guys were hoping,” Steven R. Koenig, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc., said in an interview. The San Francisco-based company would give an acquirer “a lot of critical mass in the cloud.” Salesforce had 16 percent of the customer-relationship management market in 2013, compared with 13 percent for SAP SE, 10 percent for Oracle Corp. and 7 percent for Microsoft Corp., according to Gartner Inc. Salesforce will have more than 15 million end users in 2018, up from around 6 million last year, Gartner wrote in a November report. The CRM market has “gone to Salesforce, and no one is going to catch up,” Koenig said. Around 40 percent of organizations with greater than a billion dollars in annual revenue ran all their CRM applications within their own data centers last year, according to Gartner. That will shrink to 25 percent by 2020 as companies move to the cloud, Gartner said. As customers start to move into cloud CRM systems offered by Salesforce, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP, they also to tend to buy related products, such as analytics or marketing services, from the same company. That stitches clients tightly to their provider, making it less likely for them to move away. “There is still room for Salesforce.com and competitors to grow rapidly in CRM without reaching capacity for at least the next five years,” Gartner wrote. Salesforce has begun investing in data centers around the world. Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff has said the company would open “multiple” data centers in Germany, along with ones in France and Canada. Local facilities help the company serve customers with stringent data regulations, without having to give up the economies of scale and operational expertize gained by being a cloud company. Salesforce also has expanded into data analytics through investments and product development. Lashing these various products together with its Salesforce1 program has allowed the company to pursue larger contracts with bigger firms. Salesforce closed 550 deals valued more than a million dollars each in its most recent fiscal year, up around 100 from the prior year, the company said in February.\\n\\n\\nYelp Shares Tumble on as First-Quarter Earnings, Outlook Disappoint: Yelp Inc., an operator of user-review websites, declined as much as 17 percent in extended trading after its profit and sales forecast missed analysts’ estimates. The San Francisco-based company reported a first-quarter loss of $1.28 million, or 2 cents a share, from $2.64 million, or 4 cents, a year earlier. Analysts’ estimated a profit of 1 cent. Revenue was $118.5 million, the company said Wednesday in a statement, trailing estimates of $119.8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yelp forecast second-quarter sales of $131 million to $134 million, falling short of analysts’ average estimate of $137.4 million. “There’s not a lot of forgiveness for technology companies right now,” said Blake Harper, an analyst at Wunderlich Securities Inc.. “They are valued pretty well and there’s an expectation that they’ll perform well.” Yelp operates websites that let users search local businesses for free and read reviews about them. The company charges for advertising on those sites. It had 142 million unique monthly visitors in the period, an increase of 7.6 percent from a year earlier. Yelp’s local advertising revenue dropped as a result of a sales-force restructuring implemented in the first quarter, Harper said. Shares of Yelp dropped to a low of $42.68 in extended trading after closing at $51.28. The company competes with Angie’s List Inc. as well as new features offered by companies including Amazon.com Inc.\\n\\n\\nBaidu Sees Revenue Growth And Profit Slump In Q1 2015: China\\'s dominant Internet search engine Baidu Inc on Thursday posted its slowest revenue growth rate in almost seven years in the first quarter of 2015, as customers spent less money on its core online marketing business. The company\\'s bid to create new avenues of income from mobile in China, the world\\'s biggest smartphone market, also took their toll. Baidu\\'s profit margins sank to their lowest in a decade, or 19 percent, as promotional costs for new businesses and research and development expenses skyrocketed. The search company\\'s bid to promote new mobile-centric businesses like food delivery to compete with Tencent and Alibaba saw selling, general and administrative expenses rocket 47.2 percent to $477 million from a year ago. Revenues of 12.73 billion yuan ($2.05 billion) came in below forecasts of 12.9 billion yuan, according to a Thomson Reuters SmartEstimate poll of 16 analysts. Coupled with a 3.4 percent decline in net profit from the previous year, this prompted shares to slide 2.6 percent in trading after market close in New York. Baidu said it expected second-quarter revenue to be between 16.37 billion yuan and 16.75 billion yuan. A hiring spree for research and development also pushed the department\\'s expenses up 79.1 percent to $368.8 million. Baidu\\'s net income, its lowest in two years, was 2.4 billion yuan for the first three months of 2015. Profit margins of 19 percent were the lowest in almost a decade.\\n\\n\\nFlipkart acquires Delhi-based analytics and visual A/B testing platform Appiterate: India’s largest e-commerce platform Flipkart has acquired Delhi- and San Francisco-based DSYN Technologies Pvt Ltd, which provides a native mobile analytics and A/B testing platform for app developers and enterprises under the brand name Appiterate. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed. The acquisition is in line with Flipkart’s ‘mobile first’ focus, the firm said on Wednesday. Post the acquisition, Appiterate’s mobile marketing automation platform will be integrated with Flipkart’s mobile app which will help the e-commerce firm in targeting users based on their activity on the app and website. Appiterate is a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) A/B testing platform for native mobile apps. It allows app publishers to A/B test and iteratively optimise the designs (UX) and functionality of their mobile apps to improve in-app purchases, user engagement and conversion metrics. It also allows app publishers to run tests based on user segments and see real-time conversion metrics. The company says it has been delivering more than 100 million personalised notifications each month through its platform for leading e-commerce companies. Last year, it raised Rs 3 crore in seed funding from SAIF Partners, with participation from a group of individuals, including Greg Badros, former VP (product & engineering) at Facebook and Prashant Malik, former tech lead at Facebook and co-creator of Apache Cassandra.\\n\\n\\nTwitter Troubles Lie in Marketers’ Reluctance to Buy New Kind of Ad: As a company, Twitter is an adolescent — gangly, starry-eyed, growing like a weed and unpredictable. No wonder advertisers and investors are having trouble figuring it out. The social networking company shocked Wall Street on Tuesday by reporting slower-than-expected growth in advertising sales, which account for nearly all of its revenue. Shares of Twitter, which fell 18 percent on Tuesday after the first-quarter results were disclosed, dropped an additional 9 percent on Wednesday. Although revenue rose a brisk 74 percent in the quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago, it was less growth than in Twitter’s five previous quarters and well below the high bar that the company had set. Twitter attributed the disappointment to advertisers’ reluctance to spend heavily on ads that prompt the viewer to take an action, like download a smartphone app or apply for a credit card. This type of ad, known as direct response, is a newer area for Twitter, which originally focused on general brand image ads. Marketers say they are indeed more cautious about Twitter’s direct-response ads because the microblogging service has not yet shown that it can target or track those ads with the level of precision that advertisers want. Compared with mature rivals like Google and Facebook, Twitter doesn’t know as much about its users, and it is more difficult to measure results. Facebook has so much data on its users, “you could actually target a premium credit card to a businessman you know is traveling all the time,” said Bryan Wiener, chairman of 360i, a digital marketing agency that works with brands like Capital One, NBCUniversal, Spotify, Oreo and Oscar Mayer. “That’s the kind of information that’s missing from Twitter,” he said. “There’s not this rich history of your holistic life.” As a result, he said, many brands are unwilling to commit big money to Twitter ad campaigns. Mr. Freeman said that, in general, Twitter is best for building brand awareness and recall. Its weakness is the ability to measure direct-response effectiveness. “A lot of times, brands don’t really know what to do with it,” he said. “And that was Twitter’s fault because I don’t think they had a very clear direction.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter Q1 earnings: $436M, +74% Y/Y, net loss $162M; shares crash 18% on weakness in both engagement and monetization:\\xa0Twitter posted weaker-than-expected financial results for the first quarter on Tuesday and told investors to reduce their expectations for the rest of the year. The quarterly report, which was supposed to be published after the stock market closed, was obtained early and posted on Twitter by the financial analytics firm Selerity. The release sent Twitter shares plunging. Trading was briefly halted so the company could disseminate its results. That steepened the drop, and the stock ended the day down about 18 percent. Twitter’s revenue grew 74 percent in the quarter, but that was less than the 97 percent growth seen in the fourth quarter and below the company’s own forecasts. Executives attributed the slowdown to a transition to a new advertising model that priced certain ads based on the result, such as whether the viewer downloaded an app, instead of whether the person simply clicked on it. Analysts said, however, that the shortfall suggested that the real-time network might be less useful than competitors for what are called direct-response ads. “Do people want to leave what they are doing on Twitter and do something else like buy something?” said Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst at the research firm eMarketer. “Direct-response advertisers haven’t figured out the best way to use Twitter, and Twitter hasn’t figured out the best way to market to them.” The quarterly results may renew calls for the resignation of Twitter’s chief executive, Dick Costolo, who has been under fire from some investors ever since the company’s initial public offering in the fall of 2013. “User growth doesn’t appear to be notably improving, and now monetization is failing to live up to expectations,” said Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research. “That’s why the stock is selling off so hard. The question is, How much of this is Twitter’s own missteps versus how much of this is peers such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat eating into their advertising?” Twitter said that 302 million people used its service at least once a month during the first quarter. That is up from 288 million in December and in line with recent trends. But the figure failed to impress investors, who have been eager to see results from recent changes Twitter has made to help newcomers better understand how to use its service. Twitter’s revenue, most of which derives from advertising, came in at $436 million in the first quarter, up from $250 million in the same quarter a year ago. That was well below the $457 million that Wall Street analysts had expected, according to estimates collected by S&P Capital IQ. The company also continued to lose money in the first quarter: $162 million, or 25 cents a share. Excluding stock-based compensation and certain other expenses, however, the company reported a profit of $46.5 million, or 7 cents a share. On that basis, Wall Street had expected Twitter to earn 4 cents a share.\\n\\n\\nTwitter CEO faces a crisis of confidence: Twitter Inc.’s chief executive officer failed to foresee a slowdown that forced the social-media company to miss analysts’ first-quarter revenue estimates and cut its 2015 sales forecast, and the stock slumped 18 percent. While this isn’t the first time Twitter has fallen short on promised results, investors had been told that new features and services, as well as a management overhaul, were starting to pay off. Now, with results missing projections and executives warning of a “slow start” to April user additions, analysts are asking whether Twitter’s potential market is limited and about management’s ability to lure more users and advertisers“Management will again have to address credibility concerns,” Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note to investors. The quarter’s performance “raises the question of how much visibility into advertiser and consumer demand for its offerings Twitter really has,” he said. As Twitter has evolved, Costolo has also sought to explain changes in how the company’s performance should be measured. He usually has a positive business reason for why a number went down. For example, after a slump in timeline views, a metric that Twitter touted as a key figure before its November 2013 initial public offering, Costolo said product improvements had made clicks less necessary, deflating the importance of a number that was supposed to measure user interest. That figure no longer appears on earnings releases, and Twitter hasn’t replaced it with a new metric to track engagement. As Twitter’s monthly active user growth slowed, Costolo responded by saying that it didn’t show the whole picture because 500 million people also visit Twitter’s website each month without logging in. Now, Twitter has decided to tweak the metric, it said on the conference call, making historical comparisons more difficult. The company is adding to the total user count people who access Twitter and send tweets via SMS, or text messaging, in emerging markets, reasoning that they will one day become regular users when upgrading their phones. The change, which will start this quarter, would have added 6 million more people to the prior period’s total count.\\n\\n\\nOracle raises $10B in debt as tech majors borrow to sweeten equity with dividends, buybacks: Oracle sold $10 billion of notes on Tuesday, including the software maker’s first bond that will mature in 40 years, at yields that were lower than originally offered, according to a person with knowledge of the deal. Amgen, the world’s second-biggest biotech company, issued $1.25 billion in 30-year securities at its lowest coupon for that maturity as a part of a $3.5 billion debt sale, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Both borrowers raised debt to return capital to their equity investors. The highest-rated companies that have been building up their balance sheets after the financial crisis are showing willingness to borrow to satisfy stock investors pushing them to lift share prices. And even as the Federal Reserve moves closer to raising interest rates, forecasts that the U.S. central bank will wait until September, is encouraging borrowers to embrace yields on corporate bonds that are hovering near record lows. Apple Inc. said Monday it may tap debt markets to fund share buybacks. Investors are rewarding companies that have hoarded cash and tightened spending. The ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index is near the lowest levels on record. Oracle last month boosted its dividend for the first time since 2013 by 25 percent to 15 cents a share, up from the prior payout of 12 cents. Oracle, based in Redwood City, California, last sold bonds in June, when it issued $10 billion. The company sold the new debt in six parts, with the $1.25 billion 40-year portion yielding 170 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, 10 basis points less than where the deal was initially marketed. Apple unveiled a plan Monday to boost its share-buyback authorization by $50 billion to $140 billion, and increasing the company’s dividend by 11 percent. Cupertino, California-based Apple has issued the equivalent of $40.35 billion of bonds since April 2013, when it sold $17 billion in what at the time was the biggest corporate-bond offering ever.\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft might be approaching a substantial goodwill impairment from the Nokia purchase: Microsoft made waves recently by disclosing in its quarterly 10-Q document that its Phone business, which generates billions in yearly revenue, isn’t performing as well as it expected. As Microsoft is carrying billions of dollars of goodwill related to the Nokia purchase on its books, the warning landed like a brick in a puddle of lukewarm slop. History as prelude in this case is the aQuantive boondoggle, during which Microsoft wrote of billions of dollars of value relating to that purchase. As Business Insider’s Matt Weinberger recently wrote: “[T]he last time Microsoft used language like this in an earnings report was back in 2012, three months before it took a $6.2 billion charge to its bottom line for its aQuantive acquisition.” Microsoft currently counts quite a lot of goodwill as an intangible asset on its books. In its most recent quarters, the dollar amount of goodwill sourced from the Nokia deal, in which Microsoft bought the majority of the Finnish company’s hardware assets, sat around the $5.4 billion mark. That’s about a quarter of the company’s total goodwill, which it reports as just over $21.7 billion. Microsoft may not be forced to write down any goodwill relating to the Nokia deal. Or it may have to write down quite a lot. In terms of scale, how bad could the damage be? A massive write down could tank a quarter of the company’s profit, using normal accounting methods (GAAP). Using adjusted metrics, Microsoft could take the non-cash charge in stride, more shamefaced than materially castigated. On a GAAP basis, things get more interesting. The $5.4 billion in goodwill that the company currently counts as an asset is more than the company’s last-quarter GAAP profit. So, in theory, a massive write down could erase a full quarter’s profits both per-share and in aggregate. We can look back to the aQuantive write down to see the potential impact. Here’s Microsoft, from the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2012. In short, the write down essentially erased the company’s profit for the quarter.\\n\\n\\nIn sharp reversal, US retailer Best Buy will start accepting Apple Pay in all stores: Best Buy announced on Monday that it now accepts Apple Pay payments for purchases made inside its smartphone app, and by the end of the year will accept payments made in its brick-and-mortar stores using the Apple Pay mobile wallet. A Best Buy spokesman said in a statement that the electronics retailer wanted to give customers as many options as possible in how they pay for goods and services. The company also plans to open a technology innovation office in the Seattle area to work on mobile technology issues, the spokesman said. That is a sharp reversal from just a few months ago, when major retailers like Rite-Aid and CVS abruptly shut off the ability to accept Apple Pay payments in their retail stores. Best Buy has not accepted Apple Pay payments in the past. The issue was not whether these companies want a mobile wallet to catch on. More than 50 retailers, including Walmart, Best Buy and Gap, started working together years ago to develop CurrentC, a smartphone-based payments product still in development. The hope was that for members of the consortium, also called the Merchant Customer Exchange or MCX, accepting mobile payments through their CurrentC app could be a way to help retailers understand more about their customers’ shopping habits and, potentially, let merchants avoid the high fees they pay when processing credit card transactions. However, when Apple Pay made its debut, MCX retail partners were contractually bound not to accept alternative mobile wallet payments, according to two retailers involved in MCX, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details of the partnership are private. That meant that even though the CurrentC product is still unreleased, partner retailers would not be able to take Apple Pay or Google Wallet transactions. Some of those exclusivity agreements will expire soon, people close to the coalition said, which could explain why Best Buy will accept Apple Pay in stores this year.\\n\\n\\nPremjiInvest may lead $50M fresh investment in grocery e-tailer BigBasket. PremjiInvest, the private investment arm of Wipro Ltd chairman Azim Premji, is in discussions to lead a $50 million (Rs 312 crore) Series C investment round in Bangalore-based SuperMarket Grocery Supplies, which owns and operates online groceries marketplace – BigBasket.com, sources told Techcircle.in. According to senior investment bankers who are aware of the discussions, this fresh round of funding is expected to be wrapped within three months. Request for views on the development from the management of BigBasket and PremjiInvest did not elicit any response. This comes within seven months of BigBasket raising Rs 200 crore ($32.9 million) in its Series B round of funding from a clutch of investors including Helion Venture Partners and Mumbai-based Zodius Capital. After establishing its presence in its home market Bangalore, it has expanded into Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad and Chennai. It is expected to enter Delhi soon. The firm still has cash from the last round but would need a larger stash not just to enter new markets but to create a war-chest to fight fresh competitors, including some which follow an asset-light hyper-local grocery delivery marketplace. In the grocery e-commerce space ZopNow raised $10 million from Dragoneer Investment Group with participation from the existing investors Accel Partners, Qualcomm Ventures and Times Internet. ZopNow, which earlier competed head on with BigBasket, has pivoted to become an asset-light business and partners with offline hypermarket chain HyperCity to pick products and deliver to consumers who order online. Then there are a bunch of delivery startups which essentially connects users to local grocers. Grofers raised $45 million across two rounds since January this year; PepperTap raised $10 million while LocalBanya also got fresh funding. BigBasket is understood to have closed FY15 with a top-line of Rs 250 crore, with a run-rate of 6,000 orders a day with average billing of Rs 1,500 per customer. It had generated sales of around Rs 70 crore in the year ended March 31, 2014, according to VCCEdge, the data research platform of VCCircle.\\n\\n\\nIndonesian startup Cubeacon aims to be pioneer in iBeacon technology: Cubeacon wants to be Indonesia’s pioneer in iBeacon technology: It’s a rare thing to hear about software-as-a-service (SaaS) ventures from Indonesia, and even more rare to hear about hardware innovation. But Cubeacon combines both. It focuses on customer loyalty management with a hardware component based on Apple’s iBeacon technology. The startup may be so far ahead of the curve in Indonesia that its CEO Tiyo Avianto is focusing Cubeacon’s distribution in the Japanese market for the time being. Cubeacon uses a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) sensor that was introduced by Apple under the name of iBeacon in 2013. iBeacon sensors are made to be placed indoors, for instance inside a shop. These sensors can detect a customer’s position within the shop very precisely, and they can send offers or information relevant to that location directly to a customer’s phone (so long as they have Bluetooth turned on). Potentially, hundreds of sensor units can be installed across one location. Along with its sensor units, which Cubeacon calls a Cubeacon Box, the company delivers customizable software which shop owners can configure depending on their context and requirements, for example to receive analytics and maps, and to deliver custom ads, or push notifications. “At this time we can produce about 2,500 Cubeacon units per month,” Avianto says. Cubeacon hopes to tap into the big budgets that major companies have at hand for their customer loyalty programs. “Cubeacon exists to bring a different experience to customer loyalty,” he says. Cubeacon’s revenue is based on hardware unit sales, but it also charges for its software on a subscription-based model. For large companies, Cubeacon’s software can be white labelled, meaning that it can be branded and adapted to suit the firm’s needs. It even allows the integration of other iBeacon-based devices, which makes the software attractive for developer companies who are already experts in the technology.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple earnings: revenue $58B (+27% Y/Y), net income $13.6B (+33%). Another monster quarter sends shares modestly up (1.3%):\\xa0 In total, revenue climbed 27 percent to $58 billion, up from $45.6 billion last year, the company said in its earnings report. Profit was $13.6 billion, up from $10.2 billion a year ago.  Mr. Dawson said. Over all, Apple sold 61.2 million iPhones in the quarter, beating analysts’ estimates of roughly 60 million phones. That also far exceeded the 43.7 million iPhones that Apple sold in the period a year ago. Analysts had anticipated that iPhone sales would increase sharply, largely because of the company’s growing presence in greater China. Apple also said it was seeing a higher rate of people switching to iPhones from Android smartphones. Sales of Apple’s iPad declined for the fifth quarter in a row, however. The company sold 12.6 million iPads, compared with 16.4 million tablets a year ago. Over the last year, Apple’s tablet sales have steadily shrunk, partly because people do not upgrade those devices as frequently as they do smartphones. In addition, as smartphone screen sizes increase, some consumers question whether they need both a tablet and a phone. Apple also sold 4.6 million Mac computers in the quarter, up from 4.1 million a year ago. Apple on Monday also said it increased its capital return program by 50 percent, to $200 billion in cash by the end of March 2017. Apple is increasing its share repurchases to $140 billion from $90 billion, and is also raising its dividend to shareholders. The company’s cash and securities pile stood at $193.5 billion as of the end of the quarter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple\\'s revenue from China this quarter: $16.8B (+71% Y/Y) - sells more iPhones in China than in the US Apple’s growth engine has now shifted unmistakably to China. The company said on Monday that quarterly iPhone sales in greater China, which includes mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, had surpassed those in Apple’s home market, the United States, for the first time. While Apple did not disclose specific numbers, the performance powered the company’s revenue, with sales in greater China rising 71 percent to $16.8 billion in the fiscal second quarter compared with the same period last year. Revenue from greater China also exceeded that from Europe for the first time. The China results punctuated another strong quarter for Apple. Apple has long laid the groundwork to reap big sales in China, and revenue growth from the region has steadily gained momentum. The company in late 2013 struck an important deal to sell iPhones through China Mobile, the world’s largest phone carrier. Apple is also expanding its operations in the region, with 21 retail stores and plans to increase that number to 40 by mid-2016. Add to all that the fact that the Chinese New Year holiday, typically a big retail season, was in February. The latest iPhones also have much bigger screens than past models, another feature that has been especially popular in China. Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst for Jackdaw Research, said Apple’s performance in China highlighted its advantages against other American technology companies. “It’s hugely important because it shows that Apple continues to be the only major U.S. tech company that is really succeeding in China, in contrast to Google, Microsoft and Amazon,”\\n\\n\\nApple is raising prices, and still managing to sell more units. Apple is pulling off a feat almost unheard of in the history of consumer electronics – as more competitors offer rival products for less, Apple is raising prices and still selling more gadgets. The latest report from the International Data Corporation estimates that Apple held nearly 20 percent of the world’s smartphone market at the end of 2014, an increase from 17.5 percent the previous year. It largely took those sales away from Android-based smartphones, which declined by about the same amount over that period\\n\\n\\nAmazon starts Sunday delivery service in India: Global e-commerce giant Amazon has expanded the scope of its logistics services and is now delivering products on Sundays starting with 100 cities of the country, it said. It’s key competitor Flipkart among others already deliver products on Sundays so Amazon’s move is more a catch-up rather than an industry-first initiative. Amazon has already been doing same day, next day, two day and release (or launch) day delivery options for products. However, if consumers ordered the product on a Friday (two-day delivery option) or Saturday (one day delivery option) their deliveries was still rolled over to Monday as the firm was not delivering on Sundays. This changes now. Currently, Amazon has over 700,000 products available for next day delivery across eligible pin codes in several cities and around 75 per cent customer demand is already eligible for next-day shipping on products fulfilled by Amazon.\\n\\n\\nFacebook Adds Free Video Calls to Messenger App: Facebook is adding free video calls to its Messenger communications app, showing how quickly it is raising its game in a battle with other global tech behemoths to dominate every form of mobile communications. Just last month, the company introduced a feature that lets Messenger users to send money to each other. A few days later, it opened up Messenger to outside developers, and now users can download dozens of apps to send funny GIFs, personalized emoji and other enhanced messages. Video calling fills a major hole in the Messenger service, which has about 600 million users worldwide and has evolved from instant messages sent within the Facebook social network into a standalone app. Competitors such as Google’s Hangouts, Microsoft’s Skype, Apple’s Facetime, and Tencent’s WeChat have all offered video calling for some time. The company said in a blog post Monday that it has begun rolling out the Messenger upgrade to Android and iOS users in about 18 countries, including the United States, Mexico and much of Europe, and it should be available across the globe within the next few weeks. Facebook hopes to replicate the success it had with free voice calling in Messenger, which was first offered in 2013 but really took off a year ago after a major update to the software made it easier to use. Since then, Messenger calls have grown to about 10 percent of all mobile voice calls globally, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, told investors on Wednesday when reporting the company’s first-quarter financial results. The video calling feature is a way to spontaneously upgrade from a text conversation when the participants think video is necessary, said Stan Chudnovsky, Facebook’s head of product for messaging, in an interview. That contrasts with the typical use of other video messaging services such as Skype or Hangouts, which are more oriented towards planned video calls. “We just think we are serving different use cases,” he said. The calls are encrypted and Facebook cannot eavesdrop on them, Mr. Chudnovsky said. Facebook designed the video feature to adapt to the connection on each side, so calls in places with weak cellular data networks will be at lower resolution than those on a fast Wi-Fi network. \\n\\n\\nSources: Amazon Plans ‘Prime For Business,’ Folding AmazonSupply Into Big B2B Play: TechCrunch has been told by sources that Amazon is now doubling down on its B2B supply marketplace. The focus will be on Amazon for Business, complete with extra features that will be offered only to registered business customers. Think of it as “Prime for Business.” According to sources briefed on the matter, as a consequence of this, Amazon plans to shutter AmazonSupply, its existing B2B portal for hardware, lab & scientific, health & safety, sanitation and office supplies that Amazon dubs “The store for business and industry.” One source says the closure of AmazonSupply will happen by the end of this year, with the products that it offers there instead folded into Amazon.com and the bigger Amazon for Business offering, not unlike Amazon’s closure of Endless in the shoe and fashion category and folding that into its fashion category in 2012. Aside from our own sources, it seems others have also been hearing similar murmurs of AmazonSupply getting folded into Amazon.com. And in other markets, like India, Amazon is launching B2B supply services doing away with the AmazonSupply brand altogether, opting instead for Amazon for Business. Whether it’s called AmazonSupply or Amazon for Business, it’s a big opportunity for the company. A Forbes article profiling AmazonSupply and the opportunity of B2B wholesale sales noted that in the U.S. alone there was $7.3 trillion worth of goods sold to businesses according to the last U.S. Census, compared to $4 trillion for retail sales (the area we know Amazon for best these days). “Our goal is to supply everything needed to rebuild civilization,” Amazon notes rather ambitiously on its job openings page for the B2B effort. The “Prime”-style tier that our sources tell us is being planned — we don’t know what actual name it will have or whether it will just be called “Amazon for Business” — for registered users will have various perks. They will include special pricing for items; bulk discounts; medical and lab registration; and items available only to business customers (for example, chemicals and medical devices available only for registered hospitals and labs). As with the Prime badge for retail consumers, items with special B2B features will be highlighted in a special color.\\n\\n\\nUS data center consolidation continues: Telx Group Inc, a private equity-owned provider of data centers and network solutions to companies, is exploring a sale that could value it at around $2 billion, including debt, according to people familiar with the matter. U.S. businesses\\' burgeoning demand for data and video is fueling a revival in fiber optic services and data centers. New York-based Telx manages 1.3 million square feet of data center space and more than 50,000 network connections. The company owns 20 data centers, including three major ones in New York City. Its customers range from small businesses that only need half of a cabinet in data centers to global companies requiring a full-floor lease. Telx is just the latest data center company to hit the auction block. Zayo Group Holdings ZAYO.O bought data center company Latysis in February for $675 million, while AT&T has been pursuing a sale of its data centers worth $2 billion. Earlier on Monday, Lightower Fiber Networks, a fiber company that is also owned by Berkshire Partners and ABRY partners, bought Fibertech Networks from Court Square Networks for $1.9 billion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba-backed Paytm pushes deeper into e-commerce, adds mobile marketplace app for e-merchants:\\xa0Paytm, an Indian online payments platform backed by China’s Alibaba, is pushing deeper into India’s booming e-commerce industry with a zero-commission mobile app marketplace targeted at small and medium-sized firms, the mainstay of the country’s economy. The company said on Friday this push, in addition to its existing general e-commerce platform, would help marketplace operations make up half of its total revenue target of $4 billion by the end of 2015. “This is our move into mobile commerce,” said Paytm Chief Executive Vijay Shekhar Sharma, adding the mobile app was designed to connect small businesses and consumers. Even though only about a quarter of the population can access the Internet, India already has the world’s third-largest population of internet users, thanks to cheap smartphones. That has driven a boom in e-commerce, in a country that had previously shopped largely in informal stalls and bazaars. Paytm, which has yet to turn a profit, will not charge merchants commission on their sales, making money instead on commissions levied when they transfer money earned out of the site. Paytm expects to have 100,000 merchants on its app by the end of the year, up from about 33,000 today on their general web platform. It expects to grow the number of stock-keeping units — essentially, units sold — from 8.5 million today to 100 million by the end of the year.\\n\\n\\nRatan Tata buys a stake in Xiaomi, will also act as advisor (more here) Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of the holding company of India\\'s Tata conglomerate, has acquired a stake in Xiaomi Technology [XTC.UL], a deal that is likely to bolster the Chinese phone maker\\'s presence in the world\\'s third-largest smartphone market. Financial details of the unspecified stake bought by Tata in Xiaomi, the first by an Indian, were not disclosed in the statement issued by the Chinese company on Sunday. Xiaomi, the No. 3 global smartphone maker, was valued at $45 billion after a December funding round. Tata, a respected business leader who was the chairman of salt-to-software Tata Sons for more than two decades, has previously invested in Indian start-ups, including online retailer Snapdeal. Tata\\'a investment in Xiaomi comes against the backdrop of an aggressive push by Xiaomi in India after entering the market, which has huge growth potential with just one in 10 people using smartphones, in July 2014. On Thursday, Xiaomi hosted its first global launch outside of China in the Indian capital New Delhi, unveiling its feature-heavy Mi 4i model that supports six Indian languages at 12,999 rupees ($205). Xiaomi and other Chinese smartphone makers are drafting in cricket teams and Bollywood stars to conquer India, their largest overseas market and a key testing ground for their international expansion. \"Mr. Tata is one of the most well-respected business leaders in the world. An investment by him is an affirmation of the strategy we have undertaken in India so far,\" Lei Jun, founder and chief executive officer of Xiaomi said in the statement. \"We are looking forward to bringing more products into India,\" he said.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba, China Telecom tie up to sell cheap smartphones in China\\'s smaller cities: Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and state-owned China Telecom Corp Ltd have tied up to sell inexpensive smartphones aimed at boosting mobile commerce in smaller cities and rural areas. The phones, dubbed \"Tianyi Taobao Shopping Handsets\", will come installed with either an app for easy access to Alibaba\\'s flagship Taobao online shopping platform or its home-grown YunOS mobile operating system, it said in a statement late on Friday. Buyers will be eligible for four months of free 2G data service. The partnership is a bid to deepen Alibaba\\'s e-commerce base in less developed parts of the country and promote its mobile operating system in a shrinking, cut-throat handset market. Six models produced by Coolpad, Hisense and TCL would come with the Mobile Taobao app pre-installed. Mobile Taobao is China\\'s most popular mobile shopping app with more than 200 million monthly active users, it said. Another eight models, made by lesser-known brands including Uniscope, Ctyon and Kingsun, will run YunOS, providing buyers with an Alibaba account for shopping and cloud-based storage, and other preloaded services, it said.\\n\\n\\nGE is installing sensors into L.E.D streetlights so that city can collect data: Earlier this month, General Electric announced it was selling GE Capital, its financial arm. With less fanfare, G.E. also unveiled plans for computer-connected L.E.D. streetlights, so cities can collect and analyze performance data, for lower costs and better safety. GE Capital was a huge profit center after the financial deregulation of the 1980s, but that was then. Sensor-rich lights, to be found eventually in offices and homes, are for a company that will sell knowledge of behavior as much as physical objects. “The next generation of bulbs have a life cycle of 20 years; we can’t think of that as a transactional business anymore,” said Bill Ruh, the head of G.E.’s software center. “We can put cameras and more sensors on these, and measure motion, heat, air quality.” Retailers might want such lights to steer shoppers, he said, while consumers could better learn about their electricity consumption. This sensor explosion is only starting: Huawei, a Chinese maker of computing and communications equipment with $47 billion in revenue, estimates that by 2025 over 100 billion things, including smartphones, vehicles, appliances and industrial equipment, will be connected to cloud computing systems. The Internet will be almost fused with the physical world. \\n\\n\\nAmerica\\'s car market is being disrupted by online retailers: To say that Beepi is disruptive, in this age of disruptions, sounds clichéd. Yet after just a year of operation in California, Beepi is now buying and selling hundreds of cars a month and is on track to book revenue of $100 million over the next year, the company said. The start-up has raised nearly $80 million in financing and it plans to expand to seven additional regions nationwide by the end of the year. Beepi’s rapid growth illustrates something deeper about the role the digital world keeps playing in our lives: There’s no limit to it. A few years ago, it seemed reasonable to assume there were some sectors of the economy that would resist the pull of the Internet and which most people felt were better left offline. Shopping for groceries or eyeglasses, say; now both those tasks are moving online. Beepi and similar competitors, including Carlypso and Carvana, are pushing people to cross another threshold on the way toward a digital-only life. Although auto experts doubt that online-only car-buying experiences will become the norm, it would be wise not to discount their rise, for the simple reason that the Internet remains hungry. As people grow more accustomed to doing pretty much everything over computers and phones, the Internet tends to consume everything in its path. When Mr. Resnik began investigating the auto sales industry, he found that more than 90 percent of American car buyers consulted the Internet for purchases and a rising number of people worldwide say they would buy a car entirely online. According to a study by the research firm Capgemini, about a third of Americans and two-thirds of Chinese who were asked said they would buy a car over the web. To Mr. Resnik, the latent consumer interest was a starting point, and along with a friend, Owen Savir, he set out to create a system to bring to car shopping all the conveniences we’ve grown used to with other online purchases. “We just thought that the car market was broken,” Mr. Resnik said. At the core of Beepi’s business model is a pricing trick. There are three relevant prices for any used car. The trade-in price, which is what a dealer will give you for your car; the private sales price, which is what you can get if you sold it directly to someone else; and the retail price, which is the price the car will command at a dealership. Dealers pay the trade-in price for vehicles and then sell them at the retail price. On some cars, that spread can be worth 50 percent. Beepi thinks it can make a profit while operating within a tighter pricing band. When you list your car with the site, the company’s pricing algorithm, which consults data on historical car sales in your area, offers a price at least $1,000 more than you can get by trading in your car at the dealer. That is still less than what you would get selling privately, but Beepi’s price is guaranteed. If your car doesn’t sell within 30 days of listing on Beepi, the company will buy it from you. On the other side of the transaction, Beepi sells cars at prices lower than comparable certified used cars at dealerships. It can do so, the founder says, because its overhead is lower — it doesn’t have to maintain parking lots to house cars, because the vehicles stay with the sellers until they are sold. Also, because it buys and sells cars over a wide area — currently, any city in California and Arizona — it can take advantage of supply and demand disparities in different regions. Finally, Beepi caps its own fee at 9 percent, depending on price and demand (it will take as little as 1 percent). “When you put it together, we think you can give more to sellers, more to buyers, and make up to 9 percent of the price,” Mr. Resnik said. But if Beepi is faster, more convenient, and a better financial deal than the traditional car market, it also suffers one huge downside. Beepi does not let buyers test-drive cars before buying. Instead, it takes a page from other online retailers’ return policies. Like a pair of shoes from Zappos, Beepi’s cars come with a 10-day, try-it-out money-back guarantee. If you aren’t satisfied, the company will send a truck to take the car away free. The company positions this as better than a dealer’s test-drive. “It’s a 10-day test drive,” Mr. Savir said. But that could be a tough sell. Mr. Resnik of Beepi said  only a handful of people have returned their cars, at a rate “much, much lower than 1 percent.” And he isn’t worried that there won’t be consumer demand in buying cars without a test-drive. “As people buy more and more online, they’re getting used to it,” he said. “It’s going to happen.”\\n\\n\\n\"Apple Won’t Always Rule. Just Look at IBM\" In a few short years, Apple has become the biggest company on the planet by market value — so big that it dwarfs every other one on the stock market. It dominates the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index as no other company has in 30 years. Apple’s market capitalization — the value of all of the shares of its stock — is more than $758 billion, greater than any other company’s. Yet the Wall Street consensus is that Apple is still having a growth spurt. In fact, if Apple’s watches, phones, laptops and other gadgets and services keep generating favorable publicity — and if its quarterly earnings report on Monday is as strong as the market expects it to be — there’s a reasonable chance that Apple’s value will keep swelling. Not far down the road, it might even reach the $1 trillion level that some hedge funds predict. But even if Apple still has some room to run, there are some early warning signs. After all, the company has already crossed a significant threshold. In February, it grew to twice the size of the next biggest company in the S.&P. 500, a rare feat of financial dominance, and one that hasn’t happened since Ronald Reagan was president. I checked the numbers with Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. He found that the last market colossus to tower over its competitors by a two-to-one ratio was IBM, which did it in three successive years: 1983, 1984 and 1985. “That was when PCs were new,” he said, “and just about everyone thought IBM would rule the world.” Now it’s Apple’s world. Apple is the most widely held stock in American mutual fund portfolios. IBM, the former undisputed heavyweight champion, isn’t even in the running anymore. It ranks 62nd, according to a Morningstar analysis performed at my request. IBM is still an important company, but it is struggling. Investors judge it to be worth less than one-quarter of Apple’s market value today. What happened to IBM — how it became this small, in comparison with Apple — is worth remembering. IBM thrived for years afterward, but just as Jobs had predicted, it turned out to be vulnerable to disruptive change, as all big companies are. For decades now, IBM has engaged in a sometimes painful transition, and as it revealed in its quarterly earnings report last week, it is still hurting: Its revenues have declined and it has endured wrenching business shifts. My colleague Steve Lohr wrote last week that IBM has been getting out of slow-growing old businesses, like personal computers, disk drives, low-end server computers and chip manufacturing — but its new initiatives in fields like data analytics, cloud computing and mobile apps for corporate customers haven’t entirely succeeded yet. In a turnabout, IBM’s mobile app strategy relies on a partnership with the current giant, its old nemesis Apple. IBM is leveraging its prowess with supercomputers and artificial intelligence with a new initiative, Watson Health, that includes Apple. That alliance could help both companies grow — in Apple’s case, by ensuring that its products work more seamlessly in corporate environments where IBM is deeply entrenched. Rapid growth, after all, isn’t a sure thing, especially when you’re already the biggest company in the world. IBM has proved that. Sooner or later, Apple investors will have to take that lesson to heart.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon earnings: revenue $22.7B, +15% Y/Y, net loss of $57M, but shares surge on cloud computing revenue, profitability: The retailer lost 12 cents a share for a net loss of $57 million, as revenue rose 15 percent — a little more steeply than expected, especially in light of the company’s size — to $22.72 billion. Analysts had projected a loss of 13 cents a share on revenue of $22.39 billion, according to Thomson Financial. Last year, Amazon had a profit of 23 cents a share in the first quarter. AWS had net sales of $1.57 billion in the first quarter, up 49 percent from $1.05 billion in the first quarter of 2014. Shares in Amazon usually move forcefully after the earnings release — often down, but strikingly up after fourth-quarter results were announced three months ago. The stock has risen about 25 percent since then. In regular trading Thursday, the stock barely moved, but were up 8% in extended trading.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAWS is unexpectedly large $1.57B quarterly revenue - and very profitable! Amazon.com Inc\\'s first-quarter revenue grew more than expected as rising sales in North America and its burgeoning cloud-computing services unit offset new business investments, boosting its shares nearly 7 percent. The e-commerce company for the first time broke out financial details of its secretive cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, on Thursday, saying revenue jumped almost 50 percent to $1.57 billion, or about 7 percent of total revenue. The unit\\'s operating income grew 8 percent to $265 million. Amazon shares rose $26.01 to $416 in extended trading, after closing slightly higher at $389.99 on Nasdaq. Chief Executive Jeff Bezos revealed in a statement that Amazon Web Services is a $5 billion business and its growth is accelerating. \"We\\'re putting a lot of capex (capital expenditure) there, and we think over time we will be able to generate significant free cash flow,\" Chief Financial Officer Tom Szkutak said on a conference call. Cloud computing has turned out to be more lucrative than expected, Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter noted. \"Amazon\\'s Web service is profitable, and apparently was a year ago as well. Everybody thought it was losing money ... and is probably a bit smaller than people thought it was.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAmazon\\'s North America business up 24% Y/Y, international business continues to drag - down Y/Y Amazon\\'s sales from North America rose 24 percent to $13.4 billion in the quarter ended March 31, the company said. The company said it is continuing to build its Prime delivery business with its one-hour delivery service called Prime Now. It is also investing in original content for its Prime instant video services and devices. The international unit, which accounts for about 35 percent of total sales, remained a drag, with sales for the quarter slipping 1.77 percent to $7.75 billion. Szkutak said Amazon has stepped up its investments, particularly in India, and remains selective in China. \"The growth rate in India is very rapid,\" he said. \"A big part of the challenge there is helping sellers to succeed and grow their online businesses.\"\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft earnings: revenue $21.7B, +6% Y/Y, net income $4.99B; shares up on cloud strength:  Microsoft reported net income of $4.99 billion, or 61 cents a share, down from $5.66 billion, or 68 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Revenue rose to $21.73 billion from $20.4 billion a year ago, Microsoft said. Wall Street analysts were especially pleased that Microsoft exceeded their profit forecasts. The average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters was for earnings of 51 cents a share and revenue of $21.06 billion. Microsoft shares jumped more than 3 percent in after-hours trading. Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said that Wall Street was expecting to give Microsoft a C grade for the quarter after the company delivered disappointing results over the holiday period. He said the company ended up delivering a B-plus performance, adding that “it appears Microsoft is back on the right track after a head-scratching performance last quarter.”\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft Cloud Strength: Azure revenue is $1.57B quarterly revenue A bright spot for Microsoft was the growth in its cloud business, a catchall category that includes Office applications that are sold as subscriptions and its Azure business, through which it rents computing capacity in Microsoft data centers to clients. The company said its commercial cloud revenue grew 106 percent during the quarter, and amounts to a $6.3 billion annual business based on its recent performance.  The company said its commercial cloud-related revenue for the quarter more than doubled, and was now running at $6.3 billion a year. Amazon.com Inc said on Thursday its quarterly cloud revenue rose almost 50 percent to $1.57 billion, suggesting a similar annual number. Microsoft\\'s overall revenue rose 6 percent to $21.7 billion, above Wall Street\\'s average forecast of $21.1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Taking out the effects of the strong U.S. dollar on currency rates, Microsoft said revenue would have risen 9 percent. Earnings per share declined to 61 cents per share from 68 cents in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had expected 51 cents, on average.\\n\\n\\nGoogle earnings: $17.3B, +12% Y/Y, net income $3.6B; shares up despite earnings miss: Google on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue of $17.3 billion, up 12 percent over the same period last year. That figure was driven substantially downward by the strong dollar. Absent currency fluctuations, revenues would have been up 17 percent. Google missed Wall Street’s expectations for the sixth time in the last nine quarters. Net revenue, which excludes payments to the company’s advertising partners, was $13.9 billion, up from $12.2 billion. Analysts had expected net revenue of $14.04 billion, according to Bloomberg. Net income in the first quarter, which ended March 31, was $3.6 billion, or $5.20 a share, compared with $3.5 billion, or $5.04 a share. Excluding the cost of stock options and related tax benefits, Google’s profit was $6.57 a share, compared with $6.27 a year ago. Analysts had expected $6.63 a share. During its first-quarter earnings call on Thursday, the search giant tried to assuage analysts’ long-running concern that its growth is slowing because mobile phones, with their tiny screens that can be clumsy to click through, are a less lucrative advertising medium than the desktop computers with which the Google empire was built. In doing so, Patrick Pichette, the company’s chief financial officer, who is leaving, noted that Google’s YouTube video site has been growing fast but for now is simply a less lucrative business than Google’s highly targeted search ads. Google shares were up about 3 percent in after-hours trading.\\n\\n\\nWith Mi 4i Smartphone, Xiaomi Turns to India: For those who think the West is the center of the tech world, Xiaomi has a different opinion. The upstart Chinese maker of smartphones just hosted its biggest event outside of its home country to introduce a new flagship phone, and it wasn’t in the United States or even Europe, it was in India. The phone, the Mi 4i, was introduced on Thursday by Hugo Barra, a former Google executive. The phone includes impressive specs and special features in India — like extra language options — and will go on sale April 30 in India, and in May in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. As the company’s Lei Jun, Xiaomi’s chief executive, normally does in China, Mr. Barra guided an enthusiastic audience through the phone’s range of features. But for all the attention Xiaomi gives to technical details and its operating system, the denouement came when Mr. Barra announced the price of the phone: 12,999 rupees, or roughly $200, a low price for a flagship device. While there are a huge number of reasons for Xiaomi, valued at $45 billion after its latest December fund-raising round, not to push into markets like the United States — from potential patent lawsuits to having to develop relationships with carriers — perhaps the primary reason Xiaomi is entering India is because the country looks quite a bit like China several years ago. Most importantly, Indians are expected to buy far more smartphones this year than they did in 2014, according to IDC, the research firm. IDC estimates that the country will buy 111 million smartphones this year and 149 million units in 2016. India is expected to outpace the United States in sales in the coming years. Yet the $200 price point makes the Mi 4i far cheaper than the leading phones from other companies like Samsung, HTC and Motorola. Even so, in India, the Xiaomi phone still ranks as expensive, about double the price of the cheap mainstays of companies like Micromax.\\n\\n\\nQuikr valued around $890M in latest funding round: Classifieds site Quikr, which raised $150 million in fresh funding from existing investors besides a new investor Steadview Capital Management, was valued at around $892 million, as per a note by its Swedish investor Investment AB Kinnevik. Kinnevik said its own stake had an implied value of $158 million and the fair value of ownership of its holding is $93.2 million which gives a fair value of around $517 million to Quikr. Kinnevik had also participated in the latest round with an infusion of $40 million as part of a larger $150 million funding early this month. It also saw participation from other existing investor Tiger Global. With the September deal, the total capital raised by Quikr stood at around $350 million. The latest funding comes barely seven months after it raised $60 million in a fresh round of funding led by Tiger Global with participation from its existing investors, including Matrix Partners India, Nokia Growth Partners, Norwest Venture Partners, Omidyar Network, Warburg Pincus and eBay Inc, besides Kinnevik. In the last disclosure, Kinnevik had pegged a fair value of Quikr at around $340 million. Founded in 2008 by Chulet and Jiby Thomas (who quit the firm later), Quikr was originally started as Kijiji India. The firm later rebranded to Quikr. It is a large scale cross-category classifieds business with over 30 million consumers. These consumers come to Quikr to sell, buy, rent or find products and services in a variety of categories such as electronics and household goods, real estate, cars, bikes, jobs and services. The firm claims that small businesses across 1,000 cities are using the site. It recently announced the launch of a new classifieds website for real estate called quikrhomes.com to allow B2C as well as C2C discovery of properties up for sale as well as those available for rent. It is also launching separate verticals and new sites with separate URLs for around half a dozen areas. Early this year, Quikr launched Nxt, an instant messaging service to enable buyers and sellers to interact with greater convenience and privacy.\\n\\n\\nTwitter invests in Swirl, a beacon-based ad-targeting startup: Swirl, which offers a platform for retailers and brands to market to customers via beacons, announced Thursday it has raised $18 million from a handful of investors, including Twitter Ventures.Other investors in the Series C round include Hearst Ventures and Softbank Capital, both who have funded Swirl in the past. Beacons are a young, Bluetooth-powered technology that provides the potential for companies to specifically target in-store customers. A retailer could realize that a customer has been dwelling near its TVs for 15 minutes, and send a coupon for a 4K TV via a smartphone push notification. In one recent success story, American Eagle Outfitters found it was able to increase the likelihood of a customer trying on clothes when it used beacons to send customers a push notification. Still, beacons have a ways to go before gaining mainstream adoption. A sticking point has been ensuring customers have the relevant app installed on their smartphone, which acts as a tripwire of sorts and tips off the store of the consumer’s location. If a customer doesn’t have the right app, they’ll never receive the notification. This is what makes the interest of social networks such as Twitter and Facebook so noteworthy. “Everybody’s got one of these widely distributed apps on their phone,” said Swirl chief executive Hilmi Ozguc. “That’s where the whole picture is completed, and that’s what’s exciting about this.” Facebook announced in January it is testing using beacons at eight stores in New York City. Twitter declined to comment on its interest in beacons. With a treasure trove of information about users, social networks are already well-positioned to target advertisements at an extremely granular level. Facebook and Twitter could potentially take this another step forward, and fine-tune ads for users’ exact locations at a given moment. They could likely charge a hefty premium for such ads. “There’s a vast market potential here. And it’s going to be a big source of new mobile advertising revenue for a lot of companies,” Ozguc said. “From Facebook to Twitter, to you name it. So I think you’ll see a lot of these big guys start to make some moves and bets on the space and start offering the benefits they bring, this massive audience reach.”\\n\\n\\nZomato embeds Uber button to its own app for hailing cabs to reach restaurants in 13 countries: Zomato.com, owned and operated by Gurgaon-based Zomato Media Pvt Ltd, has entered into a partnership with Uber Technologies Inc (Uber) to enable users to book cabs to the restaurant they are planning to eat at, right from its own app. The feature has gone live for Zomato users in London and South Africa, and will now be rolled out to users in other key markets. The partnership would cover Zomato users in 27 cities across 13 countries where both the firms have a presence – India, Australia, Canada, the UK, South Africa, Indonesia, New Zealand, Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, Turkey, UAE and the US. “This partnership makes eating out more convenient with the Zomato app connecting to Uber services seamlessly,” said Pankaj Chaddah, co-founder and COO, Zomato. “Through this API integration, Zomato users in 13 countries will now be able to reach those hidden gems in their cities seamlessly and in style,” said Eric Alexander, head of business, Asia, Uber. How it works:Once a user has found a place to dine at or have drinks at using the Zomato app, a single tap on the Uber button on the restaurant page will allow him/her to find the nearest Uber cab. In addition to seeing the estimated fare and how long it will take for the Uber to arrive, one will also be able to choose the Uber service that best suits one’s need.\\n\\n\\nDetails on Alibaba\\'s Cloud: After keeping the world waiting for nine years, Amazon finally broke out earnings for its Amazon Web Services on Thursday. The $1.57 billion in sales for the quarter suggest that the company is far ahead of rivals in the cloud computing business. But as AWS expands globally, it faces strong competition from a familiar foe: Alibaba. Amazon already has 28 percent of the worldwide market for cloud infrastructure services, followed by Microsoft with 10 percent, according to a report by Synergy Research Group. To expand its share, Amazon has spent the past few years plunking down gigantic data centers around the globe to help it quickly serve customers outside the U.S. In some cases, it did so to abide by local regulations as to where these servers should be located. Unlike many of its rivals, Amazon has targeted China, opening a data center near Beijing in 2014. Alibaba opened its first overseas data center in Silicon Valley in March to help provide cloud computing services to Chinese customers, Yu says. At the time, Alibaba said it served a 22.8 percent market share of the Chinese infrastructure-as-a-service market in the first half of 2014. It currently has five data center hubs in Asia: Beijing, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Hong Kong, and Shenzhen. Like Amazon, Alibaba has a strategic partnership with Intel to do custom chips. Unlike Amazon, it has been more public about its experimentation with low-power server processors based on designs from ARM Holdings. Alibaba joined a cross-industry engineering organization named Linaro in April to develop software to get the most out of new chip designs from ARM. The company is looking at ARM closely, says Yu, and will have more details to share next year. By adopting a non-standard processor architecture, Alibaba would be able to save money on its mammoth electricity bills by tailoring its chips to its software. In doing so, it would join a small club of companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, with the scale and engineering talent needed to make such a move.  Aliyun has more than 1,200 employees, 80 percent of whom are engineers, says Yu. The company began looking at doing heavy engineering on hardware and software about 10 years ago, predating the formation of its cloud.  As is typical of large Chinese technology companies, Alibaba is woven into China\\'s bureaucracy. The company currently has strategic agreements with 12 Chinese provinces, regions, and municipalities, as well as an undisclosed number of government agencies, including the China Central Government Procurement Agency. That guarantees it a lot of business in China and ensures that its infrastructure is stress-tested in the same way that large clouds from Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are. This helps to make its service more resilient.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

Advertising sales gained 46 percent to $3.32 billion from a year earlier, and would have increased 55 percent excluding currency fluctuations, Facebook said. Ad sales make up about 94 percent of the company’s annual revenue. Facebook said its main application has 1.44 billion monthly active users, compared with 1.39 billion in the fourth quarter and analysts’ estimates of 1.43 billion. About 73 percent of ad revenue came from mobile phones, an increase from about 59 percent a year earlier, the company reported. more people are visiting Facebook daily, with the company reporting daily active users of 936 million on average in March, an increase of 17 percent from a year earlier. Facebook’s sales failed to meet analysts’ estimates for the first time since April 2012, and shares declined as much as 4.3 percent in extended trading after closing at $84.63. The stock has increased 8.5 percent so far this year, compared with a 2.4 percent rise in the S&P 500 Index. Shift to Mobile Accelerates: Facebook is now so thoroughly a mobile service that its original website may soon become a footnote in the company’s financial statements. The world’s largest social network reported on Wednesday that almost three-quarters of its advertising revenue and most of its 1.44 billion users came from cellphones and other mobile devices in the first quarter of the year. And Facebook is beginning to make a similar transition from text to video, with its users already watching four billion videos a day, an average of four per person (although the view may be more like a glance, since Facebook considers three seconds long enough to count). Usage in Asia continues to grow: In Asia, the headline number is that Facebook has now grown to 471 million monthly active users (MAUs) in Q1 2015, up from 390 million MAUs the same period the year earlier. That’s out of a global total of 1.44 billion MAUs in the newest figures.\\n\\n\\nAs Amazon parties on, some large fund managers take their leave: For many years, investors have been very tolerant as Amazon.com has sacrificed profits for rapid growth in sales and as it built new businesses. That patience may finally be wearing thin. The average large-cap fund that holds Amazon has 1.4 percent of its assets in the stock, down 23 percent from this time last year, according to the latest available Lipper data. There are 116 funds with more than $1 billion under management that have either reduced or sold all of their holdings in the Internet retailer over the past 12 months. They include such well-known names as Fidelity Contrafund, Washington Mutual Investors Fund, Touchstone Sands Select Growth fund and the T. Rowe Price Growth fund. Some investors and analysts said that such a drop in fund ownership - in a period when Amazon\\'s shares have been climbing - suggests that large-cap managers increasingly see the company as over-valued, particularly at a time when it is spending tons of cash branching off into everything from selling its own smartphone to producing a Woody Allen TV series. What strikes some investors as different this time around is the widening divergence between Amazon\\'s valuation and that of its large technology peers like Apple Inc and Google Inc, both of which are growing at similar rates. Amazon trades at 16.2 times its book value. Apple, by comparison, trades at 6.5 times its book value, according to Thomson Reuters data. Google, another company which has expanded beyond its core business into lines as far afield as driverless cars, is valued at 3.4 times its book value. The others made big profits last year while Amazon was unprofitable. While Google has posted more than $68 billion in profits before taxes between 2010-2014, Amazon has netted just $2.6 billion over the same time frame, according to Thomson Reuters data. The cashflow is a better gauge of how the company is doing, according to Robert S. Peck, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, who downgraded the company to \"neutral\" on March 9 because he views the shares as overvalued. He estimates its free cash flow from operations will climb to $8.9 billion this fiscal year from $3.4 billion in 2010, yet nearly all of that additional cash is being used to expand into businesses like grocery delivery or web services.\\n\\n\\nEbay earnings: revenue up 4% Y/Y to $4.45B; marketplace revenue shrinks first time since 2009, but PayPal growth compensates. Stock up 6%. EBay on Wednesday reported earnings of $626 million for the quarter that ended March 31, swinging back to profitability after a $2.32 billion loss in the same period a year ago that included a hefty one-time tax charge. Excluding the charge, the company’s income grew 4.8 percent from a year ago. Revenue rose 4 percent, to $4.45 billion, surpassing estimates of $4.42 billion. The results illustrate a divergence in eBay’s two businesses. Sales in the company’s marketplace business fell 4 percent to $2.07 billion from a year ago, a lackluster showing that continued the trend of declining e-commerce growth over the past four quarters. It is the unit’s first year-over-year revenue drop since 2009. In contrast, the company’s PayPal electronic payments unit posted revenue of $2.1 billion, up 14 percent from $1.85 billion a year ago. It was the first time PayPal’s sales exceeded that of the marketplace business. With the separation, the company is also cutting 2,400 positions, or 7 percent of its global work force. EBay has also said it would explore a sale or a possible initial public offering of eBay Enterprise, the warehouse and logistics unit for third-party sellers. A split may leave the marketplace business particularly vulnerable. For months, executives have pointed to problems with Google’s search algorithms and fallout from a huge security breach as reasons for weak e-commerce momentum. The company is in the process of updating its systems to improve search results both on eBay and in outside search engines, Mr. Donahoe said, a process that could take more than a few quarters. Analysts are eager to see positive results. PayPal is still growing, fueled by high-performing assets like Braintree and Venmo, which are mobile-focused payments divisions that eBay acquired in recent years. Venmo, Mr. Donahoe has said, is enormously popular with young audiences. Braintree is angling to reinvent PayPal’s payments business to be easier to use on mobile devices. But there is wariness that such growth will not come soon enough, especially as large companies like Apple, as well as payments start-ups like Stripe and Adyen, gain market share.\\n\\n\\nAlgorithms to find online trolls - trolls focus on a small number of stories and attract the most responses: Scientists have figured out how to tell when someone is an online troll: Spotting an online troll is pretty easy for your average Internet user: They\\'re the jerk hijacking otherwise earnest online conversations for their own amusement, often with the help of straw man arguments and profanities. And a lot of online moderation schemes today rely on a large-scale version of this individual model: There are literally people whose job is reviewing posts that users marked as abusive or otherwise in violation of a site\\'s commenting guidelines. But there could be a better way. What if there was software that could predict if a user was going to be a troll before their behavior could tear online communities apart? That\\'s one of the questions that a study submitted this month to the 9th International Conference on Web and Social Media by researchers at Stanford and Cornell universities hopes to answer. The researchers --  Justin Cheng, Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Jure Leskovec -- waded through 18 months of user activity in the comment sections of CNN.com, conservative political news site Breitbart.com, and gaming site IGN.com looking for antisocial activity. Using data provided by commenting platform Disqus, they were eventually able to identify what they called \"future banned users\" -- commenters who were later blocked from the site for bad behavior. Those users, they found, tended to focus their comments on a small number of stories and were more likely to post things otherwise irrelevant to the overall conversation. Trolls\\' behavior also tended to get worse over time, according to the researchers -- and they were generally successful at getting a rise out of those in an online community. \"They receive more replies than average users, suggesting that they might be successful in luring others into fruitless, time-consuming discussions,\" the researchers said. Some platforms are looking at ways to limit the impact of disruptive users without actually banning them. Twitter, for instance, said this week that it is testing out a product that flags potentially abusive tweets based on a \"wide range of signals,\" such as account age and similarities to previous messages that staff deemed abusive, and then limits their reach. But regardless of how sites approach it, online harassment is a serious problem: Some 40 percent of adult Internet users have experienced it, according to a Pew Research Center study last year. And controlling the bad actors responsible behind some of the most aggressive behavior is a struggle for many online sites, including Facebook and Twitter.\\n\\n\\nStart-Up Blends Old-Fashioned Matchmaking and Algorithms: Dating Ring uses an algorithm to generate potential matches and then a matchmaker combs through those to hand-select dates. The company’s hybrid model represents the tip of a backlash against mobile dating apps like Tinder, where matches are based almost solely on appearance. Mark Brooks, an Internet dating analyst and consultant, said although there is still plenty of interest in online dating, “People also want relationships that begin based on more than your gut reaction to a photo,” he said. “This model is very new, this merging of Internet dating and matchmakers.” Several new start-ups, like SparkStarter, Hinge and Coffee Meets Bagel, don’t use matchmakers per se but do use connections — friends and friends of friends on Facebook — to humanize the process and move beyond algorithmic matching. Dave Evans, the founder of Digicraft, an online dating consultancy, said, “The whole industry now is built on smoke, mirrors and a lot of marketing. We’re at the point where I don’t care how old you are, what you find interesting, even where you live. I’m just going to swipe left or right based on how you look.” Melissa Brady, a 37-year-old Dating Ring client in White Plains, N.Y., loves the idea of a matchmaker being involved. “It makes me more excited to go on the date, because I have more hope for it,” she said. Ms. Brady has used other dating sites, including OKCupid and Coffee Meets Bagel, but found those dates less well-suited to her. A key part of Dating Ring’s model is user feedback — given to the matchmaker after every date — which is then used to keep improving a dater’s experience. The matchmakers are all women who work at least 10 hours a week and want a flexible schedule. The company has begun operating in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Boston. Dating Ring charges $240 for three months with one introduction each week; anyone can become a member of the database free and be eligible for matches with paying clients. The company’s V.I.P. service includes a one-hour, in-person consultation and multiple Skype feedback sessions in a package tailored to the client. The average price for a V.I.P. package is $3,500 and for that, a client gets five dates in five months. Ms. Kay and Ms. Tessler have also begun setting up speed-dating events for members in New York and San Francisco. “They sold out within two days,” Ms. Kay said. Revenue now averages about $35,000 a month but growth fluctuates, Ms. Kay said. “Some months it’s 50 percent and other months it’s 5 percent,” she says. “Right now, we’re pretty much breaking even.” The company received a $100,000 initial investment from Y Combinator and raised an additional $255,000 from angels.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZomato rolls out online ordering of food in updated app, to allow cash-less payments at restaurants: Zomato.com, has entered the online ordering space as a mobile-only offering. Its updated version of mobile app comes integrated with a meal ordering option. The service has gone live with 1,000 restaurants currently and users can look for those outlets offering the option within the ‘Nearby’ tab in the app. It then throws up those names which offer online ordering as a sub-set of the overall list of restaurants in the location. We have not checked the process throughout but it involves a mobile verification while placing the order. The users would have to make cash payments as restaurant delivery boys come with the package. The updated app also shows an option of cashless payments which is not active yet. Zomato spokesperson told Techcircle.in that this option is currently active only in Dubai and will soon be launched in India. This would allow users to pay after a meal at a partner restaurant through the Zomato app, instead of paying cash or using credit/debit cards to settle bills at the restaurants.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba Expands Seller App - Wants Merchants to Ditch their PCs: The ecommerce titan has rolled out new tools into its Taobao mobile app (pictured above) that allow the marketplace’s 8.4 million annual active merchants to run their stores solely from their phones. The shift to mobile-only is optional for now, but an Alibaba representative tells Tech in Asia that two million merchants have already opted for the smartphone-only method in the two weeks since the new tools have been available in beta. “The growing adoption of smartphones and mobile shopping in China means that online merchants should shift their focus from PC to mobile,” said Zhang Kuo, director of Alibaba Group’s mobile business division, in a statement. That means an online seller will run their store and add new products to it just from their phone rather than using the desktop browser-based interface. To make that process easier on mobile, merchants can scan a new product’s barcode with their phone to add it to the store’s inventory using the Taobao app. “To complete product dispatch procedures, merchants can simply scan barcodes on shipping bills to enter package tracking numbers, without the need to manually input them,” added a spokesperson. Brand-new Taobao merchants can even start their store from scratch within the Taobao app without the need to fire up a laptop. Across Taobao and sister site Tmall (a marketplace aimed at larger merchants and major brands), Alibaba has 334 million shoppers. Of the total RMB 787 billion (US$126.4 billion) in consumer spending (GMV) on the two estores in Q4 2014, 42 percent of that tally was spent by people shopping on mobile devices.\\n\\n\\nAmazon Targets Priceline, Expedia With New Hotel Booking Site: In its push to expand beyond an online store for books and merchandise, Amazon.com Inc. is entering the travel-reservations business. The e-commerce retailer Tuesday introduced Amazon Destinations, which provides maps, lodging deals and information about restaurants at popular weekend getaways near Los Angeles, New York City and Seattle. The new site is a travel-focused expansion of the Seattle-based company’s Amazon Local, which connects Amazon shoppers with deals close to them. The world’s biggest online retailer by revenue will be competing with Priceline Group Inc., Expedia Inc., startup Airbnb Inc. and others for a piece of the online hotel booking market. Tourism in the U.S. is a $960 billion industry, according to researcher IBISWorld.\\n\\n\\nYahoo Q1 Earnings: Revenue $1.23B, +9% Y/Y, Net Income: $21M, down from $312M Y/Y; Shares Fall, Then Rise on Hope of Alibaba Stake Sale: At Yahoo, the turnaround that investors are hoping for remains elusive. The Internet company reported first-quarter financial results that showed strong growth in newer areas like mobile advertising. But costs rose even faster, depressing profits. Yahoo posted net income of $21 million, or 2 cents a share, down sharply from the $312 million, or 29 cents a share, the Internet company reported a year ago. Excluding stock-based compensation and other items, Yahoo made a profit of 15 cents a share, falling short of the 18 cents a share that Wall Street had expected on that basis. Revenue for the first quarter was $1.23 billion, up slightly from the $1.13 billion that the company brought in during the same period last year, as search revenue and even old-fashioned display ads increased. After deducting payments to advertising partners, however, revenue was $1.04 billion, below the $1.07 billion predicted by analysts. Yahoo’s stock initially fell in after-hours trading following the release of its results. But it rose during Yahoo’s conference call with analysts, when Ms. Mayer said that Yahoo had hired advisers to explore how to maximize the value of the company’s 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, which is worth nearly $9 billion. Since Ms. Mayer joined the company in 2012, Yahoo’s stock has traded more on the value of its investments in Yahoo Japan and Alibaba, a leading Chinese e-commerce company, than on its core business. In January, she announced plans to spin off Yahoo’s 15.4 percent stake in Alibaba. In Yahoo’s operating businesses, Ms. Mayer is trying to refocus the company around mobile apps, native ads, video services and the Tumblr social network, while reducing staffing in the company’s other divisions, like its traditional web offerings. In the first quarter, Yahoo cut net employment by 1,100 jobs, Ms. Mayer said on the call. Since her arrival, she has reduced the number of full-time employees by 2,800 jobs, or 20 percent. Last week, Ms. Mayer renewed the company’s partnership with Microsoft on search results and advertising, which accounted for 35 percent of Yahoo’s revenue last year. Under that deal, the two companies will continue to work together for five more years, with Yahoo now getting the ability to serve up its own search results and ads for up to 49 percent of queries.\\n\\n\\nShyp, an On-Demand Mailing Service, Raises $50 Million: Shyp, a company that lets customers summon workers to quickly pick up, pack and ship parcels, said on Tuesday that it has raised $50 million in venture capital, the largest funding round in the start-up’s history. The new round values Shyp at just above $250 million, according to two people with knowledge of the financial terms, who requested anonymity because the deal talks were private. A Shyp spokesman declined to comment on the company’s valuation. The funding is another significant bet on the future of on-demand start-ups by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the storied venture capital firm that led Shyp’s new financing round and that recently won a case against a former partner who alleged gender bias at the firm. With the round, which also includes participation by previous investors Homebrew and SherpaVentures, John Doerr, a Kleiner executive, will join the board of directors at Shyp. Kleiner has also put money in to other on-demand companies like Uber and DoorDash. Uber, the on-demand ride-hailing service, has also dabbled in the business of moving goods from one place to another, signaling its ambitions to become a way to transport anything and everything to different places around the world. Shyp, on the other hand, piggybacks on existing transportation networks like UPS, FedEx and the United States Postal Service. Instead of doing all of the shipping itself, Shyp hires contract workers to pick up items from customers, and pack and ship them, eliminating the hassle of standing in line at the post office or finding the proper packaging supplies to send the items. “We asked ourselves, what is the ideal way to ship something?” said Kevin Gibbon, chief executive of Shyp. “Can we scale this business to happen in multiple cities? Can we improve operations and logistics to make it cheaper and faster?” Mr. Gibbon said his service was complementary to the shipping networks already in place, as Shyp’s local logistics networks gather many packages together to hand them off to the actual companies doing the transportation, a task that he said would cost companies like DHL and FedEx much more in time, labor and resources to offer. Shyp makes a $5 service fee on each package it delivers. Shyp also announced it is opening up a pilot version of its service in Los Angeles; it currently operates in San Francisco, New York City and Miami.\\n\\n\\n\"Notifications Are The Next Platform\" TC Columnist Opines Push Notifications Replacing Search as Primary Engagement Point: Search (largely Google) has long been the access and discovery point for web services. This model was pull-driven (i.e. we proactively find information on websites as we need), and worked pretty well as large category killers (Facebook, Amazon) owned the lion’s share of traffic (and revenue). Google was happily profitable owning the distribution channel. The mobile world started out as a pull-driven model — discovery and access was/is largely driven by a combination of the app store and the “grid of apps.” This model, however, is starting to break, as some significant trends are driving it to failure. Primary among these is the volume of information that’s now available and regularly accessed; we have hundreds of apps on our phone (though we only actively engage with a handful), and without any real category killers, consumers are swapping new apps in and out at a regular pace. Most importantly, our engagement is now defined by push-driven notifications rather than the traditional pull-driven experience. We’re “hunting and pecking” through our app grid a lot less; the apps that notify us (without over-notifying to the point of uninstall) are rewarded with our engagement (and our dollars). Based on this data, our fundamental belief is that notifications represent the future access and discovery point for mobile services — that notifications will be the starting point (or “front door”) for all of the interactions on your phone. Snowball data shows that over 60 percent of notifications are social messages (almost 40 per day). Will Facebook Messenger subsume the notification panel? Our data shows some interesting trends. As noted above, 60 percent of all notifications are social messages. However, our data also shows that users on average interact with 5.5 messaging apps weekly (does not count email)*. Though users regularly use over 5 social messaging apps, Facebook + WhatsApp represents an astounding 79 percent of all messaging by volume. This is incredibly high. Notifications represent the future app interface, and Facebook is making a bold play to own them. Whatever party is successful will have to be thoughtful about social messages, as they represent the bulk of notifications by volume. What we’re seeing today is the first step toward monetization of the OS and the emergence of a new important distribution channel, and apps and platforms would be wise to think critically about it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle Adds ‘Mobile Friendliness’ to Its Search Criteria: (More here) Many businesses around the world could wake up on Tuesday to discover their search ranking has been downgraded. After a monthslong warning period, Google will add “mobile friendliness” to the 200 or so factors it uses to list websites on its search engine. As a result, websites that don’t meet Google’s criteria will tumble in its all-important rankings. Google has made several big changes. Companies will be docked for shortcomings like displaying links that are hard to click or forcing users to scroll horizontally on a lopsided site. In addition, the company recently announced that in certain cases it would also use information contained within apps as a ranking factor for mobile searches performed on phones that run its Android software. while Google remains the dominant search engine on every computing platform, its grasp on the mobile market is slipping in the face of increased competition from “native” apps expressly meant for mobile devices. Google grabbed 68 percent of the $8.75 billion in mobile search revenues last year, down from an 81 percent share in 2012. But the mobile ad market more than tripled to $8.7 billion over that time, according to eMarketer. Google has for years been the world’s most widely used search engine and a significant generator of traffic to websites, from major news organizations to mom-and-pop shops. Websites have little choice but to adapt to what Google considers important characteristics. “People will kick and scream, they always do,” said Rebecca Lieb, an industry analyst at the Altimeter Group. “But ultimately this serves as a wake-up call that things change and Google is going to change with it.” Google’s search algorithm is a closely guarded secret, so the company would not say exactly how much mobile would factor into rankings. Still, it said in a blog post that the change would have “a significant impact” on search results, and it has tried to prepare websites by telegraphing the move two months in advance and giving them tips on how to improve their performance.\\n\\n\\nIBM Earnings: 12th straight quarterly decline in revenue; shares flat on earnings beat. More here IBM reported earnings on Monday that surpassed Wall Street’s estimates, helped by solid sales of its new mainframe computers, even as its revenue fell. Cloud computing revenue surged 75 percent, and IBM’s large data analytics business grew by more than 20 percent, excluding the effect of currency fluctuations. IBM reported a 5 percent decline in net income to $2.4 billion. But the company reported a 4 percent increase, to $2.9 billion, in operating profits from continuing operations. On an earnings-per-share basis, earnings rose 9 percent to $2.91 a share. That was well above the consensus of Wall Street analysts of $2.80 a share. Revenue for the quarter fell 12 percent to $19.6 billion. But the falloff was almost entirely attributable to a strong dollar and the company’s planned exits from less-profitable businesses, especially its industry-standard data center computers, which it sold to Lenovo of China last fall. Most of IBM’s business is outside the United States, so a stronger dollar translates to lower reported revenue. In fact, eight percentage points of the revenue decline, or $1.7 billion, was because of the currency effect. The mainframe business remains critical to IBM. The machines themselves contribute only about 2 percent of the company’s revenue today. But when mainframe-related software, storage, services and financing are included, the overall business represents an estimated 24 percent of corporate revenue and 37 percent of operating profits. Take away the currency effect and the sold-off operations, and IBM’s revenue would have been flat from the year-earlier quarter. Even so, flat revenue is not growth. IBM’s reported revenue has declined for 12 consecutive quarters. Some of the decline has been by design as IBM sheds operations with lower profit margins, as it has for years, getting out of personal computers, disk drives and most recently low-end server computers and chip manufacturing. In a research report last week, Mr. Sacconaghi identified three major challenges confronting IBM. Cloud computing, he wrote, will most likely hurt IBM’s traditional hardware and software business more than the growth in its own cloud business will help. The second threat, according to Mr. Sacconaghi, is the overall effect on hardware and software sales of the decline in its business that sells large servers running the Unix operating system. The third danger, he wrote, is the decline in its traditional outsourcing business, in which IBM runs the computer operations of its corporate customers. Shares in the company were mostly flat in after-hours trading.\\n\\n\\nIndia\\'s Central bank working on integration between e-commerce firms and banks: India\\'s central bank is working on improving the integration between e-commerce firms and the country\\'s banking systems, a deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said on Monday. \"One area which we will now be looking at very closely, which is emerging, is how to provide integration between e-commerce platforms and banks,\" Deputy Governor H.R. Khan said at a banking industry event. India\\'s fast growing e-commerce market is valued at about $12 billion, however most shoppers still pay for their online purchases through cash at the doorstep. Khan said the central bank is also considering relaxing its requirement for a two-step authentication process for small transactions to make online payments smoother.\\n\\n\\nTwitter makes it possible to send personal messages to anyone: Twitter has made it possible for any user to send  a direct message to any other user, the company announced in a blog post Monday. Under the old settings, users could only direct-message those who followed them -- which sometimes meant that you had to ask people to follow you in order to send them a personal message. Now, those days are over, if you so choose. The change is opt-in, meaning that you don\\'t have to open your mailbox to the public if you don\\'t want to --  and that you can turn it off if you don\\'t like it. Twitter now also allows users to reply to anyone who sends them a direct message, regardless of who follows whom. If you want to turn on the feature, you can head to your settings page and select the \"Receive Direct  Messages from anyone\" option.  Once you do that, a new messaging button will appear on your mobile profile pages.  (To send a message from the Web, users should still go to the \"Messages\" tab and hit \"New Message.\") Twitter makes the case that if would be useful for businesses to field compliments or complaints from their customers without having to follow each of them individually. From a certain point of view, that makes sense: the company has been under pressure lately to up growth, revenue and engagement on its social network. Catering to businesses, and giving them an easy way to interact with customers, is a way to accomplish all those goals. But the feature can also increase the chances for spam or abuse.  To address those issues with this new feature, company said on its help page that users who\\'ve enabled this feature can block the sender to stop receiving messages. Obviously, this won\\'t prevent that sender from creating a new account and sending more messages -- a common trolling and spamming tactic -- but it\\'s a start.  Twitter also limits the number of direct messages anyone can send per day to 1,000 messages, and reserves the right to suspend an account temporarily if someone sends identical messages to multiple accounts in a short period of time.\\n\\n\\nIndia Startup Action: Freshdesk - first Google Capital investee outside the US - raises $50M in Series E funding from Tiger Global, Accel & Google Capital: Chennai- and US-based Freshdesk Inc, a provider of SaaS-based customer support platform for enterprises, has raised $50 million (Rs 314 crore) in Series E round of funding from its three existing investors. Tiger Global led the investment with Accel Partners and Google Capital also participating in the round, it said on Monday. The funds will be used in enhancing its products for its Freshdesk and Freshservice support platforms. Freshdesk is a cloud-based customer support platform, which aims to make it easy for brands to talk to their customers and for users to get in touch with businesses. It was started to provide email and website integration customer support, and later launched phone-based Twitter and Facebook support as well. It recently launched Freshservice, a SaaS IT service desk that is providing a modern alternative to complex legacy IT support systems. In June 2014, it had raised $31 million (Rs 195 crore) in a Series D round of funding led by Tiger Global. Original early-stage investor Accel also participated in that round which also saw Google Capital coming in as a new investor. Freshdesk competes with California-headquartered Zendesk Inc, which went public last year, and Salesforce.com, which offers customer service tools aimed at SMBs and larger enterprises. First Google Capital investee outside the US: Freshdesk was the first company outside the US to get backing from Google Capital, one of the two venture capital arms of the American search giant. While Google Ventures is more of an early stage investor, Google Capital focuses on the growth stage. So the doubling down on the Chennai-based startup recognizes that it’s on a fast track to scale up globally. “Freshdesk offers a compelling, modern customer experience delivered with cloud-scale cost and flexibility. We are excited to support Freshdesk with additional investment,” says Gene Frantz, general partner with Google Capital. According to Mathrubootham, the association added to the Freshdesk mojo in more ways than one. On the marketing front, especially. For example, after Google Capital came on board, an expert from Google India did an in-depth analysis that helped Freshdesk zero in on the geographies where there was high demand for its software. It threw up insights like where people were searching for Freshdesk software, how the overall market for customer support was evolving, and how Freshdesk’s marketing campaign was working in different markets. “It had county-by-county data for the US on how the Freshdesk brand was being perceived. It was brilliant. We were able to see where we were strong or weak and tweak our Google AdWords campaign to exploit it more,” Mathrubootham shares with Tech in Asia, adding that he is still working closely with Google on this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Advertising on Facebook gets Expensive, Some US Advertisers Switch back to TV: In the pre-Facebook era, with no budget for TV, newspaper or radio advertising, this would have meant we had no feasible way to gain quality exposure at a large scale for years. The Facebook advertising platform changed the course of that fate: We could now bootstrap our marketing — and that was revolutionary. Facebook offered a genuinely disruptive solution with three core strengths. First, it was one of the only platforms that allowed you to accurately measure your results in real-time, letting startups do what they do best — be agile. Second, it provided a superior level of targeting. Want to advertise only to women aged 20-23, who live in Minneapolis, have an annual income of $40K, drive a Mini Cooper and listen to Kendrick Lamar? You got it. To put this in context, to this day, Twitter doesn’t even know the gender of its followers. Third, and most importantly, combining real-time measurable results and superior targeting meant we could scale up quickly. Our marketing dollars on Facebook went a long way, and accurate targeting strategies on our end allowed our tiny budget to catapult the business to $1 million revenues in 2012. Facebook users are clicking more, and advertisers are paying for more clicks. But what are users really clicking on? Facebook calculates its CPCs as cost per every single click the user makes, whether it’s a Like, a share, or a visit to the brand’s website. But in the world of direct-response advertising, where “engagement” is an obscure term (whose impact on either sales or brand awareness no one knows how to measure), Likes and shares are worth absolutely nothing. This is how the real surge of Facebook prices is disguised: For us, Facebook CPCs — cost per any Facebook click — went up 50 percent from January 2014 to January 2015. But our real CPC value — cost per Facebook click to our website — went up by a whopping 127 percent in the same time period. That means that our real Facebook prices have more than doubled YoY, and a sizable chunk of that price increase is due to a service of Likes and shares valued at zero. Large corporate brands are unaware that a hefty share of their Facebook spend is attributed to Likes and shares; newcomers and the biggest spenders on Facebook don’t fully realize what they’re paying for. Same goes for Facebook’s targeting. Yes, Facebook offers superior targeting, but unless you’re running a narrow-niche business, the benefits of targeting have their limits. If I had a business selling on-demand $10K caviar jars that deliver only to Manhattan’s Upper East Side, I would be very excited by Facebook’s granular targeting. But the biggest spenders on Facebook are mass-market brands looking for mass-market exposure, and while they may have the option to target by specific neighborhoods, elementary schools or favorite books, they have no business reason to do so. Facebook may be developing more granular targeting capabilities, but its biggest spenders don’t really need it. Big spenders on Facebook are paying a premium for a service they don’t use or need. Today, with its 2014 $6 billion advertising revenues in the U.S. alone, Facebook is exhibiting all the alarming symptoms of a bubble: a service traded in high volumes at inflated and economically irrational prices. we took the plunge and launched a national TV campaign on MTV, Bravo, Lifetime and other networks. When the results were in, we had to rub our eyes to believe it: The CPAs on TV weren’t that far off from Facebook. If I needed any further proof of the Facebook bubble and its irrationally inflated prices, there it was: Acquiring new customers on Facebook with an expert online team, optimized spend and single-image creative was almost as expensive as a full-fledged TV campaign, with third-party agency fees, not-yet-optimized spending, and three different pricey video creatives. In 2015, we have scaled back on our Facebook spend by almost two-thirds and plan to divert that budget into TV advertising. And we’re not alone. Other startups such as Birchbox, Dollar Shave Club and BaubleBar are going into TV, as well, and at least in our case, this is entirely at the expense of Facebook.\\n\\n\\nThree Months After IPO, Box, Provider of Cloud-Computing Services, Faces Make-or-Break Moment: Box conducted an initial public offering in January, but had already raised more than $500 million privately. It employs 1,200 people and is considered on the cutting edge of a new generation of companies that provide services to big business customers over cloud-computing systems. Now comes the hard part — survival. Box today is worth $2.1 billion, but losses are continuing to add up while revenue is not growing enough to suit Wall Street’s tastes. The company’s shares are down 25 percent since it went public. And rival services from tech heavyweights like Amazon and Microsoft threaten Box’s business. In its last fiscal year, Box lost $167 million on revenue of $216 million. That was a 74 percent revenue gain from the year before, with a 5 percent bigger net loss. This year, revenue is expected to grow by about 30 percent, a marked slowdown that Mr. Levie hopes the new developer strategy may also turn around. As of its latest earnings report, in March, Box had $330 million in cash.  Mr. Levie and his company are nearing a make-or-break point others in this generation of young companies are also likely to soon face: Find a way to cut those losses and stay ahead of deep-pocketed competition or disappear. For Box to compete, it has to get other people to build great things on what it has built in the same way Apple and Google got app makers to create tools that made their mobile software indispensable. At a company conference this week, Box, which has so far focused on Internet data storage and collaboration technology, will explain how it plans to help other businesses build their own cloud services. The goal is to create a so-called ecosystem that ensures continued growth just as Microsoft did with PCs and Apple did with the iPhone. If the plan does not work, it is doubtful that Box will survive as an independent company, and Mr. Levie, for all those high hopes, will become a footnote, someone with a great idea who could not quite turn it into a lasting business.\\n\\n\\nAMD Q2 earnings: Stock Drops 10%, Most Since July After Outlook Misses Estimates: Advanced Micro Devices Inc. fell the most since July after the chipmaker’s revenue forecast fell short of analysts’ estimates. Second-quarter revenue will be between $968.2 million to $1.03 billion, the Sunnyvale, California-based company forecast Thursday in a statement after markets closed. Analysts had predicted $1.14 billion, according to 23 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. AMD shares slid 10 percent to close at $2.58 on Friday as the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.5 percent amid a broad decline for stocks. AMD is trying to break away from more than 40 years as a cheaper alternative to Intel Corp., the world’s largest chipmaker. Sales from custom chips that AMD sells for video-game consoles such as Sony Corp.’s PlayStation and Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox haven’t made up for falling demand for personal-computer processors.\\n\\n\\nChina fines Alibaba $129,000 for pricing violations: China\\'s e-commerce giant, Alibaba Group, has been fined 800,000 yuan ($129,000) by the price bureau in eastern Zhejiang province for violations by third-party sellers during promotions on its e-commerce platforms. Since Alibaba turned \"Singles\\' Day\", a November 11 Chinese response to Valentine\\'s Day, into an online shopping festival in 2009, the event has grown to similar proportions as Cyber Monday and Black Friday in the United States. Sales of more than $9 billion were achieved at last year\\'s event, and the company has copyrighted the phrase \"Double 11\", a reference to the date (11/11), which in turn, refers to the status of single people. \"The company has been fined 500,000 yuan ($81,000) for matters related to Singles\\' Day pricing by third-party sellers on our Tmall marketplace in 2013 and 2014 and 300,000 yuan($48,000) for pricing in other promotions in 2013 and 2015,\" Alibaba Group said in a statement on Friday. While pricing is handled by third parties, not directly by Alibaba, the group said, it would nevertheless reinforce pricing rules and regulations with sellers to protect consumers. The 27,000 vendors featured on Alibaba\\'s Singles\\' Day shopping sites hope to boost sales and gain customers, but some have complained that discounts and cut-throat corporate rivalry undercut the benefits. Alibaba has had occasional difficulties regulating its sprawling e-commerce empire, which now includes online markets such as Taobao; Tmall, a platform for larger retailers linked to Taobao; group-buying site Juhuasuan and the original flagship platform Alibaba.com, which links exporters with foreign buyers. Alibaba shares have lost more than a fifth this year, with analysts citing concern about counterfeits along with lackluster third-quarter earnings and waning investor excitement after last September\\'s record-setting $25-billion IPO.\\n\\n\\nOffline to Online: Indonesian conglomerate Lippo prepares for a drive into e-Commerce: Indonesian conglomerate Lippo Group has appointed Credit Suisse and Bank of America Merrill Lynch to lead its first round of funding, worth $200 million, for its e-commerce push. Lippo, controlled by the Riady family, has also chosen Rothschild as its financial adviser for the transaction. The funding will be used to \"dominate e-commerce in Indonesia,\" it said in a statement on Monday. Lippo plans to launch payment, chat and other online services early next year as it expands in the nascent e-commerce industry of the world\\'s fourth most populous country, director John Riady told Reuters last month. Lippo has already earmarked $500 million for a new online department store, and investment in services planned for the first quarter of 2016 will be on top of that, Riady said.\\n\\n\\nRakuten Ventures invests in push notification platform startup: Rakuten Ventures, the investment arm of the Japan-based ecommerce titan, announced today that it has made an undisclosed seed investment in a US startup that’s made a push notification platform aimed at mobile app and game developers. That startup is OneSignal, which today rebrands from GameThrive. “If the opportunity arises, Rakuten Ventures would love to see the [OneSignal] team partner up with Rakuten Group to utilize the company’s capabilities,” he adds. Viber, which Rakuten acquired in February 2014, has 236 million monthly active users at the last count, surpassing the much-hyped Line app. While most people are coming to hate spammy push notifications as much as banner ads, they’re still considered by many mobile app developers as a great tool for engagement – to give people a little nudge and some kind of enticement to get back into their app or game. The simple fact is that monetization is a lot harder if people don’t open your app all that often. “Push notifications are a key part of every single mobile application since they are easy to use, have low barriers for user opt-in, and have significantly higher visibility than email messages,” explains George Deglin, the CEO of OneSignal. “Most of our clients use our service to send occasional messages to their users to re-engage users by encouraging them to complete an action or to tell them about new features. We also have many clients using our service for transactional notifications, such as telling users when it’s their turn in a multiplayer game.” The team has recently been working on HTML5 push notification support in Google Chrome and Firefox. “With this, our developer audience will soon expand outside of mobile to include anyone with a website,” adds Deglin.\\n\\n\\nFacebook Seeks to Edge Out YouTube - Pushes Publishers for Exclusive, Optimized Content: Hosting exclusive programming appears to be Facebook\\'s latest move toward becoming a dominant player in streaming video. BuzzFeed and ABC\\'s Jimmy Kimmel Live also recently struck a deal with Facebook, while a number of other publishers say they have projects in the works. There is a strong push to provide exclusive content to Facebook, which the social network is \"aggressively\" asking for, say several publishers contacted by Adweek. One publisher who requested anonymity noted that while posting a YouTube link to his video on Facebook produced weak results, the same content posted directly to Facebook led to millions of views. Facebook, he said, had \"no desire\" to see YouTube\\'s preroll ads on its platform as it affected the user experience. \"Most companies know that a best practice on Facebook is that an image of a video performs better than a direct link [to a third-party player],\" noted Paul Kontonis, executive director of the Global Online Video Association. \"But Facebook native video performs better than everything.\" While Facebook has done a limited number of video ad deals, publishers have been told traditional ads are on the way. In the meantime, sources said the social network will announce the expansion of branded-content program Facebook Anthology at a meeting with publishers, brands and agencies in New York on April 22. Anthology connects advertisers with publishers to create Facebook-native content—Budweiser\\'s 2013 Made in America partnership with Vice, for example. Other Anthology participants include Vox, The Onion and Funny or Die. The finely tuned targeting capabilities around Facebook video are grabbing the attention of marketers. And no wonder. Facebook targeting by age, gender and location boasts up to 94 percent accuracy while its video player can derive deeper insights and metrics than other competitors, including YouTube, per Universal McCann. Still, said Kevin Cronin, partner, search and social at UM, YouTube remains the leading platform for driving views overall. He cautions that if Facebook is asking publishers for exclusive content, marketers creating branded content might balk at having to limit that content to a single platform. James Crolley, media director at Starcom MediaVest, noted that while Facebook has an autoplay feature, videos can easily be passed over in a feed. The challenge, he said, is \"it does require creative to be far more impactful.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nForcing Login Helps Facebook Solve the Global Cookie Shortage: The company tracks app users across devices to prove ads work. For advertisers, one of the Web’s advantages over TV is the ability to track which ads get clicks and lead to sales. However, most mobile apps block cookies, leaving marketers blind. This cookie crunch has become a full-blown crisis as shopping on smartphones and tablets has exploded. Last year, U.S. marketers bought about $19 billion worth of ads on phones and $32 billion on PCs, according to researcher EMarketer; this year, the company estimates, the total will be $29 billion on phones and $30 billion on PCs. Enter Facebook, which promises the more than 1 million businesses that advertise through its Atlas Solutions network that they can follow 1.4 billion users from PCs to smartphones to tablets and back. To use Facebook, you have to log in, and the social network records identifying information about each device you’ve logged in from. That data is stored in your profile, so Facebook knows it’s you online, even when you’re visiting other sites. Atlas is an ad network, like Google’s AdSense, that Facebook bought from Microsoft in 2013 and relaunched late last year. Its advantage lies in the depth of Facebook’s knowledge of its consumers. Even though advertisers don’t know the identity of specific users, the demographic information Facebook gives them, broken down by characteristics such as age and gender, can help them tailor ad campaigns for different audiences, says Jonathan Nelson, chief executive officer of Omnicom Digital, an early adopter of Atlas. “If you can connect the dots backwards, you can understand, ‘How did that happen?’\\u2009” Nelson says. “That’s a gold mine.” The Atlas network can also track Facebook users’ behavior on other websites, says Brad Smallwood, vice president for marketing science. Retailers can embed special Atlas code into their websites or apps that detect whether a customer buying a blouse she saw on her mobile browser viewed a related ad on Facebook. Atlas is an important test for Facebook, which gets more than 90 percent of its revenue from ads, as it tries to boost its appeal to mobile advertisers and compete with Google. The search giant commanded 37 percent of U.S. mobile ad revenue in 2014, more than double Facebook’s share, and has also begun tracking people across devices by using login data. Facebook’s ads, however, are more tailored to individual users based on what it knows about them. \\n\\n\\nEtsy Closes Up 86 Percent On First Day Of Trading: Etsy, the online marketplace for handmade goods, went public today. Shares opened at $31 on the NASDAQ, popping up 94 percent from the initial set price of $16 per share. The company closed its first day of trading at $30 per share, an 86% percent rise from its initial price. The company raised over $287 million by selling 16.7 million shares before trading, valuing the company at nearly $1.8 billion. Stock went up close to $35 by mid morning. Etsy is now worth more than $3.5 billion. The handmade crafts company is not yet turning a profit, but has seen year-over-year growth in revenue for the past few years, rocketing from $74.6 million in 2012, to $125 million in 2013 and to $195.59 million last year. It had 1.4 million active sellers and 19.8 million active buyers as of December. The success of the company’s IPO bodes well for the technology liquidity market, as it could spur other firms waiting on the sidelines to pull the trigger on their own IPOs. The technology IPO market has been slow so far in 2015. Box listed its shares earlier this year, receiving a massive 70 percent day one pop. Box’s shares, however, have since receded. The success of Etsy’s IPO could shine especially bright for Shopify, another company that recently filed for its own initial offering. They are related, if not analogous companies; Shopify provides e-commerce tools to small and medium-sized business, a moderate contrast to Etsy’s own solution. Still, the companies both track the aggregate dollar flow through their respective platforms. Etsy saw gross merchandise sales (GMS) in 2014 of $1.93 billion, while Shopify saw gross merchandise volume (GMV) of $3.76 billion in the same period. Etsy derives, as you expect, more revenue per dollar-through-platform given its intimate status as the marketplace network itself, in contrast to Shopify’s SaaS solution that helps others build their own sales channels. Given the enthusiastic reception of Etsy by investors, Shopify might anticipate a similiary warm reaction given the shared overtones of the two companies. The latter company has yet to price.\\n\\n\\nEuropean Regulators Are Stifling the Ad Business for Google, Facebook and Others: Regulators, consumers fight some of their best tactics: This week, Google was the latest, and perhaps the hardest hit, by the scrutiny overseas, as the European Union charged it with anti-trust practices by favoring its own Web properties in search results over rivals. Often, Google serves up results for shopping items to the detriment of e-commerce competitors, and it delivers instant reviews, keeping traffic away from rivals like Yelp. The ultimate penalty could force Google to change its search tactics, but the probe could also veer into other aspects of its business that impact advertising. Here in the U.S., regulators declined to label Google a search monopoly when they fully investigated the company in 2013, but they still closely watch how it competes with rivals and deals with consumers. The Mountainview, Calif.-company is not alone in these tense situations with European leaders. Facebook has been hit over user privacy, especially in Germany. The continent also is going after tech companies over taxes and security issues. The less the companies are able to operate freely, the less data they can accumulate, and the less finely tuned—and less valuable—their ads are, according to marketing experts. This week, industry research group eMarketer, which tracks global marketing spending, found social ad revenue is growing more slowly in western Europe than in North America or Asia. Meanwhile central and eastern Europe lagged further behind, and the disparity in overall digital growth was even greater. A number of factors drive digital ad dollars, but one is the ease with which tech companies can collect data on users, target ads and charge for such messages. European attitudes could hinder one of the most effective types of digital advertising, retargeting. \"One of the main attractions to social media from advertisers (particularly to Facebook and Twitter, who own 75 percent of spending in this market) is the ability to use data to target customized audiences,\" said Dan Marcec, public relations director at eMarketer, in an email. \"So any restriction on that would have an effect.\" Google wants to give brands new retargeting tools for search ads, according to reports this week. A source confirmed the company is interested in using advertisers\\' e-mail lists to do so. When reached for comment, Google said it always considers new products, but had nothing to share at this time. Another digital advertising source said Google\\'s interest in retargeting could attract more regulatory spotlights. Fair or not, while Twitter and Facebook build fully integrated data machines for targeted ads across the Web, Google sometimes gets closer review in the U.S. and Europe. \"It\\'s clear Google is starting to think about using search to inform more advertising, and it runs a risk with regulators,\" the ad executive said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Some of Google\\'s top rivals, including Microsoft, are said to be leading the charge in tipping off regulators about practices they see as unfair—practices that touch on all corners of its business, like search, data, privacy and advertising.\\n\\n\\nChina Halts New Policy on Tech for Banks:\\xa0China has suspended a policy that would have effectively pushed foreign technology companies out of the country’s banking sector, according to a note sent by Chinese regulators to banks. Dated Monday, the letter called for banks to “suspend implementation” of the rules, which have been at the center of a brewing trade conflict between the United States and China. The rules, put into effect at the end of last year, called for companies that sell computer equipment to Chinese banks to turn over intellectual property and submit source code, in addition to other demands. At stake is billions of dollars of business for major American companies that make the advanced computing hardware and software that crunches numbers for banks across China. Trade groups representing companies including Microsoft, IBM and Apple have complained that such policies are protectionist. Yet the development is only a small reprieve for American tech companies. The suspension is temporary as authorities revise the rules. It is unclear how regulators will change the rules, but industry officials say a new version — even if it avoids more contentious issues like forcing the disclosure of source code — will still be problematic to multinational tech companies. China’s vice minister of finance, Zhu Guangyao, informed Nathan Sheets, the Treasury’s under secretary, of the decision to suspend the rules during a meeting in Washington, a senior administration official said. The recent trade debate is part of a wider clash between China and the United States over online security and technology policy. Such backpedaling is rare for Chinese policy makers, yet there is a precedent. In 2009, China said all computers imported to the country must come with filtering software called Green Dam-Youth Escort preinstalled. After heavy international pressure, China suspended the rule indefinitely.\\n\\n\\nWith Eye on Mobile, Yahoo Revises Its Search Partnership With Microsoft: Yahoo and Microsoft announced on Thursday that they had amended their 10-year search partnership to allow Yahoo to deliver its own search results and ads for up to half the searches made by visitors to Yahoo sites and apps. Under the original agreement, struck five years ago, Yahoo was required to use Microsoft’s Bing search results and ads for all desktop searches, although it was free to use alternatives on mobile devices. Yahoo’s one billion users will not see a new search experience immediately, and any changes will probably be gradual. The venerable Internet company, which dominated web search before the rise of Google, sold its search technology to Microsoft under the original agreement and has only a small team devoted to search now. But Ms. Mayer, who oversaw the interface and other major elements of the search experience at Google, has made it clear that she wants Yahoo to innovate on search, and the company has been experimenting with new approaches on mobile devices, particularly in personalizing results and presenting ads. Search is vital to Yahoo’s business, accounting for 35 percent of the company’s revenue last year, or $1.8 billion. Under the original agreement, Microsoft gives Yahoo about 90 percent of the revenue from ads it shows on Yahoo. The companies said that under the revised deal, “this existing underlying economic structure remains unchanged.” Desktop users in the United States conducted 12.7 percent of their searches on Yahoo and 20.1 percent on Bing in March, according to comScore, a research firm. Google dominated the market with 64.4 percent of searches. Ms. Mayer and Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, were both personally involved in the negotiations. Microsoft has poured billions of dollars into search, and Mr. Nadella is committed to remaining in the business. Microsoft was a primary agitator behind the European Commission’s decision on Wednesday to bring antitrust charges against Google, accusing the company of abusing its dominance in search to hurt consumers and competitors. Yahoo will now be able to sell desktop search ads to advertisers through its Gemini platform, which the company is building into a one-stop shop for buying ads across all Yahoo properties as well as other apps and sites in its network. Microsoft will gradually take over sales of all ads for Bing search, allowing it to integrate the team more closely with the people developing search technology. Previously, the premium ads were sold by Yahoo sales representatives.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBoomerang Commerce Launches A/B Testing Platform For Pricing: Boomerang Commerce, a startup that helps online retailers optimize their pricing and a 2014 Disrupt NY Startup Battlefield finalist, today announced the launch of its A/B testing service for pricing. Marketers love A/B testing to see which message works best, but when it comes to pricing, offering two different customers two different prices for the same product can quickly become a recipe for disaster. You’re bound to upset some customers, after all, when they find out they paid more for a product than somebody else. Boomerang CEO Guru Hariharan acknowledges as much. “You can’t just use standard tools,” he said. “If you do that, you’ll lose trust. More often than not, it’s a bad idea.” So what Boomerang does is allow retailers to test different pricing strategies and algorithms across a small group of products, for example, to test which ones maximize the retailers revenues and profits. The idea here then is less about charging customer A one price and customer B another, but to see which pricing strategies work better. Say you have 100,000 products in your inventory (the company only works with very large retailers that do $25 million or more in online sales). Boomerang now lets them take a representative set of 500 of these and test different pricing strategies on them. “Merchandizers and analysts at click and mortar retailers have had to wait months to draw conclusive results from price tests,” Hariharan said. “In the digital world, you don’t have that kind of luxury with time and need to make decisions as quickly as possible – often with limited data. This is why we believe that facilitating rapid testing of pricing strategies would help them figure out a way to set the right prices for their products in a timely manner.” Besides A/B testing, Boomerang also launched a number of other new products over the last couple of months, including a price optimizer that helps retailers manage a product’s pricing lifecycle from introductory pricing all the way to clearance markdowns. The company also recently launched an improve competitive pricing intelligence service that helps retailers stay on top of what their competitors are charging. The company has grown from 15 employees a year ago to 70 employees now. Hariharan tells me Boomerang’s software now manages about $2 billion in sales every year.\\n\\n\\nSix percent of U.S. adults plan to buy Apple Watch - that would out-pace Wall Street estimates - according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll: About 6 percent of U.S. adults plan to buy Apple Inc\\'s smartwatch according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, with men twice as likely as women to purchase Apple boss Tim Cook\\'s first new major product. If calculated based on 2014 U.S. Census projections, and excluding younger teens, this could mean potential sales of about 15 million watches, if those who said they intended to buy follow through with an actual purchase. Wall Street estimates had varied widely between 10 million and 32 million worldwide sales in 2015. Van Baker, an analyst at tech research firm Gartner, said the Reuters poll results indicated a \"pretty high percentage\" was interested in buying. \"It should serve Apple well if they can even get close to that,\" he said. The poll showed the watch, marketed by Apple as a high-fashion item as well as a new frontier in technology, appealed to fewer than 4 percent of women compared with 9 percent of men Samsung Electronics, Sony Corp and LG Electronics have all released their own smartwatches, many of them powered by software developed by Internet company Google Inc. None have given sales figures but independent researcher Smartwatch Group estimates that 6.8 million smartwatches were sold worldwide last year, led by Samsung with about 1.2 million units. The Apple Watch, priced from $349 for a basic Sport model to a $17,000 gold timepiece, lets users check email, listen to music and make phone calls when paired with an iPhone. Reviews have generally praised its style but criticized battery life and slow-loading apps. According to the poll, adults aged between 30 and 39 were the most likely buyers, with 13 percent saying they planed to buy an Apple Watch, followed by 10 percent of 18-to-29-year-olds. Just under a third of respondents said they already own an iPhone. Not surprisingly, iPhone owners are more likely to spend money on the new Apple gadget, with about 15 percent saying they planed to buy.\\n\\n\\nThe EU formally accused Google of abusing its dominance: The European Union’s antitrust chief on Wednesday formally accused Google of abusing its dominance in web searches, bringing charges that could limit the giant American tech company’s moneymaking prowess. How Google responds in the case — the biggest since the case against Microsoft in the 2000s — and to what degree the accusations hamper its own business or aid its rivals remain to be seen. Google holds a roughly 90 percent share in the region’s search market, and the company contends that in both web searches and Android software it plays fair. If Google fails to rebut the formal charges, Ms. Vestager could levy a fine that could exceed €6 billion — about 10 percent of Google’s most recent annual revenue. But the largest single fine yet levied in such a case falls well short of that mark: The record is €1.1 billion in 2009 against Intel for abusing its dominance of the computer chip market. The Google case is the most weighty decision by Ms. Vestager since she took office late last year. But the decision to open a separate investigation, into whether Google’s use of its Android operating system, might turn out to be as significant. Regulators will look into whether Google abused its dominant position by pre-installing its apps and services onto Android smartphones that potentially gave Google preferential treatment compared with its rivals. The investigation could take years. More here: The European Union accused Google Inc on Wednesday of cheating consumers and competitors by distorting Web search results to favor its own shopping service, after a five-year investigation that could change the rules for business online. It also started another antitrust investigation into the Android mobile operating system, a key element in Google\\'s strategy to maintain revenues from online advertising as people switch from Web browser searches to smartphone apps. Europe is very important to Google: The European market contributes about 35 percent of Google’s revenue, according to Carlos Kirjner, a New York-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Its market share in search exceeds 90 percent in most European markets, compared with about 65 percent in the U.S. Google dropped as much as 1.4 percent to $523.22 in New York trading. The shares fell 1 percent to $525.30 at 10:25 a.m. local time.\\n\\n\\nNetflix Q1 earnings: Revenue +24% at $1.57B, shares soar 12% as subscriber count stands at 62M:  Netflix Inc. said its video-streaming service topped 62 million subscribers worldwide, as original shows such as “House of Cards” drew new viewers globally. The shares soared to a record high. U.S. subscribers jumped by 2.28 million in the first quarter, while international accounts rose 2.6 million, the Los Gatos, California-based company said Wednesday on its website. Both figures beat the company’s Jan. 20 forecast. Sales grew 24 percent to $1.57 billion, matching analysts’ projections. Netflix is investing heavily in original programming to keep the U.S. business growing and support Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings’s international expansion. While new shows such as “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” and “Bloodline” drove U.S. viewing, the rise of the U.S. dollar trimmed sales and contributed to losses overseas, the company said. “Netflix remains a subscriber growth momentum story,” Paul Sweeney, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in an e-mail. “As long as domestic and international subscribers continue to grow, bulls will have a reason to buy the stock.” Netflix rose 12 percent to $534.07 in extended trading after results were announced. If that holds Thursday, it will mark an all-time high, with the market value of the company exceeding that of CBS Corp. The stock fell 0.7 percent to $475.46 at the close Wednesday in New York. So far this year, Netflix has advanced 39 percent, fourth-most among members of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. First-quarter net income fell to $24 million, or 38 cents a share, from $53.1 million, or 86 cents, as the strong dollar contributed to losses outside the U.S. Excluding that, profit was 77 cents, the company said. Analysts forecast profit of 63 cents, the average of 35 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Original programming is taking larger slice of Netflix’s content budget. The company’s obligations, which grew 30 percent last year, now total $9.8 billion. The growth in subscribers justifies the increasing costs, according to Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research. Netflix extended its service to Australia and New Zealand in March. It rolls out its streaming service in Japan later this year, its first market in Asia. The company plans to offer its service worldwide by the end of 2016, though it is unclear if that will include China. A report this week by UBS AG projected Netflix would reach 87 million subscribers outside the U.S. by 2020. That total now stands at 20.9 million. In total, Netflix forecasts 2.5 million new subscribers this quarter, including 600,000 in the U.S. and 1.9 million overseas.\\n\\n\\nHyperlocal grocery delivery startups are hot in India:\\xa0Grofers raises $35M in Series B round, and PepperTap bags $10M two days after ZopNow’s $10M round: Hyper-local grocery and fresh food delivery platform Grofers, has raised $35 million (Rs 218 crore) from its existing investors Tiger Global Management and Sequoia Capital, the company said on Wednesday. Its second round of funding comes just two months after it closed a Series A fundraise worth $10 million from Tiger Global and Sequoia. The startup had previously raised seed funding from Sequoia and Deepinder Goyal, co-founder and CEO of Zomato. Separate media reports, citing sources, pegged Grofer’s valuation in the new funding round in the $110-115 million range. The company said it will use the funds to add products in addition to expanding services to more cities. Founded by Saurabh Kumar and Albinder Dhindsa, Grofers allows users to order products ranging from grocery to pet supplies and baby care products online and enables delivery within 90 minutes. It allows consumers order products available at brick and mortar stores through the Grofers mobile app. The smartphone-based grocery delivery platform currently partners with more than 400 merchants in Bangalore, Delhi-NCR and Mumbai. It expects to start delivering products in Hyderabad and Pune by next month. Grofers claims to have witnessed a sharp increase in the number of orders and expects to execute over 20,000 orders this month.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntel Q1 earnings: revenue flat at $12.8B, earnings up 3% at $2B; Shares up 3% on strong sales of chips for data centers, internet-of-things; capex cut:\\xa0Intel reported that net income rose 3 percent to $2 billion, compared with the year-ago quarter. Intel’s per-share income rose 8 percent, to 41 cents a share, reflecting a smaller number of shares outstanding because of stock buybacks. Revenue was flat, at $12.8 billion. The earnings were about even with Wall Street’s expectations. Analysts forecast that Intel would make 41 cents a share on revenue of $12.9 billion, a survey by Thomson Reuters said. Intel shares increased 3 percent in after-hours trading. The earnings were not surprising, given slow PC sales. Last week, the research firm IDC said that worldwide first-quarter PC shipments were 68.5 million, a decline of 6.7 percent from the year-earlier period. That was slightly better than expected. Chips for PCs and related items make up over half of Intel’s revenue. Intel was slow to move into mobile devices and is overshadowed there by companies like Qualcomm and ARM. Under Mr. Krzanich, who took over two years ago, Intel has redoubled its efforts to get into mobile devices. Progress has been slow, however, with significant financial losses. Other areas of Intel’s business have fared better. Sales of chips for data centers were up 19 percent in the quarter. Intel expects that market to grow about 15 percent annually for several more years. A newer market, chips for the so-called Internet of Things, or appliances and other objects with a two-way network connection, grew 11 percent. That revenue was only $533 million, but Stacy Smith, Intel’s chief financial officer, said annual growth in this area should be about 20 percent for many years. More on margins, mobile, Altera: Strength in the server unit is keeping profit margins healthy. Gross margin, or the percentage of sales left after deducting production costs, will be about 62 percent in the current period, Intel said. Analysts were predicting 61 percent. Last year, Intel’s mobile business racked up operating losses of more than $4 billion as it paid subsidies to customers to build market share in tablet chips. This year, Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich has promised to reduce that loss by about $800 million. Smith said the company is on track to meet that goal. As it struggles to boost its mobile business, Intel is seeking to make a bigger bet on the data-center market. The company held discussions to acquire chipmaker Altera Corp., according to people familiar with the talks. Buying Altera would bring in chips that are increasingly being used in data centers and help Intel put its factory network to greater use. Intel made a $54-a-share bid for Altera, which the programmable chipmaker’s board has rejected, breaking off talks, people familiar with the negotiations said last week. Altera is now coming under pressure from its shareholders to reconsider Intel’s offer, because they think it values Altera at more than what it can achieve itself, people with knowledge of the matter said. CapEx cut to improve cash flow: Intel said it would cut 2015 capital expenditures to $8.7 billion from $10 billion, a reduction that analysts said should improve free cash flow.\\n\\n\\nIBM makes a big healthcare analytics play, ties up with Apple, J&J and Medtronic: IBM is taking its Watson artificial-intelligence technology into health care in a big way with industry partners, a pair of acquisitions and an ambitious agenda. The initial three industry partners are Apple, Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic. On Monday afternoon, after the close of stock trading, IBM also announced it would buy two start-ups: Explorys, a spin-off from the Cleveland Clinic whose data on 50 million patients is used to spot patterns in diseases, treatments and outcomes; and Phytel, a Dallas maker of software to manage patient care and reduce readmission rates to hospitals. The IBM plan, put simply, is that its Watson technology will be a cloud-based service that taps vast stores of health data and delivers tailored insights to hospitals, physicians, insurers, researchers and potentially even individual patients. “We’re going to enable personalized health care on a huge scale,” said John E. Kelly, a senior vice president who oversees IBM’s research labs and new initiatives. To date, IBM has done some individual projects using Watson technology with leading medical centers, including Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and the Cleveland Clinic. But the creation of the Watson Health unit, Mr. Kelly said, is an effort to apply the technology to the mainstream of health care. And while IBM has been commercializing Watson technology with tools for mining Twitter, weather and Internet of Things data, Mr. Kelly said Watson Health was the first move into a specific industry. The Watson Health announcement is also the latest in flurry of initiatives IBM has announced this year that include new corporate partnerships as well as moves in cloud computing, data analytics and Watson. They are evidence that IBM is intent on investing for future growth, and showing it is doing so, in a year when its financial performance is likely to lag. IBM has reported disappointing earnings recently, and Virginia M. Rometty, IBM’s chief executive, has told industry analysts and investors that 2015 would be a transition year in which new growth businesses like Watson did not yet overcome the profit erosion in some of its traditional hardware and software products.\\n\\n\\nZomato buys cloud-based PoS system; to help restaurants manage inventory, payments: Zomato.com, has acquired MapleGraph Solutions Pvt Ltd, which operated a point-of-sales business, for an undisclosed amount in what is its first acquisition outside its core business of restaurant listings and reviews, it said on Tuesday. Zomato is now launching its own version of the product under Zomato Base which would allow restaurants manage inventory and payments as well as provide real time analytics and more. The move would expand the revenue streams for Zomato, which currently draws bulk of its business from ads from restaurants. The firm has been looking at new ways to generate revenues and is starting an online food ordering and table reservation service. Zomato Base offers inventory and recipe management, analyses sales data to track restaurant’s performance, generates electronic receipts, as well as does payment gateway integration and menu management. Delhi-based MapleGraph was founded in 2011 by Arun Tangri (earlier worked with Microsoft and IBM India), Varun Tangri, (also co-founded Tokkri.com and DealerConnect.in) and Abhishek Rohilla (previously worked with Unisys and Siemens Information Systems). “Technology has seen very little penetration in the restaurant industry, and we are excited to be driving this change at large scale,” said Arun Tangri, co-founder and CEO, MapleGraph. “There is a lot that can be done if we are able to build a technology platform that connects consumers to restaurants and vice versa, and we believe that a world-class cloud-based POS system is the first step towards building that platform,” said Deepinder Goyal, co-founder and CEO, Zomato. Zomato will work on integrating the POS product’s services with the consumer product over the next few months. After the integration, Zomato will start offering Zomato Base to restaurant businesses across the world this fall.\\n\\n\\nOpera launches new version of its Opera Mini browser with enhanced data compression; targets 350 million mobile browser users in 2017: Norway\\'s Opera Software on Tuesday launched a new version of the Opera Mini browser for Android phones, hoping to more than double its smartphone user base by the end of 2017. Google\\'s Android is the most widely used operating system among mobile phone makers. With the launch of Mini 8, Opera aims to lift its smartphone user base to 275 million by 2017 from the current 130 million, increasing the total to 350 million when including around 75 million users of less advanced feature phones. The purpose of using Mini, which has become particularly popular in many developing countries, is both to speed up online surfing and to cut costs, as the browser can compress data by up to 90 percent. Smartphone customers generally do much more online surfing, making them far more valuable than users of feature phones although Opera Software doesn\\'t give revenue figures per user. \"It\\'s complicated, we have customers in 200 countries and more and more of them are using smartphones and fewer are on feature phones,\" Opera investor relations chief Petter Lade told Reuters. \"Our target is to have 275 million smart phones and 75 million on feature phones, this will be our total target for mobile users for 2017,\" he added.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",
      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\n\\nWith click-to-shop ads, Instagram Takes Another Step Toward E-Commerce...: Instagram is running its first marketing campaigns that transform viewers into shoppers with a single click. Finally, retailers can link to product pages from their Instagram ads—a feature Banana Republic was among the first to employ—and still more sophisticated ads are in the works. The new ads are part of a carefully managed rollout of better marketing tools on the Facebook-owned photo-sharing app, which is starting to offer the sort of products brands have been demanding, especially in view of the $200,000 many of them are shelling out. And that\\'s just the entry fee for buying ads on the platform, according to digital marketing executives familiar with Instagram\\'s business. (Instagram declined to comment for this story.) \"Instagram continues to tease big things coming,\" said one Hollywood marketing executive who buys ads on the platform. \"And they\\'re talking about more ways to integrate buying.\" Another ad executive revealed that, instead of a \"Buy\" button, Instagram would allow marketers to more easily link to checkout pages online. Yet even that step is a complicated undertaking, given that the app is largely a mobile experience. Sources reveal that more tools like this are on the horizon. Instagram is said to be considering a number of ad formats that could prove game changers for brands, similar to how Twitter built highly customizable ad cards that send users to products with ease. But because these changes would signal a fundamental change to how marketers use and customers experience the platform, Instagram is proceeding with caution, no doubt wary of displeasing its growing user base (now upwards of 300 million). Instagram introduced its first ads in late 2013 and since then has tried to maintain an image as a place for glossy campaigns as opposed to direct-response, click-driven efforts. The high price to advertise there is a reflection of the platform\\'s self-fashioned air of exclusivity. \"We\\'re paying a premium on Instagram ads,\" the Hollywood executive said. Video ads are especially pricey, going for as much as $30 per 1,000 views, according to sources. Instagram is even attempting to get brands to rethink what success looks like by providing campaign data, aiming to prove that impressions boost sales more than garden-variety clicks.\\n\\n\\n..even as Instagram and Facebook are more entwined than ever, for advertisers, who now have a potentially powerful new marketing strategy—using video ads on one to drive sales on the other. Stuart Weitzman, the fashion brand, is one of the first marketers to buy video ads on Instagram, and then send product posts on Facebook to a custom audience of people who viewed the ad. It\\'s an aggressive tactic that incorporates some of the most advanced new ad products from the two social media platforms. Stuart Weitzman also is using cinemagraphs—a mix of still imagery and video that Facebook is encouraging marketers to embrace—for the creative. \"The campaign is about how to find that perfect mix of brand and direct response marketing,\" said Susan Duffy, CMO of Stuart Weitzman. \"One of the exciting things we\\'re doing is using the full marketing funnel.\" Stuart Weitzman is going after 22- to 40-year-old women, and it\\'s using sequential messaging to influence their buying decisions. One week, the women see the cinemagraphs on Instagram, and the next, they get a product ad on Facebook, thanks to custom targeting tools integrating the two platforms. Facebook has no official stats on how many of its users also are on Instagram, but with more than 1.3 billion people on Facebook and more than 300 million Instagram users, there is plenty of room for overlap.\\n\\n\\nAs PEs increase Tech Funding, Founders find that Big Valuations Come With Dangerous Small Print: About three years ago we started noticing a sliver of founders who were obsessively focused on valuations start to make short-term decisions in their fundraising that risked meaningful long-term consequences. With the popularity of the “unicorn” label, this trend has gotten worse. A few months ago a Midas List friend shared a story of dismay with an example in their portfolio that typifies the situation. Their founder had two term sheets to choose from. One was a “clean” term sheet with no preferences beyond the norm and a barely sub-billion-dollar valuation. The other granted the magical, in the founders’ but not investors’ minds, $1 billion valuation in exchange for a set of onerous preferences. The founder chose the latter. The investor’s fear, which we share, is that the excessive focus on valuation, regardless of terms, can be significantly damaging over time — not just to the founder, but to his team and all the prior shareholders, including seed and venture investors. Part of this is due to the changing nature of funders; many mega-valuation, pref-heavy term sheets come from private equity (PE) shops like hedge and mutual funds accustomed to standardizing on downside protection and guaranteed returns, a very different game than venture.  PE shops are making even better returns than the already phenomenal ones we detailed through the issuance of additional shares, guaranteed return levels and other downside protections that protective prefs provide. And in the zero-sum game of return, additional return to one party comes out of the return, or through the dilution, of another; specifically founders, employees and prior investors alike. Let’s look at an example: Several years ago an entrepreneur raising money in a particularly heated round asked, “How do I get a billion?” He was entirely focused on hitting $1 billion in valuation above all else. He didn’t get to his billion target in that round, though he got close, but he did in a later round, at a significant cost. The cost was paid when the company went public. The cost of the valuation was a guaranteed return on the investment made: at least 2x on IPO. Beyond being onerous, as the IPO proved, it set a precedent and pattern. A later investor got a guarantee of 1.5x and the one thereafter a more traditional 1x; although a 1x guarantee on IPO is very different from a traditional 1x liquidation preference, which only kicks in on the sale of the company or a similar event. When the company IPOed it did so below the $1 billion valuation, and the preferences kicked in. In order to make good on the guarantees the company had to issue additional post- IPO stock, which diluted all the non-pref-enriched shareholders by almost 15 percent. The company’s shares also traded down significantly on opening day, chalking up an unwanted record; the biggest first day dip in IPO price of any U.S. company that year. More recently, when Box priced its IPO at $14 a share, below its last private round at $20, it triggered the preferences to their last private investors, Coatue and TPG, including “profit protection.” According to Box’s S-1, every share of Series F stock converted into shares of common stock equal to $20 divided by the lesser of 90 percent of the price per share of common stock, or $20, meaning Series F investors were guaranteed at least a 10 percent discount to the IPO price. If not the balance was made up in additional stock grants. So if Box priced at $22.22 or above, the Series F shareholders wouldn’t receive any additional shares from their preference for the shares they paid $20 thereby locking in a 10 percent profit plus all upside above $22.22. But Box priced at $14, triggering the preference and ever Series F share converted into 1.587 shares of public common, versus the one-to-one conversion they would have achieved at a $22.22 price, and further diluted the shareholder base. Box’s most recent 10K reports a share count of 119.8 million, but if the series F had not converted the number would have been 115.4 million, meaning the company issued an additional 4.4 million shares as a make good on top of the original 7.5 million shares originally converted. Without a conversion preference, the Series F holders would have converted to 6.5 percent of the shares, with the preference that increased, post IPO, to 10 percent (54  percent accretion for Series F PE shareholders) and lowered the remaining shareholders ownership from 93.5 percent to 90 percent. To make this that much more frustrating to the founders and investors before the final investor, Box’s shares actually traded as high as $24.73 on opening day, well above the $22.22 protection price, but since ratchets are triggered by IPO pricing the last private round investors received their additional shares regardless. Prior private preferred rounds (PPR) are not uncommon in IPOs, but they do appear to be more common in TMT (Technology Media & Telecommunications) IPOs, and are even more pronounced in TMT IPO down rounds.\\n\\n\\nWritten-off and forgotten, but still going: Groupon Market Value Seen as High as $6 Billion With Divestments: Groupon Inc. could divest four businesses in the next two years, netting as much as $730 million, to raise cash as it expands into an e-commerce marketplace, according to Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos. Groupon has a market value of about $5 billion, though it should be closer to $6 billion because those businesses are undervalued, Munster said. A majority stake in its Ticket Monster business, which offers daily deals and e-commerce services in South Korea, could fetch about $500 million, while smaller units might yield between $30 million and $100 million each, he said. With a stock that trades at little more than a third of its 2011 initial public offering price, Groupon has shifted its focus from e-mailed daily deals to competing with Amazon.com Inc. and EBay Inc. as a marketplace. To do so, it will need to sell some non-core properties to free up more cash to invest in the initiative, some analysts said. As of the end of December, the Chicago-based company had about $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. “What is safe to say is that Groupon has several stealth assets that are generally underappreciated by investors as far as overall value,” said Munster, who is based in Minneapolis. Private equity firms are the most likely buyers, he said. Groupon shares have climbed 28 percent in the past six months to $7.39 in New York. Still they are 63 percent below the IPO price of $20 set in November 2011. Proceeds from the sales could help Groupon make acquisitions to expand its e-commerce operations, including online retailers or a payments business, Sweeney said. Another option -- buying a service that delivers food or goods to customers, Tom Taulli, the author of The Complete M&A Handbook, said in an interview. Or it could put the money into new fulfillment centers, Sweeney said. Groupon is testing Groupon Stores, where businesses can post their offerings. It’s also testing movie downloads from its site.\\n\\n\\nTencent market value breaks US$200 billion: China’s Tencent broke new ground on Monday when its stock (00700.HK) closed at HK$170.50, bringing the company’s total market value above US$200 billion for the first time ever. Tencent has been one of China’s biggest internet companies since the very beginning with its QQ messaging service. These days, the company has its hands in almost every corner of the internet industry. It remains the top player in China’s social media and messaging sector, and it also dominates a number of other sectors including online and mobile gaming.\\n\\n\\nUrban Ladder aims for $100M in GMV, outlines tech-product plans: The firm has just raised $50 million in a fresh round of funding from both new and existing investors. The main focus is to expand our products and services to more cities, which we have been doing for the last six-seven months. The next focus is technology—we are focusing on innovations in customer experience, mobility, automation and analytics. We are trying to offer a new customer experience, helping customers get a sense of our products. We believe a lot of innovation needs to happen in this space. Mobility is getting a big push. Customers are doing a lot of discovery, exploration and transactions via mobile. Once we have the right products, services and technology in place, we would want to enable a marriage of these aspects to bring out greater results. Our aim is to invite the customer to give us the key to his/her house so that we can design and furnish an extremely beautiful house and give the key back to the customer in just three weeks through a tech-enabled process. A lot of innovation needs to happen on the customer experience and the web (store) part. We are investing a lot on mobile technologies to provide a great experience on the core catalogue as well as on areas like visualisation, personalisation and app development. A bunch of innovations will come out on how customers interact with products on mobile and how customers engage with the brand on mobile. We are building a strong technology, user experience and product management team to look into these aspects. We are also looking at technologies such as ERP, GPS and RFID to automate and ensure smooth flow of information throughout the process without any manual involvement. Analytics is another key area of focus in terms of real-time data and dashboards. We now have a scale of data with which we will be able to gain a lot of inputs on buying patterns and personalisation can be done much more effectively with real-time analytics.\\n\\n\\nMarissa Mayer Shuffles Yahoo Leadership Team; Tumblr Struggles Lead to Founder\\'s Demotion: Marissa Mayer, Yahoo’s chief executive, announced a major reorganization of the company’s product teams on Friday, promoting the head of one recently acquired company and effectively demoting the chief of another. Under the new structure, Simon Khalaf, the Internet company’s data-spouting prophet of mobile, will become a senior vice president and oversee many of the company’s consumer-facing products, including the Yahoo home page, its portals devoted to themes like sports and movies, and related Yahoo apps. Mr. Khalaf joined Yahoo in July when it bought his mobile analytics company, Flurry, for about $300 million. Flurry, which offers data and advertising services to mobile app developers, has since become the core of Yahoo’s efforts to compete with Google, Facebook and Twitter to persuade developers to use its tools. Mr. Khalaf, a rapid-fire speaker with a knack for presenting complex information simply and clearly, has become a crucial Yahoo ambassador to the outside world and played a starring role at Yahoo’s recent mobile developer conference. As part of the reorganization, the blogging platform Tumblr and its chief executive, David Karp, will report to Mr. Khalaf, according to an internal announcement made at Yahoo Friday morning. Although Mr. Karp will remain part of the executive team, he will no longer report directly to Ms. Mayer, which he has done since he sold Tumblr to Yahoo for $1.1 billion in 2013. The move reflects Tumblr’s struggles to broaden its appeal beyond its core audience of of artists, teenagers and 20somethings looking for a platform to express themselves. Tumblr has served as the technology behind Yahoo’s digital magazines, but it has faced challenges in luring advertising. Tumblr’s top ad executive, Lee Brown, recently left the company and joined BuzzFeed after Yahoo integrated Tumblr’s ad sales with Yahoo’s. Mike Kerns, the senior vice president who previously oversaw Yahoo’s home page and verticals, is leaving the company to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Watch Sold Out Despite Scarce In-Store Crowds: (More here) Few people lined up at Apple Inc. stores from Beijing to New York to get a peek of the company’s new smartwatch, while online pre-orders pushed delivery dates for some versions into July. The Apple Watch, a test of Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook’s ability to innovate, arrived Friday in stores in eight countries and Hong Kong for customers to preview. It officially goes on sale April 24, when delivery begins of devices that have been ordered. Delivery times quickly pushed passed that date, after Apple began taking online pre-orders about 3 a.m. in New York. By about 9 a.m. shipments of high-end versions, which can cost as much as $17,000, were delayed until June. All 10 versions of the entry-level Sport, which starts at $349, were delayed until June, according to the company’s U.S. website. Mid-tier models were being promised for delivery in four to six weeks, with four versions stretching into June or July. “We view this as an indication of solid demand paired with very limited supply, with supply being the most significant limiting factor,” Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos., said Friday in a note to investors.\\n\\n\\nAmazon, Google aim to be Home Services Marketplaces: Some of the biggest names in e-commerce, along with a growing pool of start-ups, are vying for a chunk of the fragmented, quotidian, heretofore entirely local market of electricians, plumbers, dog walkers and other manual labor, known broadly as home services. The work may be mundane but the money and stakes are huge. Angie’s List, the 20-year-old subscription service that offers reviews of local service providers to members, estimates the home services industry is $400 billion. Others put it at more than $800 billion. “There are few pots of gold left as big as this on the Internet,” said Marco Zappacosta, chief executive and a co-founder of Thumbtack, a start-up that connects consumers with providers of a multitude of services, who then bid for their business. The idea is to bring the efficiency and capabilities of the web to some of the lowest-tech and least-transparent enterprises by connecting consumers with vetted service providers through online marketplaces. Most companies will then take a cut of each transaction that ensues. Last summer, Thumbtack received a big lift with a $100 million investment from Google Capital. Now, Google is exploring entering the same business itself. How Thumbtack fits into those plans is unclear, Mr. Zappacosta said. Other start-ups, like Pro.com, Porch and Redbeacon, are creating similar online marketplaces. Angie’s List, meanwhile, is elevating its game — last year it introduced a mobile app, called SnapFix, that lets a homeowner take a photo of, say, a broken screen door and receive bids to fix it. The efforts shuddered last month when Amazon announced it was starting Amazon Home Services, which provides consumers with a list of vetted and insured professionals to do things like mount a new television. Price quotes and scheduling are available during the checkout process. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive, had already invested in Pro.com, and Amazon is working in partnership with TaskRabbit, another player. Already, said Peter Faricy, vice president of Amazon Marketplace, the company has 2.4 million serve offers covering more 700 types of services. “I can tell you that with 85 million customers purchasing products from Amazon that needed installation or assembly, customers have told us that Amazon Home Services fills an important need,” he said. Of course, this is not just about building your cat tree or mounting your TV. For Amazon it is another step toward becoming the conduit through which we buy everything, not just goods but services and entertainment as well. Amazon also takes a cut of each transaction, 20 percent for a TV mounting job, for example. Meanwhile, the offerings are veering away from the everyday and into the wacky. Amazon’s “other services” section lists goat grazing and “silk aerialist.” “Amazon is always focused on having the widest selection on earth,” Mr. Faricy said, “and we will do the same with services.”\\n\\n\\nTwitter - which already makes 10% of its revenue from data licensing -  shuts off its firehose to boost its data analytics business: Late on Friday, Twitter announced that it would no longer license the full stream of half a billion daily messages on its service to third-party resellers. Anyone who wants access to the stream, known as the fire hose, will soon have to license the data from Twitter directly. On the surface, the announcement affects just the two remaining buyers of Twitter data, DataSift and NTT, and also suggests that Twitter no longer wants to sell its data wholesale, just retail. But it’s also a deeper sign of the company’s intention to compete with — and perhaps cut out — many middlemen that profit from helping marketers make sense of the flood of tweets to run their businesses more intelligently. In a blog post, Twitter said the decision was a natural outgrowth of its acquisition of Gnip, the leading reseller of Twitter data, about a year ago. “Direct relationships help Twitter develop an understanding of customer needs, get direct feedback for the product road map and work more closely with data customers to enable the best possible solutions for the brands that rely on Twitter data to make better decisions,” wrote Zach Hofer-Shall, head of the company’s ecosystem program. What he didn’t say is that Twitter also thinks direct relationships will make more money. Last year, the company generated $147 million, or roughly 10 percent of its revenue, from data licensing and other services, and Twitter’s leaders see data as an area that they have only begun to mine. Chris Moody, the former chief of Gnip and now Twitter’s vice president for data strategy, sketched out the data vision at a November meeting with Wall Street analysts. “In the future, every significant business decision will have Twitter data as an input, because why wouldn’t you?” he said. “Why wouldn’t you add into your business decision-making, ‘What does the world think about this topic at this particular time or at a previous moment of time, maybe last year when we ran this campaign,’ that type of thing?” As an example, Mr. Moody described how T-Mobile scanned tweets from customers suggesting they were planning to dump the carrier because it didn’t offer the iPhone. T-Mobile later used that data to target those customers and persuade them to stay, cutting its churn by 50 percent. While Twitter primarily works with dozens of data analysis and software companies, such as Adobe, Spredfast and Salesforce.com, as a data supplier, it also wants to move up the value chain and eventually compete with those very same companies. It is already packaging its feed with data from other social sources, such as Yahoo’s Tumblr, and wants to expand that further. That’s a service that DataSift, one of the two resellers that were just cut off, also provides. And Twitter is working with business services companies like IBM to train thousands of consultants and conduct case studies of how Twitter data can transform specific industries. “We see the data licensing business as extremely complementary to the advertising business,” Mr. Moody said in a February interview. Once businesses understand the customer insights they get from tweets, he said, “when I want to advertise something, where would I turn? Twitter.”\\n\\n\\nChina Is Said to Use Powerful New Weapon to Censor Internet: Late last month, China began flooding American websites with a barrage of Internet traffic in an apparent effort to take out services that allow China’s Internet users to view websites otherwise blocked in the country. Initial security reports suggested that China had crippled the services by exploiting its own Internet filter — known as the Great Firewall — to redirect overwhelming amounts of traffic to its targets. Now, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Toronto say China did not use the Great Firewall after all, but rather a powerful new weapon that they are calling the Great Cannon. The Great Cannon, the researchers said in a report published on Friday, allows China to intercept foreign web traffic as it flows to Chinese websites, inject malicious code and repurpose the traffic as Beijing sees fit. The system was used, they said, to intercept web and advertising traffic intended for Baidu — China’s biggest search engine company — and fire it at GitHub, a popular site for programmers, and GreatFire.org, a nonprofit that runs mirror images of sites that are blocked inside China. The attacks against the services continued on Thursday, the researchers said, even though both sites appeared to be operating normally. But the researchers suggested that the system could have more powerful capabilities. With a few tweaks, the Great Cannon could be used to spy on anyone who happens to fetch content hosted on a Chinese computer, even by visiting a non-Chinese website that contains Chinese advertising content. “The operational deployment of the Great Cannon represents a significant escalation in state-level information control,” the researchers said in their report. It is, they said, “the normalization of widespread and public use of an attack tool to enforce censorship.” The researchers, who have previously done extensive research into government surveillance tools, found that while the infrastructure and code for the attacks bear similarities to the Great Firewall, the attacks came from a separate device. The device has the ability not only to snoop on Internet traffic but also to alter the traffic and direct it — on a giant scale — to any website, in what is called a “man in the middle attack.” China’s new Internet weapon, the report says, is similar to one developed and used by the National Security Agency and its British counterpart, GCHQ, a system outlined in classified documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden, the former United States intelligence contractor. The American system, according to the documents, which were published by The Intercept, can deploy a system of programs that can intercept web traffic on a mass scale and redirect it to a site of their choosing. The N.S.A. and its partners appear to use the programs for targeted surveillance, whereas China appears to use the Great Cannon for an aggressive form of censorship.\\n\\n\\nSpotify Said to Seek Financing to Value Music Site at $8 Billion: Spotify Ltd. is in the process of raising new financing that would value the largest subscription music-streaming service at about $8 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. That valuation is double what the company was worth when it raised money in November 2013. The latest round totals about $400 million, according to one of the individuals, and comes from a group that includes Goldman Sachs Group and an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday. Spotify continues to raise money as it tries to build a global subscription music service before Apple Inc. or Google Inc., which are both pursuing the same market. Spotify has more than 60 million users, a quarter of whom pay $9.99 for a monthly, ad-free version. Like Pandora Media Inc., a public company valued at $3.55 billion, Spotify pays a large percentage of its revenue to record labels and publishers for the right to license their music. With sales of both CDs and digital downloads in decline, the three major record labels -- Vivendi SA’s Universal Music Group, Sony Corp.’s Sony Music Entertainment and Access Industries’ Warner Music Group -- view streaming as the key to future growth. Though the labels own a stake in Spotify, they have complained about the money they receive from the company and pushed for greater restrictions to its free service. Spotify has resisted those overtures, arguing that an appealing free service is the best way to lure customers who will then subscribe. Listeners must have a subscription to access the full offering on a mobile phone.\\n\\n\\nWhatever Happened To PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)? Why do people still spin up and set up their own AWS and Compute Engine instances? Why have App Engine and Heroku and Elastic Beanstalk not conquered all? Is fine-grained control really that important? I suspect the reason is three-pronged: cost, lock-in, and culture. App Engine’s prices drop regularly, but they’re voluminous and confusing, and a single instance — a pretty puny virtual machine — costs more than a dollar day, not counting storage or bandwidth. Same for Heroku. You get more bang-per-buck by simply buying and running your own servers. You also get enormously larger headaches, and significantly slower development time; but that tradeoff isn’t worth it for many. Then there’s lock-in. Once you build your app atop App Engine’s custom APIs, you’re committed; there’s no easy way to back away and go to another provider. The lock-in is less for other PaaS providers, but it’s still there. There is no universal PaaS equivalent of de facto IaaS (infrastructure-as-a-service) standards such as OpenStack or Docker. The third, least valid, and arguably most powerful reason is culture. Companies don’t want to give up perceived control over their systems–even if that control is never worth its associated complexity–and sysadmins, understandably, don’t want to evolve themselves out of a job. The thing about all three of those reasons not to go PaaS, however, is that they’re temporary. Costs keep dropping. Culture keeps changing. And there are signs of slow movement towards interchangeable PaaS services and standards. (You could argue that Docker itself is a stride in that direction.) In the early days of electricity, factories all had their own generators; then, eventually, they moved to the grid. IaaS is the equivalent of every individual company getting their raw electrical power from the grid … but stepping it down with their own transformers and converting from three-phase to one-phase in-house. I suspect we’re still en route towards a largely PaaS world where server code mostly just runs, without developers knowing or caring about the servers in question. It’s just happening a little slower than I’d like.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon adds Machine Learning to AWS; to Sell Predictions in Cloud Race Against Google and Microsoft: On Thursday, Amazon Web Services announced that it was selling to the public the same kind of software it uses to figure out what products Amazon puts in front of a shopper, when to stage a sale or who to target with an email offer. The techniques, called machine learning, are applicable for technology development, finance, bioscience or pretty much anything else that is getting counted and stored online these days. In other words, almost everything. AWS’s introduction of the product, called Amazon Machine Learning, follows Microsoft’s announcement last summer of an online machine learning service to complement its Azure public cloud computing business. Last month, Google took a dramatic step in how it holds corporate data by lowering the cost, with an eye to becoming the analysis and prediction hub for the world’s companies. The services offered by Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google draw off each company’s relative strength. Microsoft has Excel, by far the most widely used analysis tool in the world. Most people actively developing businesses on the web are familiar with Google Analytics. AWS appears to offer much of its own internal decision-making process. With Amazon Web Services’ new features, “it will bring an entirely new decision-making technology into an organization,” said Matt Wood, the head of data science at AWS. “It can provide a company with information on the challenges facing them, or an overlay about what to do next.” Mr. Wood devoted four years of studying for his Ph.D., which he got 15 years ago, to solving a problem in protein folding, an essential part of genetics research. Using the new AWS product, he said, that would take about a week. At this point, there is no need to pick a winner in the cloud race among Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google. The real point is that if all of these cheap cloud companies are offering low-budget data science, it is almost certain to spread widely. While machine learning is expensive and arcane, if it becomes cheap and easy, it will get stuck onto all sorts of things, not just better online selling, or the way that Netflix uses it to recommend your next movie. This would be bad news for companies like IBM, which has spent billions on analytics companies and mathematicians, or the SAS Institute, a maker of big predictive software packages. Much of what these companies do will almost certainly become cheaper, based on what Amazon Web Services is charging. In testing its software, AWS put two engineers on the problem of telling the gender of a person’s name. Using conventional means, the company said, the team gained 92 percent accuracy in 45 days. Using the new Amazon Machine Learning product, one engineer reached the same accuracy in 20 minutes.\\n\\n\\nTeens aren’t fleeing Facebook as quickly as some thought: It\\'s not always clear how teens are really using social media these days. To explore the question, The Pew Research Center asked over 1,000 respondents, between ages 13 and 17, for their thoughts, and included them in a report published Thursday. Here are few key takeaways: Teen smartphone use is super, super high. A majority of teens have smartphones -- a fact that doesn\\'t change even when looking at different income levels. Of teens who live in households that make less than $30,000 per year, 61 percent have access to a smartphone. Among the richest teens (households over $75,000), it\\'s 78 percent.  Overall, a full 73 percent of teens have access to a smartphone; only 15 percent are rocking a basic phone. That also falls in line with what Pew found about adult smartphone use in a report released last week. Those anonymous apps? Not as popular as we may have thought. According to the Pew study, only 11 percent of all teen cell phone users use anonymous apps such as Whisper, YikYak and Ask.FM, which allow users to put up posts without revealing their identity. When these apps first came on the scene, they were seen as an outlet for teens who didn\\'t want to be haunted by a digital footprint down the line. But the use isn\\'t quite as high as researchers predicted. The study also found that girls use these sites slightly more than boys -- 13 percent of female respondents versus 8 percent among males. Facebook is still the number-one social media network among teens. Put your alarm bells away for now; Facebook isn\\'t exactly withering on the vine among teens. Facebook is used by 71 percent of all teens, followed in popularity by the Facebook-owned Instagram and Snapchat. Even within the 13-17 age group, however, there are differences in Facebook use. Older teens, ages 15 to 17, are far more likely to use Facebook than younger teens, listing it along with Snapchat and Twitter as their go-to networks. The 13- and 14-year-olds, meanwhile, told researchers they are more likely to turn to Instagram.\\n\\n\\nIndia startup action#1: Ola raises $310M led by DST Global; valued at $2.3B:  Ola (formerly Olacabs), has raised $310 million (Rs 1,952 crore) in its fresh round of funding led by Russian investment firm DST Global, according to VCCEdge, the data research platform of VCCircle, based on filings with Registrar of Companies. The latest deal values Ola at Rs 14,552 crore ($2.3 billion), almost four times its valuation in October when Japan’s SoftBank led a $210 million funding round in the company. DST, which backed India’s largest e-com venture Flipkart last year, has brought in Rs 1,153 crore ($185 million) and has picked 7.9 per cent stake, becoming the fourth-largest shareholder in the company behind SoftBank, Tiger Global and Matrix Partners. The round also saw participation from a bunch of other existing and new investors, including a few who joined in recently with the acquisition of TaxiForSure through a cash-and-stock transaction. While Ola’s single-biggest shareholder SoftBank did not participate in the latest funding, its first institutional backer Tiger Global brought in $40 million to restrict equity dilution.\\n\\n\\nIndia startup action #2: Urban Ladder raises $50M led by Sequoia & TR Capital: Urban Ladder, has secured $50 million in Series C round of funding led by Sequoia Capital and TR Capital. Existing investors Steadview Capital, SAIF Partners and Kalaari Capital also participated. Urban Ladder was launched in July 2012 and offers a curated range of over 4,000 products across more than 35 categories in furniture and home décor. It was co-founded by Ashish Goel and Rajiv Srivatsa. At present, Urban Ladder delivers to 12 cities in India (Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi/NCR, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad, Cochin Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Surat, Kolkata and Mangalore). Last year, it said it aims to hit 25-30 cities by March 2015. Now it has extended the time period to reach this goal. The latest funding comes just nine months after it raised $20 million in Series B round of led by Steadview Capital, with participation from SAIF Partners and Kalaari Capital. In the past, it has raised $5 million in Series A from SAIF and Kalaari and prior to that it got around $1 million from Kalaari. Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus, Tata Group, also made a small personal investment in the company in November 2014. Although the amount was not disclosed, it is believed to be in the region of around $1 million. It competes with the likes of Rocket Internet-incubated FabFurnish and Pepperfry.com, besides other horizontal e-commerce players such as Flipkart.com, Snapdeal.com and Amazon.in. Among the investors, the deal deepens Sequoia’s bet on vertical e-com space in India. The VC firm has backed several single vertical e-tailers and has just got an exposure to Snapdeal. The horizontal e-com marketplace has acquired FreeCharge in a deal which gives Sequoia among other VC investors of the mobile recharge company a stake in Snapdeal. TR Capital is a Hong Kong-based mid-market PE firm targeting investments in Asia. This is its second known investment in India. Early this year TR Capital co-invested with TPG and others in eyewear e-tailer Lenskart.\\n\\n\\nAmazon sues to block alleged fake reviews on its website: Amazon.com Inc has sued four websites to stop them from selling fake, positive product reviews. In a complaint filed on Wednesday in King County Superior Court in Washington, Amazon said the bogus reviews undermine a system that the Seattle-based online retailer launched 20 years ago to help shoppers using its website decide what to buy. Four- and five-star reviews can aid sales, especially if customers perceive them as unbiased. But Amazon said the defendants are misleading customers, and through their activity generating improper profit for themselves and a \"handful\" of dishonest sellers and manufacturers. \"While small in number, these reviews threaten to undermine the trust that customers, and the vast majority of sellers and manufacturers, place in Amazon, thereby tarnishing Amazon\\'s brand,\" the complaint said. The defendants include Jay Gentile, a California man who allegedly runs buyazonreviews.com, as well as unnamed operators of buyamazonreviews.com, bayreviews.net and buyreviewsnow.com, according to the complaint. Amazon said the defendants have caused reviews to be posted on its website intermittently, through a \"slow drip\" designed to evade its detection systems, at a typical cost of $19 to $22 per review.\\n\\n\\nGlobal PC Shipments Decline as Corporate Spending Fades: Worldwide personal-computer shipments fell 5.2 percent in the first quarter as corporate spending that helped slow declines last year tailed off, market researcher Gartner Inc. reported. About 71.7 million units were shipped in the quarter, down from 75.7 million in the same period a year earlier, Gartner said Thursday in a report. Market researcher IDC reported a wider decline, finding that 68.5 million units were shipped, a 6.7 percent drop. IDC said it was the lowest number of PC shipments since the first quarter of 2009. The first quarter’s decline represents a return to a trend that saw PC sales hurt as consumers in emerging markets increasingly turned to smartphones and tablets to get online. That three-year downturn slowed temporarily last year as companies replaced corporate hardware that had become obsolete after Microsoft Corp. ended support of its Windows XP operating system. “That replacement cycle faded in the first quarter of 2015,” Mikako Kitagawa, an analyst at Gartner, said in a statement. Lenovo Group Ltd. widened its lead as the top supplier in the quarter, grabbing an 18.9 percent market share. The Chinese company shipped 13.58 million PCs worldwide, an increase of 5.7 percent from a year earlier, Gartner said. The only other gain among the top five companies was by Hewlett-Packard Co., which posted a 2.5 percent rise in shipments and boosted its share to 17.3 percent of the market. Dell Inc.’s shipments slipped 5.1 percent in the quarter, its first fall in six quarters, leaving it with a 12.6 percent market share. Its position was hurt by the decline in corporate purchases, Gartner said.\\n\\n\\nIntel Said to End Talks to Buy Chip Designer Altera: Intel has ended discussions to buy Altera, a designer of specialized computer chips, people briefed on the matter said on Thursday, putting to rest what would have been the company’s biggest-ever takeover. The collapse of the talks halts what would have been the latest in a series of mergers of chip makers and designers as companies turn to consolidation to gain negotiating leverage with customers. And yet investors still appear hopeful that Altera will ultimately be sold. Though shares of Altera initially fell after CNBC reported the end of negotiations, they closed up 3 percent on Thursday, at $43.33. Shares in Intel ended down slightly, at $31.24. Intel first made a takeover offer several weeks ago of more than $50 a share, a premium of more than 40 percent to Altera’s stock price at the time, one of the people said. Ultimately, however, Altera rejected the approach, and talks between the two companies had gone quiet in recent days. It was unclear whether the talks would be revived. A takeover would have been, by far, the biggest deal by Intel in its 46-year history. To date, its largest takeover was the $7.5 billion acquisition of McAfee, a security software maker. Just six of the company’s deals have been worth more than $1 billion. Several analysts have said that they still think Intel will be on the hunt for acquisitions.\\n\\n\\nLinkedIn to Buy Lynda.com, an Online Learning Company: LinkedIn, the professional networking site, is branching out yet again. The site said on Thursday that it had agreed to buy Lynda.com, an online learning company that teaches career skills, for about $1.5 billion in cash and stock. It is the biggest acquisition by LinkedIn in its 12-year history as it continues to expand beyond its core social network. In the past, LinkedIn has said that users visit its site most often to update their résumés when they are looking for a new job. The company earns most of its revenue from subscriptions to its premium services and advertising on its site, generating $2.2 billion in sales last year. But the company has labored to become more than just an online repository for résumés and job histories. For instance, in 2012, LinkedIn began soliciting influential business personalities like Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, to write original content for the site. The company hired Dan Roth, a former editor at Fortune magazine, to be LinkedIn’s executive editor. Last year, the company introduced blogging capabilities for LinkedIn’s users, essentially becoming an original content platform. And two years ago, the company bought Pulse, the maker of a newsreader app, for $90 million. LinkedIn binds all those services into what it calls the economic graph, where users can connect to both new professional opportunities and the skills needed to take advantage of them. But e-learning and professional development services is an entirely new category for the company, and LinkedIn hopes it will be another way it can lure users back to using its site every week or even every day. Lynda.com was started two decades ago as a small online portal for students to learn web design skills. It was founded by the husband-and-wife team of Lynda Weinman and Bruce Heavin, themselves graphic design experts who have both held positions at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif. Today, Lynda.com focuses on a number of subjects, like management skills, programming and video. It sells subscriptions that start at $25 a month. The company collected more than $150 million in revenue last year and has turned a profit since 1997.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Watch Reviews: You’ll Want One, but You Don’t Need One: Should you buy an Apple Watch? The first reviews are here. The first reviews of the Apple Watch are in, and the verdict is: This is a good product with a bright future. But maybe don\\'t buy one quite yet. That\\'s not to say the reviews weren\\'t glowing, because they were. Anyone who was hoping that the Watch would flop out of the box and fall short of the high standard that Apple boasts for its products is going to be disappointed. There\\'s also no doubt, from these reviews, that Apple\\'s smartwatch is immediately the best of its kind on the market. \"[The] Apple Watch is, above all, a satisfying indulgence,\" writes Yahoo Tech\\'s David Pogue. \"It’s a luxury. You might buy it to bring you pleasure — and it will — much the way you might buy a really nice car, some really nice clothes, or a really nice entrée.\" Overall, reviewers say that the Watch works well, has the battery life it needs and features such as Apple Pay work well. Plus, the Watch just feels nice. But there are criticisms, and strong ones, about how far the product needs to go to appeal to everyone. At the very least, it certainly is -- to quote the headline on The New York Times\\' Farhad Manjoo review--  a device that comes into its own after a \"steep learning curve.\" The gripes, as always, are the most telling part of the reviews. Manjoo, for example, warns that this is not necessarily a simple device to understand. That\\'s contrary to Apple\\'s normal reputation -- the iPhone, for example, is a great smartphone for technophobes because it\\'s so easy to navigate. But that\\'s not the market that should (or probably would) pick up the first generation of the Watch. Other criticisms range from the fact that the device is a little slow (Nilay Patel, The Verge) to complaints that it\\'s still a little too clunky to be fashionable (Lauren Goode, Re/Code), which could pose a hurdle for wider adoption. Ed Baig at USA Today  says that he also doesn\\'t particularly like making phone calls on it -- though that\\'s not going to stop him from buying one of his own. There are also some greater concerns about smoothly it actually works. Several reviewers said that apps made by companies other than Apple were slow to load and work on the Watch. That will improve over time as software developers get more comfortable with the platform, but is an early hiccup worth noting. It also relies on other Apple software such as the company\\'s Siri voice control software, which Manjoo notes fails to work as often as it\\'s successful. Mashable\\'s Lance Ulanoff says that it\\'s not spectacularly good at working as a fitness tracker, either. That\\'s one of the main draws of the wearable market right now, as products such as Jawbone and Fitbit have shown, and one of the easiest markets for Apple to pick up. The convenience of having a fitness tracker with some phone functions might be enough to win converts, but it seems that, for now, fitness management isn\\'t exactly a killer app for the Watch.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba finance arm Ant Financial to launch online private bank in June: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\\'s finance arm will launch its private internet bank, to be called MYbank in June, Yuan Leiming, Ant Financial\\'s general manager of its finance division, told Reuters in an interview in Beijing on Thursday. Ant Financial will hold a 30 percent stake. Other shareholders will be: Shanghai Fosun Industrial Technology Development Co. Ltd, a subsidiary of Fosun International Ltd, with a 25 percent stake; a subsidiary of Wanxiang Group will hold 18 percent; and Ningbo Jinrun Asset Management will own 16 percent. Alibaba and affiliate Ant have big ambitions for financial services in China, which have traditionally been geared toward larger and state-owned businesses and neglected individuals and smaller enterprises.\\n\\n\\nFacebook Launches Dedicated Web Interface For Messenger: Ever try to read a Facebook message on the web and get distracted by your News Feed and notifications? Well now Facebook has a way to let you use Messenger in peace from your web browser. Today it launched Messenger.com as a dedicated chat interface. It’s rolling out worldwide for English users, with support for more languages to come. You can still send messages from Facebook.com as always, but Messenger.com could become a favorite of busy users concerned with productivity, or those that use Facebook to chat with friends but don’t like the social content chaos of its main site. The company tells me the “dedicated desktop messaging experience” is “meant to be complimentary to the Messenger mobile app”. The move follows the launch of Facebook acquisition WhatsApp’s web interface in January. One big question is whether Facebook will release a desktop client for Messenger. That could rescue chat from the crowded web browser and make it instantly accessible with a single click from people’s desktops.\\n\\n\\nYouTube Story #2: Google Plots New YouTube Subscription Service as Soon as This Year: Google Inc. plans to offer a subscriber version of YouTube as soon as this year, letting viewers see millions of videos without having to sit through ads. Revenue from the new feature, which will put Google into more direct competition with streaming services such as Netflix Inc. and Hulu LLC, will be shared with video creators, Google told them in an e-mail that was obtained by Bloomberg. The service may debut by the end of the year, said a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the plans aren\\'t public. \"By creating a new paid offering, we\\'ll generate a new source of revenue that will supplement your fast growing advertising service,\" the letter said. Google has been moving closer to charging users for content; the Web company introduced a subscription-style music service within YouTube in November, and has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on talent and production facilities to boost original content on the video website, which has more than 1 billion monthly viewers. With ad-free subscriptions, Google is moving closer to competing with streaming services, including HBO Now (which debuted this week), for people\\'s attention as they spend more time watching videos on the Web and on mobile devices. YouTube will offer all the same videos without ads for a monthly fee, which hasn\\'t been set yet, according to the note. The service is also likely to include offline access. Google is alerting content creators because it wants them to agree to new terms that would let it include clips in the subscription product. \"We\\'re increasingly moving into an age where consumers are learning to avoid advertising,\" said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG. \"Between DVRs, Netflix and now Amazon, we\\'re increasingly learning to lead an ad-free life.\" The move to introduce subscriptions is part of a broader shift at Google to generate more income that isn\\'t based on advertising.\\n\\n\\nYouTube Story #2: YouTube video-sharing service is adding tools to make advertisements running on mobile devices more interactive, while cutting down on errant clicks. YouTube’s TrueView ads, which give visitors the option of skipping promotional clips before they’re over, will add a feature called cards to let advertisers highlight related content during videos, YouTube said Wednesday in a blog post. The new tools will also allow direct links to outside websites on mobile devices or desktop computers. In the past, only ads on desktops showed links and annotations. All YouTube video ads will also limit clickable links to boxes near the edge of the video player. In the past, viewers could click on any part of the display, making it more likely that they might accidentally engage with the video with a tap of a finger or mouse. Google is investing in YouTube’s services as it seeks to attract marketers to its platform amid competition from rivals such as Hulu LLC and Facebook Inc. The number of advertisers using TrueView ads, which aim to give users more control over how they watch promotions, jumped 45 percent last year, the Mountain View, California-based company said. The new tools aim to make it simpler for marketers to make their clips more engaging on any device, said Phil Farhi, the director of product for YouTube ads. “It allows us to do interactivity in a cross-screen world,” Farhi said in an interview. “The advertiser doesn’t have to create new assets for every screen.”\\n\\n\\nMeasuring Social ‘Trust’ to Make Loans: Alternative consumer lenders tend to fit into one of two camps: peer-to-peer marketplaces like Lending Tree and Prosper, and start-ups using data science to parse credit risk, like Affirm, Earnest and Zest Finance.Vouch Financial, which is emerging from its pilot testing phase this week, has an unusual spin on the data science approach. Big data lenders often analyze a person’s social network on LinkedIn or Facebook as one signal, among many, for hints about how reliable a payer a loan candidate is likely to be. But Vouch wants you to construct a social network of people who trust you financially — people who will, yes, vouch for you.The Vouch formula looks to back to a bygone era of banking when community bankers routinely asked their customers for “social character” references before granting loans. “We’ve taken that principle and digitized it,” said Yee Lee, co-founder and chief executive of Vouch.It also borrows from the concept of co-signing for loans, when a relative or friend is liable for repayment if the borrower turns out to be a deadbeat.Founded in 2013, Vouch made its first loan last October. By now, Mr. Lee said, Vouch has made “hundreds” of loans ranging in size from $500 to $15,000. They are installment loans with repayment typically stretched over 12 to 36 months.Borrowers build online trust networks by sending messages to friends and family members to vouch for them, and typically to commit some amount of money if the borrower does not repay. The people in the network are not asked to co-sign the loan in a traditional sense. But they are asked to explain their relationship to the person and commit an amount of money they will pay if the borrower does not repay. The commitment can be as little as $25 but has been up to $1,000 or more.So joining a person’s vouch network is an expression of trust in that person with a dollar amount placed on it. The vouchers sign an electronic agreement to pay, if necessary, that is legally enforceable, Mr. Lee explained.The members of a trust network fill out online surveys, identifying themselves — which is then verified by Vouch — and they agree to have their own credit histories looked up. Several thousand people, Mr. Lee said, have already joined the company’s networks of reciprocal trust. “We’re ingesting a lot of data,” Mr. Lee said.The company is really just getting started, but the idea is to collect data on trust signals and experience on lending, and build increasingly refined and accurate predictive models. Richard Lewis, Vouch’s chief risk officer, said the goal was to bring the concept of community banking reference checks into the digital age. “We want to make it analytic, quantifiable, scalable and fair,” he said. Mr. Lee provided a simplified example of different trust networks and lending decisions: Take two young people, both 22 years old, both living in Westwood, Calif., and both with 620 FICO scores — just into subprime territory by the traditional FICO yardstick of creditworthiness, which relies heavily on a person’s credit history. One borrower is a young man and has assembled a 10-person network. It’s a sizable number of trust connections, but they all come from the same address, the fraternity house at the university from which the borrower recently graduated. The second loan candidate is a young woman with only three people in her network. But one is her mother who is willing to vouch $1,000, and Mom has an 800 FICO score. And the other two people in her network live in Austin, Tex., and Newark., and have the same last name as the young woman. The 22-year-old young woman, Mr. Lee observed, would get somewhat better terms on her loan, given the strength rather than the breadth of her trust network. The start-up’s borrowers range in age from their 20s to 50s, across a demographic spectrum, but the most common loan use so far has been to pay off high-rate credit card debt, Mr. Lee said. Vouch has apparently done a lot of spade work with regulators. It is chartered, Mr. Lee said, in 50 states. To date, it has raised $3.6 million from venture capital firms including IDG Ventures and Greylock Partners.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter shares up\\xa0on takeover bid rumors,\\xa0unusual options activity:\\xa0Is Twitter facing a takeover bid? Some investors hope so. Twitter shares are way up in Tuesday trading, and not because people really like the new design of its tweet-quoting feature.  Rumors are flying after numerous press reports, including one from Barron\\'s citing \"chatter\" that Twitter is fending off a takeover bid. According to Barron\\'s Tiernan Ray, that \"unsubstantiated chatter\" has also identified Goldman Sachs as the advising firm Twitter\\'s hired to keep takover offers at bay. Twitter declined to comment. The company\\'s shares closed nearly 4 percent up  to $52.87 per share. The stock opened at $51.01 and went as high as $53.28 on the admittedly sketchy reports. This is not the first time there\\'s been talk of a Twitter takeover. It\\'s been batted about for years, well before Twitter went public, and the idea resurfaced as recently as January that Google might be the suitor in question. Google has again been named as a possible buyer in this latest round of rumors; the company declined to comment on rumor and speculation. Twitter\\'s had some problems growing its audience since going public, which it\\'s addressed by revamping the site\\'s design to make it easier for newcomers to understand. Unusual options activity: Twitter options active on deal chatter: Twitter Inc\\'s (TWTR.N) shares jumped 5 percent and activity in its options surged on Tuesday on unsubstantiated market chatter about the company fending off a takeover bid. The microblogging service provider\\'s shares rose to $53.28, the highest they have been since October, on market chatter that the company has hired advisers to rebuff a takeover bid. Twitter\\'s options were unusually active on Tuesday with total volume more than 250,000 contracts, or twice the average daily volume, according to Trade Alert data. Call options, usually used to place bullish bets on shares, outnumbered puts by a ratio of nearly 3 to 1. The reading is about the highest it has been in favor of calls since the beginning of March.\\n\\n\\nIndia startup action #1: Quikr gets $150M funding as it battles global giants for India’s classifieds market: Quikr, a classifieds site that’s one of India’s best-funded startups, today revealed that it has secured a further US$150 million in funding. This is its eighth major round of funding, which now totals nearly US$350 million. “The big things for us going forward are to continue to innovate for India, innovate for mobile, and go deeper in key categories where we already are leaders,” said Pranay Chulet, founder and CEO of Quikr, in a statement. The fresh investment will go towards Quikr’s push for smartphone users and to help build an upcoming, spin-off real estate portal, reports NextBigWhat. More here: Quikr raises $150M from Tiger Global, Kinnevik & Steadview Capital: Online classifieds site Quikr.com, has raised $150 million (over Rs 900 crore) from existing investors Tiger Global and Sweden’s Kinnevik besides a new investor Steadview Capital Management, it said on Tuesday. The venture essentially competes with Naspers-backed OLX in the P2P classifieds business in India. This fresh round of funding will be used to further invest in Quikr’s fast growing mobile business and in its key categories such as cars, real estate, jobs and services. Founded in 2008 by Chulet and Jiby Thomas (who quit the firm later), Quikr was originally started as Kijiji India. The firm later rebranded to Quikr. It is a large scale cross-category classifieds business with over 30 million consumers. These consumers come to Quikr to sell, buy, rent or find products and services in a variety of categories such as electronics and household goods, real estate, cars, bikes, jobs and services. The firm claims that small businesses across 1,000 cities are using the site. It recently announced the launch of a new classifieds website for real estate called quikrhomes.com to allow B2C as well as C2C discovery of properties up for sale as well as those available for rent. For new investor Steadview Capital, this marks another large deal in India. Last year the Hong Kong-based alternative assets manager had backed marquee firms in the digital commerce space in India—e-com venture Flipkart and online cabs aggregator Ola.\\n\\n\\nApple to Push Watch Buyers Online to Avoid Long Lines at Stores: When it comes to buying the Apple Watch, it’s time to think different. Angela Ahrendts, Apple Inc.’s sales chief, wants to scrap the company’s tradition of having customers wait in line, sometimes for days, to get their hands on the latest gadget. Apple has instructed its sales force to prod shoppers to the company’s website to purchase the new smartwatch, which can be pre-ordered Friday. “The days of waiting in line and crossing fingers for a product are over for our customers,” according to a memo to Apple sales staff. “This is a significant change in mindset and we need your help to make it happen.” Business Insider earlier reported on the memo. The approach is the first indication of where Ahrendts is taking the Apple buying experience since joining the company about a year ago from British luxury retailer Burberry Group Plc. While the Apple watch starts as low as $349, its top-end $17,000 gold version pushes the Cupertino, California-based company into a new, lofty realm. “This is not simply a consumer-electronics good -- it’s a luxury good,” J.P. Gownder, an analyst with Forrester Research, said. “There are a lot of good reasons to” to change “but there is that danger that it maybe a little bit, literally, buzz killing.” Apple on Friday begins taking pre-orders online after 3:01 a.m. New York time. Shoppers also will be able to try on the device starting Friday, by appointment. Apple hasn’t begun accepting appointments yet. The watch officially goes on sale April 24 in eight countries and Hong Kong. Encouraging Apple Watch shoppers to make appointments may help the company explain the complicated pricing and options and sell customers on why they would really want it, Gownder said. The watch is being offered in two sizes and three styles as well as different options for bands. The iPhone 6, for example, has three memory and three color options. The watch -- which aims to provide new ways to communicate, track fitness goals and give directions, among other things -- is the first new gadget from Apple in five years. The visibility may help bring greater attention to the total market for wearable devices, such as offerings from Samsung Electronics Co. The global market for all smartwatches may rise to 28.1 million units this year from 4.6 million, according to researcher Strategy Analytics. Sales of the Apple Watch may reach almost 14 million in the fiscal year through September, according to the average estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.\\n\\n\\nSquare Is Using Customer Data to Create Targeted Email Campaigns for Brands Leaping from mobile payments to marketing: Linking online and offline marketing is the ultimate challenge for bricks-and-mortar retailers these days. And after years of powering credit card transactions and mobile payments for small businesses, Square thinks it has found a solution. Today, the San Francisco-based payment company launches Square Marketing—a marketing tool that lets small businesses target customers who shop in stores through email promotions. Since launching in 2009, the mobile payment company has helped merchants and businesses electronically accept credit card payments, collecting a trove of data in the process. Now, the goal is to help brands take action on that data. \"The first big step is to empower these small businesses with tools that help them deepen their relationships with their customers,\" said Kevin Burke, head of customer acquisition at Square. \"For the first time, small businesses can now deliver a message to the right person at the right time with the right context, which will increase the likelihood for that customer to value that engagement and also act on it.\" Merchants that use Square get monthly reports that break down anonymous payment data. Now, businesses will be able to see which sales came from new customers versus returning shoppers. They\\'ll also find out how often customers visited their stores each month. With that data, businesses can target shoppers through email marketing. Emails are targeted based on three groups of customers: those that make three, two or fewer than one visit to a store every six months. Businesses either pay 10 cents per email or $15 a month for unlimited emails. Square has templates brands can use to push out promotions, events and announcements. After sending out an email blast, Square compares email recipients with credit card swipes to show marketers how it drove actual sales. During the tool\\'s pilot program, Square claims merchants doubled their email open rates and redemptions, generating $1 million in sales. Still, Square has a number of competitors that are all going after small businesses. \"By getting into this space, they are officially becoming a small business platform, similar to where GoDaddy is trying to go,\" said Abid Chaudhry, a senior analyst at BIA/Kelsey. \"It\\'s a really saturated market, so they have to differentiate themselves with data.\" Jeanne Jennings, managing director of digital marketing at Digital Prism Advisors, went so far as to say that connecting offline data to email marketing could be a game-changer that puts Square ahead of big-name email service providers like ExactTarget and Silverpop. \"If they\\'re going to tie in data, I would suggest that it\\'s more powerful than a Silverpop,\" Jennings said of Square. \"[The opportunity] is huge and is something not a lot of people are doing successfully.\" But Christopher Donald, a strategist at Inbox Group, predicted larger email service providers like Square won\\'t crush Silverpop and ExactTarget because Square primarily works with small brands, like mom-and-pop coffee shops and clothing boutiques. Small business owners aren\\'t as well versed as big brands in digital marketing, which means Square may need to teach them the ins and outs of email marketing. \"They have a chance with small businesses, but most small businesses have little experience with email marketing and even less with targeted messaging based on data collected,\" Donald noted. \"So they\\'ll need to make it really simple, automated and easy, or the small business owner won\\'t take the time to learn anything that has a large learning curve.\"\\n\\n\\nXiaomi ends exclusive arrangement with Flipkart, will sell on Amazon, Snapdeal, others in India: When Xiaomi first launched in India last July, the Chinese gadget maker did so with online-only sales through one ecommerce store – Flipkart. That ends today as Xiaomi’s India boss, Manu Kumar Jain, announced a wide array of new ways for Indian consumers to buy its smartphones or tablets. Xiaomi has tapped Airtel India’s stores for sales before with the Redmi Note 4G, but the sales channels through Amazon India, Snapdeal, and The Mobile Stores are brand-new. The Mobile Stores has 300 outlets across the country. In addition to that, Jain announced today that Xiaomi would do away with its pre-registrations for flash sales of its Redmi 2 and Mi Pad in a sign that the company is better able to produce supply to meet demand. Xiaomi’s flash sales have been criticized by some users for proving frustrating.\\n\\n\\nIndia startup action #2: Indian mobile wallet MobiKwik scores $25M from Sequoia, Amex, Tree Line, Cisco: Tree Line Asia, Cisco Investments, American Express, and Sequoia Capital are betting on MobiKwik. The firms gave close to US$25 million to the mobile wallet startup. Based in India, MobiKwik is a mobile payment solution. MobiKwik wants to be the only payment service people need. Since the startup has partnered with the major credit cards and 51 internet banking providers as well as 25,000 merchants, users can pay bills and buy products with the service. With partner companies, there is no need to input data like a credit card string. Users just need to sign in and pay, similar to rival Paytm. Cash can be added to your accounts at physical retail stores. Though a browser version exists, the company is best known for its Android, iOS, and Windows apps.\\n\\n\\nHP Comes to Terms With the Cloud: A year ago, Hewlett-Packard thought it was going to change cloud computing. Now it looks more as if cloud computing is changing HP, just as the company enters one of the greatest attempts at reorganization in the history of technology. Meg Whitman, HP’s chief executive, will at the end of October split HP  into two companies. One will be generally focused on business technology and one on consumer-friendly areas of personal computers and printers. HP thought it would compete with Amazon, Google, and Microsoft for business rentals of computing power via so-called public cloud assets. Companies like Netflix, Snapchat and 3M now run significant parts of their businesses in such clouds, and the field is growing rapidly. After looking at the market, however, HP is now ceding the public cloud. “We thought people would rent or buy computing from us,” said Bill Hilf, the head of HP’s cloud business. “It turns out that it makes no sense for us to go head-to-head.” HP is still selling servers, but increasingly it looks like its biggest customers will be cloud companies themselves, or other computing behemoths, like Facebook. For thousands of other customers, Ms. Whitman hopes to build smaller cloud systems, while figuring out ways these companies can also use Amazon or Microsoft. One such buyer, the Fox Entertainment Group, uses HP computers to create content, but it looks to Microsoft to run its email or handle heavy workloads of noncritical information It uses a cloud run by Salesforce.com for sales management, and others to share things like the latest film both with artists inside Fox and with outside special effects and marketing companies. HP has some business in selling equipment, and more in the related businesses of management and security software, among other things, to hold the disparate parts together. “We have to balance decisions about the content we’re creating that we have to control, with security, financial and work-flow decisions,” said John Herbert, the chief information officer at Fox. “We’ve pushed HP to give us a lot of automation and flexibility.” That is a big change after an understandable mistake. HP dominated the sales of computer servers to business, so it probably looked like an easy transition to selling computing in a new way. In fact, the scale of the big public clouds, each with more than one million servers, is hard to learn, and the field is a tough place for newcomers to profit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon Woos EBay’s Once-Loyal Merchants With Sales Growth: EBay Inc.’s once-loyal merchants are moving more of their business to Amazon.com Inc., saying they get more for their money by selling merchandise via the Web retailer. Amazon’s pool of merchants climbed to more than 2 million in 2014, while the number of sellers on EBay has remained flat at about 25 million in the past two years. Businesses that at first set up online storefronts on EBay say they’re surprised how quickly sales surge on Amazon once products appear on both sites. Moving storefronts doesn’t come cheap. Amazon charges a premium for its logistics services, which include storage, packaging and ensuring products are shipped in a timely manner. Both companies have complex price formulas that vary by product category. While EBay typically charges about 10 percent of each item’s final sale price, Amazon takes 15 percent in most cases, with additional fees for optional storage and packaging. Many sellers say Amazon is worth the extra expense to achieve greater sales volumes and that it’s cheaper to let Amazon handle logistics than do it themselves. The number of units sold on Amazon’s marketplace doubled in 2014. Amazon -- which also sells goods from its own inventory of products, not just from third-party retailers, such as EBay’s marketplace -- attracted 174.9 million unique visitors in the U.S. in February, 46 percent more than EBay, according to ComScore Inc. EBay remains the leading marketplace, measured by the number of of sellers, which has remained steady at 25 million for the past two years, according to Ryan Moore, a spokesman for EBay. He declined to comment on any sales shift, referring instead to Donahoe’s previous statements on revenue growth. Amazon, based in Seattle, had more than 2 million merchants at the end of last year, up from more than 1 million at the end of 2013. Still, Amazon’s logistical support services and larger customer base make it attractive to sellers with high sales volumes of quick-moving inventory, while EBay remains more favorable to small sellers of collectibles and specialty items. Amazon, which has 270 million active buyers compared with EBay’s 155 million, has had a third-party marketplace since 2000 and started offering Fulfillment by Amazon in 2007. Some sellers have been wary of Amazon, since it can also be a retail competitor. The shift highlights the value of Amazon’s paid membership model and its investments in distribution. Amazon boasts tens of millions of customers who pay $99 a year for fast delivery, as well as offering online music and movies. Merchants are willing to pay Amazon more to access those shoppers and have Amazon handle and deliver their products. “You can draw a pretty straight line to the success and popularity of Amazon Prime,” said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. “People who used to shop all over the place are now doing most of their shopping on Amazon.” Three out of four merchants using the Fulfillment by Amazon warehousing, packaging and shipping service reported annual sales growth of 20 percent, according to a recent survey by Amazon. More than 40 percent of all products sold on Amazon comes from third-party merchants who pay Amazon a cut of each sale, said Tom Taylor, Amazon’s vice president of seller services. Those sellers are increasingly paying Amazon extra to handle storage and shipping, he said.\\n\\n\\nOYO Rooms, A Network of Branded Budget Hotels in India, Raises $25M: In the largest funding round to date for a Thiel Fellow project, Ritesh Agarwal has raised $25 million from Lightspeed, Sequoia and others to build a branded budget hotel network across India. Called OYO Rooms, the company partners with property owners across India and makes sure that their facilities meet a baseline of requirements from linen quality to breakfast to Internet access for a starting price of 999 rupees or $16 a night. The company, which has booked around 60,000 stays so far since starting almost two years ago, works with each partner hotel to improve their facilities over the span of a week before launching on the platform. While other tech companies like Airbnb also have a growing footprint across the country, Agarwal says that the Indian short-term rental market needs to guarantee a basic quality level that a ratings or reviews system meets only some of the time. While the U.S. and other European countries have long had chains like Best Western or Ibis, he argues that the Indian budget hotel market is still lacking in this area. He compares Airbnb to a Sidecar-like model while OYO has a more Uber-like approach where they focus on instant gratification and minimum quality standards. On the OYO platform, guests can do on-demand booking without waiting for a reply from a host, and they can check in and out instantaneously instead of waiting at a reservation desk. They’ve partnered with more than 200 hotels across 10 cities in India. By the end of the year, they plan to quintuple in size with a network of 1,000 hotels in 25 cities.  Along with Lightspeed and Sequoia, Greenoaks Capital and DSG Consumer Partners also participated in the round.\\n\\n\\nThe Hackathon Fast Track, From Campus to Silicon Valley: Hackathons have become commonplace among professional developers, especially in booming tech centers like San Francisco and New York, and have emerged as prime places for networking, job recruiting, entrepreneurial pitching and, in many cases, winning cash. (One sponsored by the tech company Salesforce famously offered a $1 million prize to the most innovative project.) Now weekend hackathons organized by and for students are surging in size, scale and frequency. “A few years ago, hackathons weren’t really that popular — it was sort of a subculture,” says Kathryn Siegel, a junior at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “There’s been an enormous explosion.” The longest-running collegiate hackathon, founded at the University of Pennsylvania in 2009, has since ballooned to accommodate 1,200 students each semester. Demand, though, is far outpacing growth. At TreeHacks, 2,500 applied for 500 spots. (Capacity was later expanded to 672, which required setting up a heated outdoor tent.) More than 250 participants traveled to Palo Alto, Calif., from some 60 universities, including five Ivy League schools, top-tier engineering programs like Carnegie Mellon, M.I.T. and Georgia Tech, and universities as far away as the United Kingdom and Taiwan. Hackathon-goers maintain that what motivates them is not the awards. Mr. Hashme, who directs the University of Maryland’s Bitcamp, has participated in more than 40 hackathons since 2013. He says he attends because they force him to learn new tech skills. “Sitting in your dorm alone and trying to work on something, you wind up doing things you regret later, like watching a movie or browsing the Internet,” he says. At hackathons he enjoys meeting like-minded students from across the country — “It’s a room full of doers.” Fostering an education-first ethos, collegiate hackathons encourage students to tinker with new software and hardware and challenge themselves, and students teach one another. “There’s an expert on nearly anything there,” says Dave Fontenot, a former director of MHacks. “If you ask who the best JavaScript person is, pretty soon you’re meeting a GitHub celebrity.” (GitHub, a user-generated online repository for sharing computer code, is like a Wikipedia for software.) At TreeHacks, a team of Apple engineers was on hand to mentor students at all hours of the night. Collegiate hackathons have replicated that scene on a far grander scale. Identifying talented coders who can dream big and thrive under pressure is particularly valuable to Silicon Valley. Since hackathons showcase some of the best, brightest and most motivated upstart programmers, the events have become a focal point for recruiting. Some say hackathons are as fruitful as job fairs.\\n\\n\\nSamsung Beats Analyst Predictions Despite Falling Profits: After a tough 2014 for Samsung Electronics, the beleaguered South Korean manufacturer said it expected earnings in the first quarter of 2015 to beat analyst forecasts, in an early sign of a possible turnaround for the company. In a news release, Samsung said its operating profit was likely to have fallen about 30 percent in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2014. Despite the drop, Samsung exceeded analyst expectations by posting an operating profit of about 5.9 trillion won, or $5.4 billion, in the quarter, down from 8.5 trillion won a year earlier. Sales totaled about 47 trillion won, down roughly 12 percent from 53.7 trillion won a year earlier. The figures are preliminary; Samsung will post final earnings later this month. Samsung’s forecast signals the sixth consecutive quarter of decline in operating profit, and highlights how competitive pressure from Chinese rivals at the low end of the market and Apple’s iPhone at the high end has been squeezing Samsung.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba-backed ShopRunner, brand-focused US e-commerce site, gains momentum, eyes China: ShopRunner Inc, the e-commerce startup backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd that styles itself in some ways as the anti-Amazon, more than doubled its users over the past year and hopes to do so again in 2015, Shoprunner\\'s chief executive said in an interview. The five-year old online retailer\\'s gains may allow it to win over more customers who prize convenience and experience over cost savings, while taking advantage of its Alibaba relationship to help American retailers sell to China\\'s still-growing middle class. ShopRunner borrows some of Amazon.com Inc\\'s innovations: it charges $79 for two-day shipping to Amazon\\'s $99. And it has an express checkout akin to its larger rival\\'s one-click-buying feature. But CEO Scott Thompson says ShopRunner aims to be more like an online shopping mall that showcases brands than an Amazon or eBay marketplace where the focus is on lowest price. It also gives partners - ranging from Cole Haan and Under Armour to Neiman Marcus [NMRCUS.UL] - ownership of customer data and relationships. \"These businesses spend a lot of money to do the right thing with their brands,\" Thompson told Reuters in an interview. \"I want the segment of customer who says I want to pay a fair price, but I want the experience to be predictable.\" ShopRunner is one of a number of startups nibbling away at Amazon\\'s dominance of the online arena.It remains to be seen whether any will make waves. The soon-to-be-launched Jet, for instance, is raising funds from investors at a rapid clip and hopes to carve out a niche in lowest-price shopping. ShopRunner membership is now at 2.4 million, though it is unclear how many of those users signed on through American Express Co, an investor in ShopRunner, which also offers its cardholders free membership. Beyond the numbers, Thompson says members are widening their spending - in much the same way shoppers patronize adjacent storefronts at the mall. Cross-shopping, when members who start out buying from one or two retailers evolve to shop from more and more, grew nearly 60 percent in 2014, from just under 20 percent previously. \"It\\'s that age-old tenant in the mall that draws customers in, and people around it benefit from the traffic,\" Thompson said. Over the longer term, Thompson hopes to take greater advantage of ties to Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce titan that paid $202 million for 39 percent of the company in 2013. ShopRunner is one of several U.S. e-commerce companies working with Alibaba and affiliate Alipay to help U.S. retailers access China. Through Alipay\\'s nascent \"ePass\" service, which aims to let Chinese customers buy and pay for goods from U.S. retailers hassle-free, ShopRunner helps Neiman Marcus and Cole Haan sell to consumers in China by marketing their brands to buyers there. As Alibaba\\'s biggest single U.S. e-commerce investment, ShopRunner will play a key role in Alipay\\'s effort, although it also has relationships with sites in which Alibaba has no equity holding. Thompson wouldn\\'t give specifics but said ShopRunner\\'s own four-month effort to sell through Alipay was going well and demonstrated the vast potential of a market in which retailers like Best Buy have made little headway despite years of effort. There\\'s some evidence Alibaba\\'s program is taking off. Gilt.com has seen a doubling in sales to China since it started working with Alibaba and Alipay.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow does Facebook know who your friends are? It’s a mystery that has nagged users since at least 2011, when the Irish Data Protection Commissioner conducted a full-scale investigation into the issue. But four years later, there’s still a lot of confusion and misinformation about what Facebook’s doing when it “finds” your friends. Did it scrape your phone for names and numbers? Run a reverse-image search of your picture? Compile a “shadow” or “ghost” profile on you over a period of years, just waiting for you to log on and “confirm” its guesses? Alas, Facebook’s actual process isn’t actually that sneaky or malicious. In fact, it involves this pretty complex academic field called, dun dun … network science. In a nutshell, whenever you sign up for a Facebook account, Facebook asks permission to look at your e-mail contacts if you’re on a computer, or your phone contacts if you’re on a smartphone. When you grant the site permission, it searches your contacts for users already on the network, and it searches other users’ uploaded contacts for you. That gives it a very primitive outline of your social circles: who you know, but not how you know them or how well. To refine that map, Facebook asks you more questions about yourself: where you went to school, when you were born, what city you live in. Each field in your Facebook profile and each interaction you make through that profile actually double as a source of data for Facebook’s mapping algorithms. What they’re trying to do is determine the structure of the network: where the cliques are, which people bridge them, who knows who. Once Facebook knows the structure of your social network, it can analyze it to predict (with startling accuracy!) not only the people you’re most likely to know now, but the people you’re most likely to know in the future. This isn’t magic: It’s actually closer to statistics. In the network, there are a set number of “nodes,” i.e., people, and a set number of “edges,” i.e., friendships. Given that, each nonexistent connection between two nodes is a statistical possibility. But not all nodes are created equal, so not all connections are equally likely. (I don’t anticipate befriending many 40-year-old guys in Siberia, say.) To estimate which connections are most likely, Facebook can run analyses against the structure of the network, using a long and entirely above-our-pay-grade list of coefficients and indices. Those coefficients account for a huge number of things: How many unusual commonalities do two people share, for instance? How many friends do they have in common? Which people in the network serve as rallying points, the people who know everyone? How many “degrees of separation” exist between them, how many friends of friends? In the end, Facebook’s friend-recommendation system isn’t magic or malice — just really good math. And guessing your future friends isn’t telling the future; it’s modeling the evolution of Facebook’s social graph.\\n\\n\\nAdvertising comes to Tinder:\\xa0This week, Tinder unveiled its first ad in the form of a video promoting Budweiser’s next #Whatever, USA campaign. The video ad will show up for Tinder users the next time they open the app, but much like Instagram’s foray into advertising, Tinder ensures that rolling out advertising on the platform will go slow. Within a few swipes, users will land on Bud Light’s profile with a special auto-playing video, asking users to enter into the next #UpForWhatever contest. #WhateverUSA is a campaign that has already worked once for Bud Light, where the brand builds a random party town for a week of ‘spontaneous fun’ with contest winners and celebrities in attendance. With the new Bud Light ad on Tinder, Users can swipe out of the video immediately, with the same animations for left-swipes (Pass) and right-swipes (Like), which will be recorded by Tinder for the brand. “If you think about the way Tinder works, with ‘like’ and ‘pass’, we have a really amazing signal for advertisers,” said Brian Norgard, VP of Advertising at Tinder. “We’re being careful to respect our core experience for our users, which ensures that we can give that data back to our brands in a really valuable way. The response so far has been off the charts. You won’t believe how many people will swipe right if the content is high quality.” Tinder is using this first advertising campaign as a way to test the waters, using a number of different video lengths across the course of the campaign. “The product is very early, and we’re just starting to learn how our users are reacting to this format,” said Sean Rad, cofounder and president at Tinder. “Based on that we’ll make decisions on where we want to take the product or if we even want to proceed. Like everything else we do, we care a lot about the user experience and will protect a good balance between enjoying that uninterrupted Tinder experience with asking you to hear something from a sponsor or advertiser.” Rad and Norgard were both very clear about the fact that things will go slow at first, with Rad telling AdWeek that “it’s going to be a long time until [advertisements are] a consistent part of your experience.” They also told me that the engagement has been overwhelming and surprising. “We’re investing heavily in relevance, whether it’s leveraging the data we have with these signals our users give us, or using that data to do a better job of matching our users,” added Norgard.\\n\\n\\nWary of attack by activist hedge funds, IBM hires advisers to deal with restless investors: International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) is concerned about a possible attack by prominent activist hedge funds, and is working with two investment banks to formulate a defense plan, according to the people, who declined to be identified. When asked for comment, IBM said: \"IBM is continuing to execute on our strategy - making investments in growth areas such as analytics and cloud, reinventing our core franchises, and returning capital to shareholders. We are managing the company for the long term.\" The storied American technology giant, worth $157 billion today, has struggled to transform itself from a low-margin hardware maker into a cloud-based software and services company. When Virginia Rometty took over as chief executive at the start of 2012, Wall Street was hopeful that she would be able to kickstart growth. Analysts praised the former systems engineer for her strategic thinking in guiding IBM\\'s acquisition of PricewaterhouseCoopers Coopers Consulting in 2002. As revenues continued to decline year on year, however, some IBM investors began to lose confidence management, according to people familiar with the matter. Last year, IBM withdrew its long-term operating earnings target for 2015, and shares of Big Blue are now down about 25 percent from a March 2013 high. Some IBM shareholders are trying to persuade prominent activists to build positions in the company and come up with ways to boost value, people familiar with the matter said. Pershing Square and ValueAct Capital both looked at IBM in recent months, but passed on making a move, the people said. A spokesman for Pershing Square declined to comment. ValueAct did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Part of the activist funds\\' concern was that IBM, whose stock is trading at around $159, is too expensive and the company\\'s structural problems could not be fixed easily, according to several sources. Another reason, the sources said, is that some investors feel Rometty is doing a good job coping with a tough situation, so she does not fit the role of an underperforming CEO that many activists look for when they make a move.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",
      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\n\\nThe PayPal Mafia’s Golden Touch:\\xa0The ride-hailing app Uber, the apartment rental site Airbnb and other darlings of the next generation of Silicon Valley start-ups are reshaping the way people use the web. They are also changing expectations about just how much money private companies can raise while still staying out of the public markets. Known as the unicorns, these private technology companies are worth $1 billion or more, thanks to an influx of cash from venture capital firms, hedge funds, private equity firms and mutual funds. But alongside the Wall Street money flowing into these companies’ coffers, a familiar set of names is operating behind the scenes by advising, investing in and, in some cases, founding the unicorns. The PayPal Mafia — a nickname given a group of alumni of PayPal, the payments company that went public in 2002 and was acquired by eBay — has its hands in many, if not most, of today’s most valuable private tech companies. Their enduring influence, more than a decade after they made their first fortunes, speaks to the tightknit social fabric of Silicon Valley’s technology industry, and to the trust new entrepreneurs place in those who have succeeded before them. And now, the PayPal group’s close ties with the current crop of unicorns — a collection of some of the most valuable technology start-ups ever seen — suggest its influence is undiminished. The shared experience of PayPal alumni makes their advice — and money — particularly valuable to young entrepreneurs. An online payments provider founded in the 1990s, the company succeeded despite going public shortly after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, even as the economy was still reeling from both the attack and the collapse of the dot-com bubble. “PayPal was an extreme experience in survival against all odds, over and over again, with enormous and lasting success,” said Max Levchin, PayPal’s co-founder and chief technology officer. “Like veterans of an intense military campaign, we fall back on lessons learned, and relationships established in our early 20s.”\\n\\n\\neCommerce Search is Hot: intelligent search startup Tagalys and visual search startup Wazzat among winners of TechInAsia\\'s India startup contest: Ecommerce is booming in India, and this Chennai-based startup has an intelligent search tool for online retail sites. It helps drive revenues with product recommendations and analytics. Co-founder and CEO Antony Kattukaran said Tagalys already has five paying customers and three more have signed up for a trial. Currently bootstrapped, Tagalys charges clients based on usage. Right now, the gang of four at Tagalys is focused on product development. “We are offering Search as a Service. The market for this is as big as US$2 billion to $4 billion, and it’s growing,” Kattukaran said. The judges found the idea compelling enough as search is the biggest problem for every ecommerce company or website. But they also had some pointed questions. “Why would ecommerce companies outsource this core problem to somebody else? Why are you better at search compared to ecommerce companies who are your clients?” Takeshi Ebihara asked. Kattukaran was confident that the Tagalys technology with its results-based payment model would be a draw for the mid-sized ecommerce segment, which is the startup’s target base. While some of the biggest ecommerce sites would invest in their own tools, many others would welcome “search as a service” to keep up with tech. Tydy: A close contender was Tydy from Bangalore. It has developed a new content system tailored for mobile devices. It aims to take the pain out of trying to use Excel or Powerpoint on mobile. It puts together images, video, and text to create and share interactive mobile documents. The five-man Tydy team has already validated the product with over 250 users in India and is poised to scale up globally to serve the mobile generation. Currently in the enterprise space, Tydy charges its clients – small and medium-sized businesses – US$10 per month Wazzat: Next in line was a contender from Hyderabad. Wazzat is a cloud-based and mobile-friendly image recognition and visual search platform. “Our flagship product Wazzat Fashion is adding eyes to fashion ecommerce stores. Consumers can download our partner retailer’s app or visit their website to snap or select the photo of an apparel and instantly search for similar clothes. It also automatically learns the consumer’s style preferences and offers recommendations,” pitched Mauktik Kulkarni, co-founder of Wazzat Labs. The Wazzat Fashion widget is currently live on US-based retailer Target’s website. It is also in pilot stage on a couple of Indian ecommerce stores. It had a top three finish at last year’s MIT Global Startup Labs India accelerator program and recently graduated from the Target accelerator program. \\n\\n\\nDelta starts accepting payments via Alipay: Delta Air Lines Inc has become the first U.S. airline to accept payments via Alipay, the PayPal-like service run by an Alibaba Group Holding Ltd affiliate that is used by hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers. The airline has started taking payment for flight tickets on delta.com from Alipay\\'s 300 million-plus registered users, Alipay said in a statement on Wednesday. As the largest online payments service in a country where consumer finance remains less-than-fully developed, supporting Alipay - run by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial - should make it more convenient for would-be Chinese travelers to buy Delta tickets. That decision underscores the attractiveness to the industry of China, now the world\\'s largest source of outbound tourism after a decade of super-charged economic growth. The U.S. airline has said it wants to be the most Chinese-friendly American carrier.\\n\\n\\nFacebook’s Newest App Riff Lets Friends Add Clips To Collaborative Videos: Shoot a video of up to 20 seconds in Riff, and give it a title that instructs others what they should add to it like “Make A Funny Face” or “Birthday Wishes For Johnny” or “Adventures Of Mr. Banana.” Friends will see the video on Riff and get a notification inviting them to contribute, with each clip tacked on at the end. The contributors’ friends are then invited to add scenes, too. Facebook’s Riff Product Manager Josh Miller says “The potential pool of creative collaborators can grow exponentially from there, so a short video can become an inventive project between circles of friends you can share to Facebook or anywhere on the Internet.” Riff is the latest Facebook Creative Labs project following other experiments in app design like Paper, Slingshot, Mentions, Rooms and Groups. Like those, even if it doesn’t gain mass traction, it could teach Facebook what people want, in this case around video. If it does vie for growth, it could boost video creation on Facebook, but will have to compete with fellow collaborative video apps like JumpCam, Vyclone, MixBit, and Snapchat’s Our Stories feature. A few rules for Riffing: You can only shoot video in Riff, no uploads. You get a 3-2-1 countdown, and can approve your clip before posting, but there’s no multi-shot recording or editing features like those that have become standard on Instagram, Vine and other apps. There’s no liking or commenting in Riff. The goal is for people to contribute instead, so Riff is designed to make shooting unpolished, spontaneous video “feel inviting,” says Miller. Viewers can tap to fast-forward through boring clips, very similar to Snapchat Stories. Only friends of a video’s creator or collaborators can contribute to a video, making it expand virally through a social graph rather than going worldwide instantly. Your video could end up very public, though, as Riff will feature user video threads on its home page to inspire other users. View counts will help inspire people to reach for fame. When you post a Riff video to Facebook, all the contributors will automatically be tagged. The original creator can moderate their threads, tapping a ‘three dot’ button on their video to delete clips they don’t want. Anyone on Riff can report any specific clip as offensive, while Facebook users can report a whole video as containing something awful. While it’s available on iOS and Android worldwide today, it’s starting with only 15 languages, including English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese and Polish. Facebook has no plans to directly monetize Riff right now, but more videos uploaded to Facebook make it easier for it to show video ads that earn it money. The question now is whether Riff will see any traction. Facebook’s previous Creative Labs projects have largely flopped as consumer products. Riff certainly isn’t new. It’s basically a simpler clone of JumpCam, does what Everlapse did for photos, and offers a user-curated version of Snapchat’s editor-picked Our Stories.\\n\\n\\nWith Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, Samsung Tries to Regain Its Footing: Samsung’s internal code name for its latest top-of-the-line smartphones, the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, is “Project Zero,” signaling what Samsung calls “a return to fundamentals.” The code name also suggests that Samsung finally seems to understand the many criticisms that have long been leveled at its phones: the plastic hardware looked cheap, the most promoted features were mostly useless and the software was too complicated. Samsung, according to Samsung, has realized the errors of it ways. The realization was born out of necessity. Samsung’s market share and profits in the smartphone business have plummeted over the last year. The company, which is based in South Korea, is in the unenviable position of getting squeezed from the bottom by the affordable phones made by Chinese upstarts like Xiaomi and at the top by Apple’s powerhouse line of iPhones. The elegant new Galaxy phones, which went on sale in the United States last week, are aiming to pull Samsung out of that pickle. But while the phones are magnificent to look at, they are most likely not quite enough to fix what ails the company. Despite improved hardware, the S6 and S6 Edge still lack compelling software. Unlike Apple, Samsung has never managed to create a built-in suite of software and services to keep people hooked to its own phones. And there are few obvious ways for Samsung to address this glaring flaw. “You can argue that they’re in phase one of fixing their software, which is getting rid of a lot of the junk,” said Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst who anticipated Samsung’s recent troubles. “But we haven’t really seen phase two, which would be building its own stuff. We haven’t really seen much of that so far.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon unveiled a WiFi-connected gadget called the Amazon Dash Button that allows shoppers to refill orders of household staples with the press of a button. Coverage here, here, here, here, and here: Amazon.com on Tuesday unveiled its latest effort to bring more speed and convenience to online shopping: A WiFi-connected gadget called the Amazon Dash Button that allows shoppers to refill orders of household staples with the press of a button. The adhesive buttons are meant to be hung in convenient places around the home — so, for example, you might stick the Tide-branded button on the washing machine or the Huggies button in the nursery. When it\\'s time to restock that item, you push the button, and Amazon will soon ship it to your doorstep. At launch, the Dash button is only available for a limited number of household staples, such as Cottonelle toilet paper, Bounty paper towels and Glad trash bags. Using the Amazon smartphone app, consumers will configure the button to order exactly what they want — such as a four-pack of Gillette razors or a 12-pack. Dash buttons are free and are available now to Amazon Prime customers on an invitation-only basis. Amazon has been packing more and more perks into its Prime memberships, including same-day or even one-hour delivery and the ability to stream its exclusive TV programming. All of these efforts are aimed at more deeply entwining Amazon with its customers’ everyday lives, and in turn, boosting Amazon’s sales. Amazon has set up the Dash Button system so that it’s difficult to, say, end up with a shipment of 20 bottles of laundry detergent if your toddler discovers the bright orange Tide button and finds it really fun to press.  Once a Dash Button is pressed one time, it won’t be able to accept another order until the first one has been delivered.  You can also opt to receive notifications of Dash Button orders on your phone and can quickly cancel them, if necessary. The Dash button is a powered by the same technology as Amazon\\'s new Dash Replenishment Service. Appliance and device manufacturers can incorporate DRS technology into their products so that an Internet-connected coffee maker is able to order more beans, or a water filtration pitcher can order more filters. Gadget-makers can use DRS in two different ways: They can make it so that their products include a button that allows the consumer to choose when to place an order, or they can set it up so that orders are filled automatically when something is running low. The first DRS-powered devices will hit stores this fall.\\n\\n\\nJack Ma is in India again and met the Indian PM: Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba’s Chairman Jack Ma today met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as he came on a visit to India for the second time in just about four months. In his meeting with Modi here today, Ma discussed how Alibaba can help empower small businesses in India, the ecommerce major said without elaborating further. “Had a very good meeting with Jack Ma,” Modi tweeted.\\n\\n\\nSnapdeal buys RupeePower, a financial services marketplace, for an undisclosed sum: Snapdeal.com, has acquired a majority stake in Gurgaon-based digital financial products distribution startup RupeePower for an undisclosed amount, the company said in a statement. Post the acquisition, Snapdeal will offer its customers a financial services marketplace. The marketplace will include a wide range of financial services like personal loans, educational loans, credit cards, auto loans, home loans and extended warranties, etc. Financial services companies will be able to leverage Snapdeal’s nationwide reach across more than 5,000 towns and cities. Founded in 2011, RupeePower matches borrowers and lenders in the retail loans space for products like credit cards, personal loans, home loans, auto loans, and consumer loans. Customers are shown the best loan and card offers for comparison and matched with the bank’s criteria. The service is free for customers and the company gets paid by the financial institution upon loan disbursal. The company claims to have enabled Rs 1,500 crore of credit disbursal through its platform in the current financial year. Snapdeal.com is on a buying spree. Earlier this month, the company bought a minority stake in logistics firm QuickDel Logistics Pvt Ltd, which runs operations under the GoJavas brand. GoJavas was previously a part of Jabong, a lifestyle e-tailer incubated by Rocket Internet. Before that, it had acquired Indian designer wear and accessories e-tailer Exclusively.com (formerly Exclusively.in) for an undisclosed amount. In January 2015, Snapdeal picked up a stake in Smartprix Web Pvt Ltd, which runs online product and price comparison site Smartprix. The e-commerce firm is also expected to close the acquisition of online mobile recharge platform Freecharge for $450 million (Rs 2,800 crore). This is being regarded as the biggest deal in India’s consumer internet industry.\\n\\n\\nAfter a spectacular start, Apple Pay is beset with problems; survey finds 2/3 of users reported problems: Apple Inc.’s new mobile-payment system is failing to capture all of its potential business, according to a survey, with two-thirds of users reporting problems using the service at the checkout counter.While 66 percent of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus owners surveyed had signed up for Apple Pay, repeat usage is being hurt, the study by Phoenix Marketing International said. Almost half of users visited a store listed as an Apple Pay merchant only to find they couldn’t use the service because the location wasn’t actually accepting the system or wasn’t ready to do so, according to the survey, which drew about 3,000 respondents. “They’ve created demand, but it can’t be fulfilled,” Greg Weed, Phoenix’s director of card research, said in an interview. “To make it more difficult to use or to create any uncertainty in your customer base as to whether it’s going to work is just going to slow it down.” Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is relying on the new system to help expand Apple’s reach by offering new services for iPhone users. The biggest U.S. banks and credit-card networks are using Apple Pay to help accelerate U.S. adoption of mobile payments and keep in control of their transactions. At stake is a market that’s likely to process $67 billion worth of sales this year, according to Forrester Research. Apple declined to comment on the survey, which was conducted at the end of February, four months after Apple Pay was introduced. Apple Pay, which uses short-range wireless signals known as near-field communication, essentially turns an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus into a digital wallet. The system works only at stores that have upgraded their cash registers to accept chip-embedded credit cards. It’s now supported by 2,500 banks in the U.S. and about 700,000 locations accept it, Cook said this month. “It’s gotten off to the most amazing start,” Cook said at an event to unveil features of the company’s Apple Watch. Samsung Electronics Co. earlier this month unveiled its own mobile-transaction system, Samsung Pay, which will be available in the third quarter in the U.S. and South Korea. The technology works at checkout terminals that use older, magnetic-stripe technology, as well as NFC. Google Inc., which already has a mobile wallet, has also said it plans to expand in the business and is working on a new service called Android Pay. The average Apple Pay user made 2.6 in-store transactions using the system in its first four months, the survey by Rhinebeck, New York-based Phoenix found. Almost half used it to purchase something inside an Apple store, while almost a third used it at Macy’s Inc. Thirty-six percent of Apple Pay customers used it at McDonald’s Corp. The majority of people who used Apple Pay said they did so because it was faster than a traditional credit card. Almost 60 percent they were using it because “it’s new, stylish or cool,” while 58 percent said they thought it was safer than a normal credit card. About half of users said it was good for medium-sized purchases. Of the problems that occurred at merchants, 48 percent of those surveyed said it took too long to record the transaction, while 42 percent said the cashier was unfamiliar with Apple Pay and unable to help. Other complaints included transactions that incorrectly posted, or were counted twice. The complaints are just some of the challenges Apple faces as it brings out a new payment system. Apple Pay has also been hit by fraud. Some banks have made changes in how they activate customers’ credit-card accounts after reports that criminals were typing stolen credit-card numbers into Apple Pay and trying to make purchases with their iPhones. Some issuers have found that up to 8 percent of Apple Pay transactions were fraudulent, compared with 0.1 percent on traditional payments cards, said Julie Conroy, an analyst at Aite Group.\\n\\n\\nUbiquity of Malware: Google Says 5% Of Visitors To Its Sites Have Ad Injectors Installed: According to a study Google conducted with researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, 5 percent of people visiting Google’s sites and services now have at least one ad injector installed. When it comes to malware, ad injectors may seem relatively benevolent at first. They put an ad on your Google Search page that didn’t belong there, for example. That’s annoying, but doesn’t seem dangerous. But ad injection was pretty much what Lenovo’s Superfish was doing and that created plenty of security issues for users. Indeed, the research, which is based on the analysis of 100 million pageviews across Google’s sites from Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer, classified about a third of these injectors as “outright malware.” Given that these kinds of ad injectors are often bundles with legitimate software — and desktop developers and download sites often see them as a relatively easy way to make a bit of extra money with their installers and download wrappers — it’s easy enough to install one of them inadvertently. Google and the Berkeley researchers found that ad injectors are now available on all major platforms and browsers. Out of those 5 percent of users that have at least one installed, one-third actually had four of them running simultaneously and half were running two. Clearly, there is a group of users that is a bit more prone to catching one of these than others Google says it has already banned 192 Chrome extensions that affected 14 million users based on this research and it is now using the same techniques the researchers used to scan all new and updated extensions in the Chrome Web Store. Google’s advertising and browser extension policies pretty much ban deceptive ad injectors — as do most other ad networks — but most of the companies that build them aren’t exactly about following the rules. It’s also worth noting that ad networks often also don’t know that their ads are being used in this way. Unless Google and other browser and advertising vendors find a technical solution to this problem, chances are it’ll never fully go away.\\n\\n\\nGoDaddy Said to Price I.P.O. Above Expected Range: Nearly four years ago, GoDaddy was an Internet registration company with a history of risqué advertising. Now, as it prepares for new life on the public stock markets, the company is eager to let everyone know that it does a lot more than register website addresses — and doesn’t rely on racy commercials with scantily clad spokeswomen, either. That new vision of GoDaddy appeared to resonate with investors. The company raised $440 million after pricing its initial public offering at $20 a share late Tuesday, above its expected range of $17 to $19 a share, according to a person close to the transaction. At that price, the company has a market value of just more than $3 billion. Under the ownership of the investment firms that bought the company in 2011 for about $2.25 billion — Silver Lake, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Technology Crossover Ventures — GoDaddy has sought to transcend its long-established roots and promote itself as the guide to the Internet for small business. That is a much bigger vision than the one the company had when it was founded in 1997 by Bob Parsons as a way for customers to register domain names and host websites. Eventually, it became the biggest Internet registrar, thanks in large part to Mr. Parsons’s unabashedly attention-seeking advertising, which frequently revolved around spokeswomen like the racecar driver Danica Patrick. Among GoDaddy’s most familiar tactics was creating versions of Super Bowl commercials that would never be shown on broadcast television. After the company’s new owners took over, the business tried to change its tone along with its business model. The private equity firms brought in Blake Irving, a former chief product officer at Yahoo, to help transform GoDaddy into what it described in its I.P.O. prospectus as “a leading technology provider to small businesses.” Internet site registration remains GoDaddy’s biggest source of revenue, accounting for just more than half of its sales last year. According to the prospectus, the company now oversees 59 million domains, or about 21 percent of those worldwide. Website hosting services and tools, a natural complement to the domain business, made up 39 percent of its bookings last year. The company believes it still has room to grow in its main market. A study it commissioned found that more than 50 percent of American small businesses did not have a website as of early 2013. But GoDaddy has also become one of the biggest resellers of Microsoft’s Office 365 suite of productivity and email services, with that operation making up about 10 percent of its sales last year. GoDaddy has also expanded abroad, going from one English-language website to an array of offerings in 37 countries and 17 languages. About one-quarter of its revenue now comes from international business. Over all, the company’s sales have climbed consistently in the last three years, up to nearly $1.4 billion in 2014. It lost $143.3 million during that period, according to generally accepted accounting principles, though the company points to what it calls adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which strips out certain accounting charges. Using that measurement, GoDaddy earned $271.5 million.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba Signs Distribution Deal With BMG, Its First Music Partner Outside Of Asia: (more here) In a bid to increase its online entertainment offerings, Alibaba has struck an agreement with music publisher BMG, which gives it access to over 2.5 million tracks. The partnership is notable because it represents the first time Alibaba’s digital entertainment unit has signed with a music partner outside of Asia. The business already has agreements with Taiwanese music companies Rock Records and HIM International Music. The deal gives Alibaba access to BMG’s catalog, which includes tracks from Bruno Mars, the Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, and Kylie Minogue. Music will be made available to consumers through streaming apps Xiami and TTPod, both of which are operated by Alibaba’s digital entertainment business. It’s important to remember that Alibaba is more than just an e-commerce company. It is also one of China’s biggest mobile Internet players, competing head-to-head with Tencent, which has already struck similar arrangements with Warner Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment. Alibaba’s growth plans include selling other online services to the huge user base it has grown by operating China’s top e-commerce platforms and online payment service Alipay. Streaming music is a potential growth market for Chinese Internet companies, but only if they succeed in dealing with piracy. According to the Financial Times, China accounted for less than one percent of the $15 billion in global revenues made in 2013 by record companies, in part because pirated tracks are easy to obtain. The government, however, has begun to crackdown on copyright infringement, and deals like the ones Alibaba and Tencent have struck with BMG, Warner Music Group, and Sony Music Entertainment give music publishers more power over their IP in China. In a statement, Alibaba said “the agreement will not only significantly boost earnings by BMG artists and writers from the world’s most populous nation, but also give them a powerful ally in hleping grow the legitimate music market in China.” This means that Alibaba will help BMG keep an eye on pirated music and work with them to take legal action against services that are using tracks that violate BMG’s copyright.\\n\\n\\nUS Health Regulator FDA \\'Taking a Very Light Touch\\' on Regulating the Apple Watch: Bakul Patel, who oversees the new wave of consumer-focused health products at the Food and Drug Administration, said most wearable gadgets such as the soon-to-be-released Apple Watch and health-focused applications for smartphones have a way to go before warranting close scrutiny from the agency. \"We are taking a very light touch, an almost hands-off approach,\" Patel, the FDA\\'s associate director for digital health, said in an interview. \"If you have technology that\\'s going to motivate a person to stay healthy, that\\'s not something we want to be engaged in.\" The FDA is mapping out its role at a time when health care and consumer technology are blending. Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and other companies are building products loaded with sensors that have the potential to eventually gather all sorts of information about blood pressure, body temperature, glucose levels, hydration, oxygen levels and outside air conditions. Software algorithms are being developed that gather different information about a person\\'s health to provide a diagnosis of potential illness that backers say may eventually be more accurate than a doctor. Some products raised flags with regulators after they\\'ve reached the market. In February, the Federal Trade Commission cracked down on some smartphone apps for dubiously claiming to diagnose melanoma based on an uploaded picture. Meanwhile, the U.S. Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights is responsible for oversight of the security of patient-health data collected by electronic devices, a separate issue that is being closely watched by privacy advocates. \"I worry that there are going to be companies that are skirting the rules,\" Gandhi said. \"We have to see the enforcement, otherwise it creates a very uneven playing field between companies that are acting ethically and those that aren\\'t.\" Patel said Apple and Google Inc. and other corporations should play a role in screening applications to be sure health-software developers aren\\'t over-promising the benefits of their products. Both companies have visited FDA headquarters in Maryland to discuss their health initiatives, he said.\\n\\n\\nIndia Startup Action: 5 startups pass out of Target’s accelerator in India; include a visual search engine, in-store location targeting plays: Five startups have just completed a four-month incubation program at US-based retailer Target’s accelerator in Bangalore. This is the second batch to graduate from the accelerator, which focuses on new ideas in retail. This batch of startups had innovators in omnichannel, data, digital marketing, mobile, and supply chain. Here’s a quick look at the five fresh Target graduates: Wazzat: Wazzat is a visual search engine. Its widget has both mobile and web APIs which ecommerce sites can easily integrate. The widget helps find visually similar products. During the incubation, it tested its “find similar” tool with apparel and shoes on the Target site. Whodat: Whodat makes mobile augmented reality apps for brands to help customers visualize their products. For example, it piloted an app at the accelerator for people to see how Target’s dinnerware would look in their homes. Visarity: Visarity enables interactive 3D experiences on both mobile and web, for apps as well as ads. It has wide applications in product demos, navigation maps, and gaming. Target used the Visarity platform to build a game experience for its media network. Torch: Torch is a wireless sensor built by Antarix Labs to monitor smartphone activity inside a store. In this way, it aims to provide offline retailers with the kind of analytics on customers that online retailers now take for granted. Synapse: This is another offline play. The Synapse app recognizes customers when they walk into a store and sends context-aware notifications to the lockscreens of their mobile phones. At Target, it piloted relevant push offers for customers on Android lockscreens.\\n\\n\\nSnapchat\\'s ad offerings present a conundrum for marketers: enormous engagement, but little data, targeting: Brands salivating over Snapchat as an engaging influencer marketing tool are all too often put off by costly campaigns and inconclusive results. But given the messaging app is insanely popular with millennials, agencies and brands are creating workarounds, or at the very least complementing Snapchat campaigns much as they did in the early days of Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook. Snapchat hosts compilation videos shared from special events and locations via its Our, Live and Local Stories channels. There also are Discover channels with media companies like Vice and Comedy Central posting content. The app splits revenue with the media companies for ads on Discover channels, and those sponsorships can cost as much as $75,000 a day, say marketing execs. In other cases, brands like McDonald\\'s cough up as much as $750,000 for daily official sponsorships. The content and ads disappear within 24 hours, ready for fresh material. That element vexes a number of marketers. Moreover, marketers remain skeptical of Snapchat given there\\'s no way to accurately direct ads to specific audiences and no easy way to figure out whether they actually worked. One digital ad executive who recently saw Snapchat\\'s sales pitch said, \"It was not impressive because there\\'s no way to target ads.\" \"Snapchat is very limited as far as the data it makes available,\" said Justin Rezvani, CEO of theAmplify, an Instagram-focused shop that recently branched out with Snapchat. \"Our focus is to track sentiment and conversations on alternative platforms, like Instagram.\" Rezvani said it\\'s hard to measure basics like whether users are watching Snapchat videos all the way through. However, most signs point to Snapchat users being super engaged with the content. The Stories channels have attracted more than 1 billion views on active days, according to social shops contacted and figures reported by Snapchat. The content is so transitive that consumers cherish it more, Cicero said. \"There\\'s nothing to compare it to, so in general advertisers are hesitant,\" he said. \"But the ones that take advantage now obviously will be more successful. They understand the mindset shift.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo Grow in the Data Center Market, Intel Is Said to Be in Talks to Acquire Chipmaker Altera: Intel Corp. is in talks to acquire Altera Corp., people with knowledge of the matter said, as the world’s largest chipmaker searches for growth beyond a moribund personal-computer market. The people asked not to be identified discussing private information. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on the discussions. Altera shares jumped 28 percent to $44.39 at the close in New York, giving the company a valuation of about $13.4 billion. Intel rose 6.4 percent to $32. Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for Santa Clara, California-based Intel, and Sue Martenson, a spokeswoman for San Jose, California-based Altera, declined to comment. Intel is on the hunt for growth as it faces a slowdown in the market for PCs that forced a $1 billion cut in its first-quarter sales forecast earlier this month. Sales in the worldwide PC market will shrink 4.9 percent this year, IDC said, as consumers around the world spend more on mobile devices typically based on processors using designs from Intel rivals such as Qualcomm Inc. That decline comes on top of heavy losses in Intel’s mobile division. The group reported an operating loss of $4.21 billion for 2014. A bright spot for Intel is the data-center group, where profits soared to $7.28 billion on sales of $14.4 billion in 2014. The company benefited from a boom in the amount of data being generated and held in computing centers around the world. Altera makes a broad range of low-power programmable semiconductors, which are used in small embedded devices and computer servers for big data centers. In buying Altera, Intel could expand into markets for automotive, industrial and communication applications, while cementing its lead in data centers, said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. Hees has a neutral rating on the stock. “This would be a significant move for Intel, it would be a significant change in strategy,” she said. “They need diversification beyond the PC market. Data center has been a tremendous source of strength. Mobile has been a tremendous financial drain. Intel and Altera announced a manufacturing partnership in February 2013, agreeing that Altera chips would be made in Intel’s cutting-edge plants. That deal was extended in March last year when the companies agreed to do more detailed work together on chip packaging and design. An acquisition of Altera would help Intel make further inroads into corporate data centers and reduce its dependence on a PC market pressured by the rise of mobile computing, according to Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. who has the equivalent of a sell rating on Intel’s stock. “It makes sense that they would potentially be looking for other opportunities to grow the other part of the business,” Rasgon said. “There are synergies, say, in Intel’s data-center business.” Intel could use Altera’s technology to create new processors that pair its traditional products with low-power communications chips, wrote Jefferies Group LLC in a note circulated after the market close on Friday. That would let the company “offer cloud-service providers like Google, Amazon and Facebook the ability to pull communication processing from expensive networking equipment into much lower-cost server blades, effectively enabling Intel to take share in the data-center networking-equipment market,” Jefferies wrote. Altera reported operating income of $543.4 million on sales of $1.93 billion in 2014, compared with Intel’s full-year revenue of $55.9 billion.\\n\\n\\nGitHub has been battling a DoS attack for days - alleged source of attack: China: U.S. coding site GitHub said on Sunday that it was deflecting most of the traffic from a days-long cyber attack that had caused intermittent outages for the social coding site, with the Wall Street Journal citing China as the source of the attack. \"Eighty-seven hours in, our mitigation is deflecting most attack traffic. We\\'re aware of intermittent issues and continue to adapt our response,\" a tweet from the GitHub Status account said. The attack took the form of a flood of traffic, known as a distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attack. Those kinds of attacks are among the most common on the Internet. The Wall Street Journal reported that the flood of Internet traffic to GitHub came from Chinese search engine Baidu Inc, targeting two GitHub pages that linked to copies of sites that are banned in China. On its blog, GitHub said that the attack began early on Thursday \"and involves a wide combination of attack vectors.\" \"These include every vector we\\'ve seen in previous attacks as well as some sophisticated new techniques that use the web browsers of unsuspecting, uninvolved people to flood github.com with high levels of traffic,\" the blog post continued. \"Based on reports we\\'ve received, we believe the intent of this attack is to convince us to remove a specific class of content.\" GitHub supplies social coding tools for developers and calls itself the world\\'s largest code host. A Beijing-based Baidu spokesman said the company had conducted a thorough investigation and found that it was neither a security problem on Baidu\\'s side nor a hacking attack. \"We have notified other security organizations and are working to get to the bottom of this,\" the spokesman said.\\n\\n\\nIndia\\'s capital markets regulator Sebi on listing norms for start-ups: SEBI is likely to put out a discussion paper on the listing norms for start-ups next week. Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) Chairman U K Sinha today met an eight-member team from start-up think-tank iSpirt Foundation here to discuss the way forward for start-ups to raise funds from the primary markets. “Sebi would put out a discussion paper next week suggesting a series of improvements. The first draft guidelines are expected by the end of June,” iSpirt Foundation co-founder and governing council member Sharad Sharma told PTI. The think-tank has been in touch with Sebi since mid-December to facilitate the rapidly burgeoning start-up space to go public and raise funds. “This will stop the exodus of start-ups that choose to list on international markets currently,” Sharma said. He, however, declined to comment on the contents of the discussion paper. At the last meeting with Sebi on December 19 last year, the industry had sought regulatory intervention in easing the existing regulations and guidelines which make it difficult for companies to get right investors and advisors. Another suggestion was to make the listing process faster and easier so that investors could exit. Minutes of the past meeting with Sebi posted on the thinktank’s website say the Sebi chairman had indicated that the regulator was exploring putting in place a framework for crowd-funding which will provide a much-needed new mode of financing for start-ups and SME sector and increase flow of credit to SMEs and other users in the real economy. In this mode, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups will be able to raise funds at a lower cost of capital without going through rigorous procedures.\\n\\n\\nBlackBerry Reports $28 Million Profit in 4th Quarter - business no longer on brink of collapse, but future still unclear: John S. Chen, executive chairman of the ailing smartphone maker BlackBerry, was again asking for patience on Friday after the company produced a surprise, but slim, profit while also posting an unexpected drop in revenue. The $28 million profit in BlackBerry’s fourth quarter was mainly thanks to a patent sale and tax recovery. The company lost $106 million on an operating basis. For the entire year, the company lost $304 million on revenue of $3.3 billion. Despite the introduction of two new phones and a push by the company to sell software that allows businesses and governments to manage all of their employees’ mobile phones regardless of their brand, fourth-quarter revenue was $660 million, down from $793 million in the previous quarter. Analysts had expected revenue of about $792 million. The revenue drop suggests that the company has yet to revive its phone business, said Brian Colello, an analyst at the firm Morningstar. During the period, BlackBerry offered two new phones: the Classic, which restored features found on older BlackBerrys, and the Passport, which has an unusual square screen. They were aimed at BlackBerry’s traditional customers, like people in the financial industry. Neither has sold well. There was one bright spot. ITG Investment Research reported that retail data it collected in BlackBerry’s home market in Canada showed that BlackBerry sales at Rogers Communications, the country’s largest wireless carrier, rose by 27 percent in the final quarter of last year compared with the third quarter. Sales at Bell Canada were up 12 percent, but BlackBerry sales fell by 13 percent at Telus, the other large carrier in Canada. ITG added that “the solid quarterly trends seen at Canadian carriers may not be representative of global sales trends.” BlackBerry’s software business rose by 24 percent over the previous quarter and 20 percent over the same period a year earlier. But Mr. Chen told analysts that an older version of the company’s mobile device management software, which is more oriented toward BlackBerrys, was outselling the new version, which the company is promoting heavily. Although BlackBerry no longer appears to be on the brink of collapse, Mr. Colello said it was still unclear if Mr. Chen could now make his company grow while maintaining profitability. “The entire business is very uncertain at this point,” he said.\\n\\n\\nFounder of mobile buying app Fetch: \"Mobile Messaging Conjures A Commerce Platform\" This week brought two announcements that reflect a seismic shift in the future of mobile messaging: 600 million users of Facebook Messenger will soon be able to order food, buy products and text directly with businesses; and meanwhile, Magic is raising an astonishing $12 million from Sequoia to allow you to order any on-demand service simply by sending a text message. America is finally discovering what Asia has known for years: mobile messaging is a commerce platform. These developments herald what Chris Messina recently described as a new trend towards “conversational commerce,” in which users will be able to shed the need for countless apps from different companies in favor a simple mobile messaging interface. “Conversational Commerce is about delivering convenience, personalization, and decision support while people are on the go, with only partial attention to spare,” Messina says. Put more simply: we all text more than ever, so why not expand texting’s potential to sending payments, buying products, ordering on-demand services, paying bills, and more? Facebook and Sequoia are not alone in making a big bet that Conversational Commerce marks the next stage of texting’s evolution. We’re in the midst of a veritable messaging gold rush. Earlier this month, Alibaba poured $200 million into SnapChat, which now lets you send money to a friend or buy a product using their newly-launched SnapCash. This follows Alibaba’s $215 million investment in Tango last year. Rakuten recently snapped up Viber for $900 million with an eye towards integrating mobile commerce into the messaging app. Other start-ups in the “conversational commerce” space include Scratch and BRANDiD, which provide curated shopping recommendations; and Native, whose personal travel assistant service allows you to book flights and hotels by sending a text. Path Talk was the first messaging app to allow users to message directly with businesses, making restaurant reservations as easy as sending an SMS. The inevitable evolution of messaging apps like Facebook Messenger and SnapChat into commerce platforms will change the way we think about mobile commerce. It won’t be long until you’ll be texting your food order to DoorDash, paying bills by SMS, or firing off a quick Facebook Message to send flowers to your loved one. Magic may not be able to be deliver on their promise of bringing a tiger to your front door, but it’s clear that mobile messaging is about to get a whole lot more powerful.\\n\\n\\nFor Hardware Makers, Sharing Their Secrets Is Now Part of the Business Plan: Facebook showed plans last week for drone aircraft that beam lasers conveying high-speed data to remote parts of the world. As powerful as that sounds, Facebook already has something that could be even more potent: a huge sharing of its once-proprietary information, the kind of thing that would bring a traditional Silicon Valley patent lawyer to tears. Facebook is not alone. Technology for big computers, electric cars and high-technology microcontrollers to operate things like power tools and engines is now given away. These ideas used to be valued at hundreds of millions of dollars. To the new generation of technologists, however, moving projects and data fast overrides the value of making everything in secret. “You now don’t need a lot of people or a lot of capital to manufacture a prototype,” said Jay Parikh, vice president for connectivity at Facebook. “The entire world is going to accelerate its technology development.” Facebook has already shared designs for data storage, computer servers and rack designs, among other hardware, Mr. Parikh said, and has seen rapid improvements as a result. Rather than just building and testing a handful of designs, Facebook gets to see dozens of variations that individuals and companies manufacture inexpensively. They often contract with prototype makers over marketplaces like the Chinese e-commerce site Alibaba, or they may even use three-dimensional printers. When companies do make hardware free, Mr. Dougherty said, it is not usually altruistic. “It can create competition for your enemy without spending money on a new product,” he said. He noted that IBM went into open-source software in the 1990s, and Microsoft suffered. Sometimes companies want to kick-start business. Facebook’s open designs have enabled commercial relationships that lower its supply costs as well as speed innovation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKiranaNow: Amazon launches hyperlocal express delivery service linking neighbourhood kirana stores to consumers: Amazon, which runs an online marketplace in India, has launched an express delivery platform in partnership with mom-and-pop stores called ‘KiranaNow’. It has launched the service in Bangalore on a pilot run before taking it to other cities in the country. Notably this is an India-specific platform. In most other international markets, Amazon itself is the prime seller (though it also has other vendors) and operates like a conventional inventory-based e-com venture, a model it itself spread around the world. “With this service we want to provide to our customers an instant and convenient access to their ecosystem of stores for their everyday needs right from their mobile phone. And likewise empower the Kirana stores with tools and technology to transform their growth in the digital economy,” an Amazon India spokesperson told Techcircle.in. The deliveries will be done via Amazon’s own logistics unit Amazon Transportation Service Private Limited, besides delivery boys of kirana stores themselves as well as third party vendors. Last year, Amazon had also roped in kirana stores or neighbourhood mom-and-pop retail stores to serve as pick-up and delivery points for products for its customer orders. In the US, Amazon offers such pick-up options as an alternative to home delivery through lockers placed in public areas. Amazon spokesperson added that this independent pilot project it ran with kirana stores last year has since scaled to over 500 outlets across 20+ cities. Meanwhile, the KiranaNow service has been launched only on the mobile browser platform and claims to deliver orders within two-four hours. KiranaNow has been added to ‘Shop by Department’ on Amazon.in’s mobile browser version. When chosen, the user is led to a page with various categories like daily cooking essentials, drinks and beverages, personal care, household supplies, etc. There is an option to sign up with Kirana Now. Last we checked it threw a message saying: ‘Sorry something went wrong. We are working on fixing it’. The products were also showing as currently unavailable. To be fair, it is just the beginning and the firm says it is currently offering the service to select pincodes in Bangalore. Moreover, this is available only between 9AM and 6PM. Notably, this pitches Amazon against e-grocers like BigBasket, ZopNow and Godrej Nature’s Basket (which recently acquired EkStop) as also express delivery service providers such as Grofers, which essentially picks products from local vendors to supply to consumers.\\n\\n\\n\\nUS R&D spending surges 6.7% Y/Y, with largest gain since 1996; software spend up 10% - both leading indicators of productivity: Corporate spending on research and development rose 6.7 percent in 2014, almost twice the previous year’s gain and the biggest advance since 1996, according to Commerce Department data. The pickup was capped by a 14 percent fourth-quarter surge that signals additional increases are on the way. The spending could extend the momentum of an era of growth-inducing innovation that produced smartphones and tablet computers, 3-D printers, cloud software that delivers services via the Internet and hydraulic fracturing that is making the U.S. more energy self-sufficient. Combined with what’s still on the drawing board, such initiatives raise the odds productivity will rebound, boosting the standard of living. “CEOs wouldn’t be paying all these researchers -- which is where the R&D budget primarily flows to -- unless they thought that there was something really interesting going on,” Jason Cummins, chief U.S. economist and head of research in Washington for hedge fund Brevan Howard Inc. “R&D surges like this sow the portents of better productivity growth three, five, 10 years later.” The U.S. could benefit from such a boost. Employee output per hour has climbed 0.7 percent a year on average since 2011, compared with gains of 2.5 percent from 1990 through 2005, a period encompassing what some economists have called a “productivity miracle.” The pickup in R&D spending last year was paced by well-known names, as 18 companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index boosted such investment by 25 percent or more from 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The list includes drug-makers such as Pfizer Inc., travel-booking firms Priceline Group Inc. and TripAdvisor Inc., and Apple Inc. and Google Inc. Pharmaceutical companies were some of the biggest spenders on R&D in 2012, running up a $48.1 billion tab, according to the latest data from a survey by the National Science Foundation. The information industry -- including publishing, telecommunications and data processing -- shelled out $46.8 billion, while transportation-equipment makers spent about $42.3 billion. The U.S. is a leader in R&D spending in part because some 70 percent of venture capital money is based here, said Subramanian. This is “another good barometer of how innovation-oriented a particular region is,” and shows that America is “hyper-focused” on that investment, even if some of the venture capital money ends up in foreign companies, she said. The benefits of increased spending on R&D also are likely to help spur sluggish wage growth, Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics Inc. in West Chester, Pennsylvania, wrote in a March 19 research note. More investment in intellectual property -- which includes software and entertainment in addition to R&D -- should prompt acceleration in incomes in the next couple years, he wrote. Spending on computer software, which is tallied separately from the government’s R&D category, also has shown a revival. It increased at a 10.1 percent pace in the fourth quarter, its best gain since 2011.\\n\\n\\nLyft Adds Profiles to Make Ride Sharing More Personalized: Unlike Uber, the giant ride-hailing start-up with its powerful name and sleek, black-and-silver branding, Lyft has gone for a warmer, fuzzier exterior. Lyft drivers eschew fit and finish for large, pink dashboard mustaches to identify themselves. The company encourages lively conversation between passengers and drivers. It is, to some degree, a kinder, gentler and perhaps more convivial form of taking an Uber car. Expect more of the same in the future. On Thursday, Lyft plans to add user profiles for drivers and passengers to its app, essentially adding another personal touch to the act of taking a ride somewhere. The additions are not extreme. People are asked to provide their hometown, music tastes or other things about themselves that may be interesting topics of conversation. If a user has connected their Facebook account, the Lyft app can show if drivers and passengers have mutual friends in common. “It’s our first step on the road map to personalizing that in-car experience,” said Tali Rapaport, vice president of product at Lyft, who was tasked with creating the profiles. The feature is entirely optional, and users aren’t forced to turn it on. Part of the exercise is certainly branding. Lyft recently brought on Kira Wampler, a former executive at Trulia, to be its chief marketing officer. Since joining in December, Ms. Wampler has helped revamp Lyft’s image, swapping the furry mustaches that Lyft drivers stuck to their cars with the “glowstache,” a luminescent replica that sits atop a driver’s dashboard so that passengers can spot their rides. But profiles speak to Lyft’s broad vision of the company. Lyft is pushing Line, its car pool product, as the future of the company, one where there’s a “butt in every seat,” as Ms. Rapaport put it. Instead of hailing a personal car, calling a Lyft Line offers passengers a discount for picking up one or two more people who are traveling along a similar route. As they travel the route, passengers are dropped off at different points along the way. Passengers save money and, in theory, net income goes up for both Lyft and the driver. Lyft’s ideal version of the future is to have as many people using Lyft Line as possible, cutting down on the number of cars on the road. So an addition like user profiles, however small, may make the experience of traveling by car pool more enjoyable. Topics of conversation are easily available, for instance, or a driver may play a track from a passenger’s favorite band. “When you build a product that touches millions of people, it should be human, not transactional,” said John Zimmer, co-founder and president of Lyft.\\n\\n\\nLate to streaming - Apple finally developing streaming music service to rival Spotify: In what would be the biggest change to its music strategy in years, Apple is pressing ahead with a sweeping overhaul of its digital music services that would allow the company to compete directly with streaming upstarts like Spotify. Almost a year after agreeing to pay $3 billion for Beats, the maker of hip headphones and a streaming music service, Apple is working with Beats engineers and executives to introduce its own subscription streaming service. The company is also planning an enhanced iTunes Radio that may be tailored to listeners in regional markets, and, if Apple gets what it wants, more splashy new albums that will be on iTunes before they are available anywhere else, according to people briefed on the company’s plans. In a sign of how important Beats is in reshaping Apple’s digital music, the company has made a musician a point man for overhauling the iPhone’s music app to include the streaming music service, as opposed to an engineer. Trent Reznor, the Nine Inch Nails frontman who was the chief creative officer for Beats, is playing a major role in redesigning the music app, according to two Apple employees familiar with the product, who spoke on the condition they not be named because the plans are private. Perhaps most telling for Apple is what its new streaming service will not have: a lower price than rival services. According to several music executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks are private, Apple recently tried but failed to persuade record labels to agree to lower licensing costs that would have let Apple sell subscriptions to its streaming service for $8 a month — a discount from the $10 that has become standard for services like Spotify, Rhapsody and Rdio. That $2 markdown may be small, but Apple’s failure to secure it reflects a shift in the company’s relationship with the music industry. While Apple once enjoyed enormous negotiating power as the dominant force in digital music — an area it helped pioneer more than a decade ago with music downloads — it now faces an array of new competitors and finds itself in the position of needing to modernize its offerings to catch up to the streaming revolution. That has weakened Apple’s leverage — and the labels could not be happier about it. Apple’s turn toward streaming is a matter of necessity, as listeners increasingly shift from music downloads to streaming. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, downloads generated $2.6 billion in revenue in 2014, down 8.5 percent from the year before. Streaming made $1.87 billion last year, and overtook CD sales for the first time. As the biggest retailer of music, Apple remains a crucial marketing partner for the music industry. Yet its absence from streaming has let others get a head start. Spotify, which started in Sweden in 2008 and came to the United States in 2011, said in January that it has 15 million paying subscribers around the world, as well as 45 million more who listen free, with advertising. (Apple’s iTunes has more than 800 million customer accounts.)\\n\\n\\nQuestions arise as bankrupt RadioShack seeks to sell trove of customer data. After filing for bankruptcy in early February, RadioShack is currently making its way through the painful process of \\xa0figuring out how creditors will be paid back -- auctioning off real estate and trademarks. Also on the list is more than 13 million e-mail addresses and 65 million customer names and physical addresses -- as well as potential information about customers shopping habits. How much that data could be worth to a buyer is still unclear, but the proposed sale is drawing protests from consumer advocates and raising potentially disturbing questions about how data about shoppers is handled. In the Internet Age, people leave a near constant trail of digital bread crumbs about their lives. And it\\'s clear that data has value: The entire online advertising industry is based on collecting it. But what happens if a company that has amassed a huge trove of data on nearly every aspect of a person\\'s life gets sold off for parts? Radio Shack declined to comment about its bankruptcy\\'s process. The company was a pioneer in collecting customer data, said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \"Radio Shack was the first company that routinely asked for phone numbers. The privacy policy was critical to maintain consumer confidence,\" he said. And in its privacy policy, RadioShack told customers that it wouldn\\'t sell or rent their personally identifiable information to third parties -- which should make this a pretty clear issue, Rotenberg said. But as Bloomberg News noted, a Web site for Hilco Streambank, a company serving as an intermediary for RadioShack in the bankruptcy process, listed the retailer\\'s \"customer databases\" as among the assets for sale. Hedge fund and RadioShack creditor Standard General won an auction for the company\\'s assets, according to Bloomberg. But the deal must still be approved by a bankruptcy court in Delaware and is facing several challenges. Back in 2000, after the dot-com bubble burst, the FTC sued to stop Toysmart.com from selling off customer data in violation of its privacy policy. In that case, the FTC said that data in question included names, addresses, billing information, shopping preferences and family profiles, \\xa0including the names and birth dates of children. The data was eventually destroyed. The FTC has also sent letters about proposed data sales in the bankruptcies of other companies, including Borders, XY Magazine, and ConnectEDU.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba\\'s money-market fund ended 2014 with $93B in AUM, but its phase of explosive growth might be over: Ant Financial, Alibaba’s affiliated financial branch, revealed a few benchmark numbers for Yu’ebao, the company’s consumer-facing money-market fund. By the end of 2014, Yu’ebao’s user count hit 185 million, up more than four times the previous year’s count of 43 million. The fund’s worth in assets reached RMB 578.93 billion (about US$93 billion) by the year’s end, marking a 200 percent annual increase. Ant financial also claims that Yu’ebao’s funds generated RMB 24 billion (about US$3.8 billion) in value by year’s end, amounting to RMB 139 per person. While these numbers appear massive from a birds-eye view, not all is peachy keen for Yu’ebao. The fund’s size shrunk to about US$87 million last autumn, and while these latest numbers appear to show a rebound, its days of rocket growth seem to be over. Yu’ebao is the shell and banner for a money market fund run by Tianhong Asset Management. Alibaba’s Ant Financial purchased a majority stake in Tianhong in late 2013 for a reported US$192 million. Yu’ebao is accessible directly in Alipay Wallet, the mobile app for Alipay, Alibaba’s third-party payment software. Yu’ebao marks Alibaba founder Jack Ma’s attempt to enter consumer banking. In the past, the ecommerce mogul has been vocal about his disdain for China’s banking industry, wherein banks typically give consumers low interest rates for opening savings accounts. China’s tech giants don’t like to get one-upped, and other leading internet firms have also opened money-market funds similar to Yu’ebao. Tencent operates Licaitong, an analogous money market fund, and recently opened what has been described as China’s first “internet bank.” Baidu also has its hat in the ring, as does Xiaomi, which recently launched a money-market fund in beta.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon’s On-Demand Services Marketplace Launches Monday: Amazon’s Angie’s List competitor, called “Amazon Local Services,” has been rebranded as “Amazon Home Services” ahead of a larger launch happening Monday, sources familiar with the plans tell TechCrunch. The site, which previously featured only a limited number of service offerings in a handful of select markets, has also recently expanded to include a much larger number of categories of services as well as additional cities around the U.S.  As you may recall, Amazon Home Services quietly rolled out in late 2014 as the company’s initial foray in to providing a marketplace for services that would exist alongside its product offerings, offering the retailer another means of generating revenues outside of shipping physical products. Initially, the marketplace largely featured service providers whose businesses could help Amazon shoppers with additional needs that might follow a product purchase, however – like installers who could mount a new TV, for example. Now that expanded category line up is live – or at least it will be on Monday. On the rebranded “Amazon Home Services” website there are a variety categories beyond those that only relate to products Amazon sells. Top-level categories include Home Improvement, Lawn & Garden, Automotive, Computer & Electronics, and Lessons. There’s even a “More” category for those that don’t fit into the other groupings, which includes some more interesting services like “goat grazing” or “singing performances.” The idea here is to expand the marketplace to include any services a customer may need – even everyday needs like housecleaning or babysitting. In other words, with the official launch, Amazon is taking a big step to compete in the on-demand economy. But in our understanding, Amazon is partnering with some of these on-demand service startups, rather than trying to replace them entirely. This is a similar strategy to what Amazon has pursued with other initiatives, like its online art store or its Amazon Sellers program. Amazon could end up driving more business for some of these companies, the way it has provided additional customer flow for small retailers of physical goods. Also of note, Amazon hand-picks the businesses it includes on its site, and required all those who were listed to be licensed, insured and background-checked. The website previously said that Amazon would take a 20 percent cut of the services that cost under $1,000, and 15 percent for those over $1,000. But recently, the language on the website was updated, noting that, as of March 27, service fees are divided into three tiers: standardized, custom and recurring, each with a 5 percent transaction fee, and then with varying “service platform” fees ranging from 15 percent (standardized) to 19 percent (custom) to 5 percent (recurring). For consumers, the updated marketplace offers a number of features that could make it competitive to other providers, like Angie’s List, Yelp or Google’s business listings as a place to find providers. Because Amazon shoppers buy the services by placing them in an online cart, the company can verify the purchases leading to authenticated user reviews – meaning no one can slam a business out of spite or to take down a competitor. Instead, service reviews only come from real customers. Plus, the pros on the site offer Amazon the same pricing as if you dialed them direct, the website now claims – and if you find they offer a lower price, Amazon will match it. That change may be related to earlier complaints from consumers trying the service during its beta phase. Some found that they ended up haggling over pricing, and had trouble getting Amazon to pay up when they were given an incorrect quote.\\n\\n\\nAt developer conference F8, Facebook Opens Messenger for App Developers, Realtime Comments, New Ad Formats, Analytics for Apps,..: (more here and here) Today marked the first day of F8, Facebook’s annual developer conference, and the company announced a ton of stuff Messenger As A Platform: Facebook is opening up Messenger as a platform for developers. That means developers will be able to add in new functionality to Messenger — things like Giphy for on-the-fly GIF searching, goofy voice changers for voice messages, a drawing pad for doodling things up for your friends, etc. Think of it like a mini-app store within Messenger. New Realtime Comments System: Facebook’s Comment system (like the one you see in use at the bottom of this post) is pretty solid, but it’s been a while since it got much love. Today, it’s seeing a bit of an overhaul. New comments will show up in real time, comments will sync between the story page (this one) and the shared story item on our Facebook Page, FB Embeddable Videos: Facebook is making a move on YouTube’s turf, now allowing users to embed their Facebook videos on other sites. Will this mean less personal, home-video style content on YouTube? Maybe. Will Facebook start tapping these embedded video streams as yet another place for them to stick an ad? Almost certainly. Spherical Video: In a curious move, Facebook will now support 3D, spherical video in the newsfeed. You can pan around the video with your mouse cursor. While spherical video looks a bit strange on a flat screen, the key here is Facebook’s purchase of the Oculus Rift. Parse For Internet Of Things: FB launched Parse for Internet Of Things — a set of SDKs that act as the backend brains for IoT projects. It’s compatible with Arduino first, with other platforms on the way. LiveRail: Last year, Facebook bought LiveRail — an ad exchange that fills ad space within apps and sites to the highest bidder. Today, they made two changes: they’ll support mobile display ads in addition to video, and will be able to tap into a pool of anonymized Facebook data to determine which ad to show. Analytics For Apps: Facebook knows a lot about the users of their apps. Now they want to help developers figure out who is using their apps. Are most of the people playing your game female? Are they teenagers? Are those teenagers spending money in game, or are most buyers in their early 20s? Facebook’s new analytics platform helps you figure that out.\\n\\n\\nUber, Ola stare at a possible IP address block in India: (more here) The Delhi government has asked India’s information technology ministry to block the taxi-hailing apps of Uber and Ola in the national capital, news agency Reuters reports, quoting an unnamed government official. Yesterday, Delhi transport officials asked Uber and Ola to cease operations if they want their applications for radio taxi licenses to be processed. The officials had earlier asked the central government to block Uber’s IP address in India if the company does not abide by the law on running taxis. A block of the IP address would prevent passengers and drivers from accessing the app. Now, Ola too seems to be caught in this regulatory fix. Taxi-hailing apps hit a roadblock in India when an Uber driver raped a passenger in Delhi three months ago. This led to a ban in several Indian cities, and a close scrutiny of safety measures, driver screening, and liabilities that these ride-hailing companies assume. Uber had given in to a transport authority demand to apply for a radio taxi license in India, after initially insisting that it is not a radio taxi company. But its application fell short of what was required. The bone of contention is Uber’s insistence that it is just an internet platform connecting owners and drivers of cars with their customers, while regulators are equally insistent that it has to follow rules like any other taxi service. The transport authority refused to give a license to Uber unless it met the licensing conditions. On its part, Uber said it is “evaluating the perceived deficiencies in the time period provided to us by the government.” Uber tied up with First Advantage to do background checking of its drivers and included two new panic buttons on the Uber app – only in India – to persuade consumers and authorities that it is serious about safety. Earlier this week, it got into a “commercial marketing arrangement” with The Times of India Group to help ease its rollout across India.\\n\\n\\nTinder hacked, results in matches of unaware straight men, odd conversations: Flirting can be hard, especially through a screen. But these guys never had a chance, considering they were chatting with other heterosexual male users as part of a clever technological ruse. A hack on Tinder isn’t anything new. More tech-savvy folks have actually dug into the app to automatically swipe right on every potential match, and then there are all the marketers that are tricking folks into chatting with a brand instead of a human. But the Verge reports that a hacker recently set up a program that would use female dummy accounts to put heterosexual men into conversations with each other. Using Tinder’s API, the programmer was able to channel messages from one unknowing man to another, with both parties in the conversation believing instead that they were talking to a woman.\\n\\n\\n3 Pinterest Features Retailers Need to Know: Pinterest should, if not already, be an integral part of your e-commerce strategy. The site’s visual nature can help you provide detailed images to buyers, share products and information, draw buyers to your website and ultimately increase sales. It’s an ideal fit for brands and retailers looking to boost product visibility and purchases. Because of its relatively young age, Pinterest is still expanding at a considerable rate. Below are three innovative Pinterest features to have on your radar. Price Notifications: Price notifications are a recent practical addition to the social network. Users who pin a Rich Pin — pins that are available to business accounts and include extra information like a title, price and availability — that is later reduced in price will receive a notification alerting them to the price drop. This is a unique way to notify shoppers about price changes and to interact with potential customers. Because both Rich Pins and Pinterest business accounts are free of charge, we strongly recommend trying them out. Promoted Pins: promoted pinsCurrently a reservation-only program for US-based businesses, Promoted Pins are Pinterest’s foray into advertising. Retailers can promote specific pins to targeted audiences so that they show up in relevant search results and in users’ home feeds. You’ll be charged when people click through to your site. Pinterest has been testing the program in beta, and the company reports that advertisers experienced about a 30% increase in earned media from their Promoted Pins campaigns. Buy Button: Pinterest is following in the footsteps of Facebook and Twitter by adding a Buy button, which allows users to order and pay for products without leaving the social network’s website or app. Essentially, it’s a tool to reduce the steps in a consumer’s path to purchase Even though Pinterest is entering the social commerce game late, it has an advantage over Facebook and Twitter because its users are already coming to the site for product ideas and inspiration. When the act of pinning occurs, people are signaling some interest — if not clear purchase intent. Over the past five years the social giant has proven itself to be a big player in e-commerce. Think about it — 70 million active users are searching, sharing and “pinning” images of products. As Pinterest continues its rapid growth, more consumers will continue to trust the network to recommend quality products. This social channel is an ideal match for online retailers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle hired Morgan Stanley\\'s CFO to\\xa0succeed Patrick Pichette as its new CFO: Google said it hired Ruth Porat, Morgan Stanley’s chief financial officer, to succeed Patrick Pichette as its new CFO in May. Porat, 57, will leave Morgan Stanley in April after 28 years at the firm, the New York-based company said Tuesday in a memo to employees. Jonathan Pruzan, 46, co-head of global financial institutions banking, will become Morgan Stanley’s new CFO. Porat, one of Wall Street’s most senior female executives, pivots from a job in which she built up cash reserves for safety to one where she must figure out how to use Google’s growing cash pile. In five years as Morgan Stanley’s CFO, the Stanford University alumna has helped stabilize an investment bank that almost collapsed in 2008. “I’m delighted to be returning to my California roots and joining Google,” Porat said in a statement released by the Mountain View, California-based Internet company. “Growing up in Silicon Valley, during my time at Morgan Stanley and as a member of Stanford’s board, I’ve had the opportunity to experience first-hand how tech companies can help people in their daily lives. I can’t wait to roll up my sleeves and get started.”Silicon Valley has tapped Wall Street bankers to help them manage the finances associated with their rapid growth. Twitter Inc. last year named Anthony Noto, 46, previously Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s co-head of technology, media and telecommunications banking, as its CFO.\\n\\n\\nMore on the same: Its stock trailing peers, Google looks to Wall Street for CFO as costs, cash grow: Google Inc. is turning to Wall Street for its next chief financial officer as the technology giant grapples with rising costs, a growing pile of cash and a need for fiscal discipline as it invests in new industries. Ruth Porat, 57, will leave Morgan Stanley in April after more than 25 years there, the New York-based company said Tuesday in a memo to employees. Jonathan Pruzan, 46, Morgan Stanley’s co-head of global financial-institutions banking, will become the company’s new finance chief. At Google, Porat will succeed Patrick Pichette, who announced earlier this month that he would retire. She is set to take her new post on May 26. Investors are looking for Porat, one of the financial industry’s most senior female executives, to apply her financial acumen as Google invests to spur growth amid increased competition from Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. She follows other financial-services veterans who have migrated to Silicon Valley firms, such as social-media service Twitter Inc., payments-provider Square Inc. and messaging startup Snapchat Inc. “A dose of increased discipline could certainly serve Google well,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners LP. “The key to this job is going to be the person that rationalizes the expenses of the company. Google is full of people who want to pursue big ideas.” Google’s net income climbed 41 percent in its latest quarter from a year earlier, while Facebook’s increased 34 percent and Apple’s rose 38 percent. Google’s shares have lagged behind its rivals, dropping 0.3 percent in the year through Tuesday. Facebook’s shares meanwhile rose 33 percent, while Apple’s increased 64 percent. Google’s shares rose 2.2 percent to close at $577.54 on Tuesday.\\n\\n\\nTPG-backed AGS Transact plans up to $216.6 million India IPO: India\\'s AGS Transact Technologies, partly owned by U.S. private equity firm TPG Capital [TPG.UL], plans an up to 13.5 billion rupees ($216.6 million) initial public offering, according to a term sheet of the deal seen by Reuters on Wednesday. The company plans to raise up to 4 billion rupees by issuing new shares, while TPG and other shareholders would raise up to 9.5 billion rupees selling existing shares in AGS, which offers payment solutions and technology products to banks and retailers, the terms showed.\\n\\n\\nAccel announces $305M India fund, joins large tech investors accelerating India-focuse activity: Accel Partners has just announced a new US$305 million fund for India to invest in very early stage companies as well as those already in the growth trajectory. “The investment focus area will cover consumer, enterprise software, mobile, and healthcare businesses,” Subrata Mitra, partner with the VC firm, wrote on the company blog. This is Accel’s fourth fund for India. Accel has a star-studded portfolio of companies in India, including ecommerce major Flipkart, analytics company MuSigma, and cloud-based customer support provider Freshdesk. Since its Indian entry in 2005, it has had a few successful exits as well, including Myntra, which was acquired by Flipkart, TaxiForSure, which was acquired by Ola, and Virident, which was acquired by Western Digital. The venture capital flow into India moved to a new orbit last year, with nearly US$5 billion of startup funding. A number of big players have been pumping money into India. The leader of the pack is Tiger Global, the lead investor in Flipkart, which raised a whopping US$1.7 billion in 2014 alone. Tiger Global raised US$4 billion in two rounds last year, and a substantial portion of that can be expected to come to India. Sequoia is another big player from Silicon Valley, which raised a US$530 million India-focused fund last year. India-based VCs too are pulling in big bucks. Earlier this month, Saif Partners raised a US$350 million fund, and late last year, Lightbox VC raised a second fund of US$100 million. Investors focused on just the early stage startups have also been successful in raising money for India. 500 Startups and Blume Ventures have recently raised their second funds. There is growing interest from the east as well. SoftBank of Japan made three big investments last year in Snapdeal, Ola, and Housing. What’s more, it has pledged an investment of US$10 billion into India over the next few years. The rapid spread of smartphone and internet usage in a large population is one of the main factors making Indian tech startups attractive. An improvement in economic sentiment following the change in government is also making India the place to go for venture capital investors.\\n\\n\\nWith turn-by-turn directions, Google\\'s Waze app wants to win location-based mobile advertising: Two years after Google acquired Waze for more than $1 billion, new research and prolonged advertising deals from brands show that the mapping app is making a dent in the lucrative—and competitive—market of location-based mobile advertising. Waze has kept a relatively low profile since being acquired by the Mountain View, Calif.-based company, building up an ad business with a core group of retail, fast-food, gas and transportation brands. Equipped with data and a solid following of daily users who consistently use the app to navigate traffic, Google is battling Facebook, independent ad networks and Foursquare for a piece of what BIA/Kelsey forecasts will be a $15.5 billion market by 2018, up from $4.5 billion in 2014. New research released this week shows how the app\\'s promos affect ad recall and navigation rate, or the number of people who drove to a location after clicking on an ad. The mobile player offers advertisers two formats—branded pins and takeover ads. Branded pins show drivers how far away they are from stores. And takeovers are interstitial ads designed not to distract drivers. They pop up when a user is idle for three or more seconds and disappear when the car starts moving. Per Waze, ad recall increased 86 percent for drivers who saw branded pins compared to those who didn\\'t. And takeover ads boosted ad recall by 155 percent when compared to a group of drivers that was not served ads. To measure navigational lift, Waze compared how people searched and clicked for directions after seeing a brand\\'s ad, with a control group that did not see ads. On average, navigational lift increased 53 percent after either a pin or takeover ad. According to Jordan Grossman, head of U.S. sales at Waze, the average Waze user spends more than five hours with the app each month. That high level of engagement has kept advertisers coming back. After working with brands on quarterly campaigns in 2014, 25 percent of Waze advertisers—including Dunkin\\' Donuts, Phillips 66, Chick-fil-A, Panera Bread, Outback Steakhouse and Metrolink—are running yearlong campaigns for 2015. Waze crowdsources traffic data that brands can then use to target their promos by time, day and location. The app also has a partnership with Accuweather, pulling in real-time weather conditions like temperature, humidity and pollen count that brands can buy ads against. \"[Advertisers are] now drilling in on a tactical level and seeing there are a number of different layers that you can use to engage people within a mobile environment,\" Grossman said.\\n\\n\\nSlack said to be in talks to raise money at more than $2B valuation: Slack, the San Francisco start-up that makes a\\u200b workplace collaboration app, is back on the fund-raising trail and is\\u200b in talks to\\u200b rais\\u200be money at a valuation of more than $2 billion, according to \\u200ba person familiar with the matter. The talks come just four months after Slack, which is run by the entrepreneur Stewart Butterfield, raised $120 million at a valuation of more than $1 billion. The valuation could change because the talks are still occurring, according to this \\u200bperson, who requested anonymity because of continuing ties to the company. \\u200bBut the talks are another reflection of how Silicon Valley start-ups have been raising money at a furious pace, often snagging tens of millions of dollars and more than doubling their value just months after a previous financing round. Uber, the hugely popular ride-hailing app, has raised billions of dollars in little more than two years. Snapchat, a messaging start-up, has raised hundreds of millions in very short order as well. Bloomberg News earlier reported Slack’s new fund-raising. Mr. Butterfield declined a request for comment. In a recent interview, Mr. Butterfield acknowledged that Slack has “a lot of money and not a lot to spend on,” though he added the company is planning to increase its spending on marketing. The company employs just over 100 people. \\u200bTo date, Slack has raised about $180 million from firms such as Google Ventures, Accel Partners and Andreessen Horowitz, among others. Mr. Butterfield has been tossing around the idea of leasing a small storefront in one of San Francisco’s prime retail hotspots. A store, which might cost about $15,000 to $20,000 a month, could work as a public help desk for Slack’s rising number of users. It would also work to market the brand to new users. Slack was introduced about a year ago by Mr. Butterfield and now serves about half a million workers every day, who use the app as a kind of replacement for email and instant messaging. The company offers a free version of its product and also charges companies a monthly fee of $6.50 or more for each user if they want additional features. Mr. Butterfield recently said Slack wasn’t profitable and that its losses totaled “a couple hundred thousand dollars a month.”\\u200b\\n\\n\\nApple acquires NoSQL provider FoundationDB to bolster its server-side cloud technology: Apple has acquired FoundationDB, a company that specializes in speedy, durable NoSQL databases, TechCrunch has learned. A notice on the FoundationDB site notes that it’s no longer offering downloads of its database software. Financial terms of the deal were not available. CEO David Rosenthal was previously VP of Engineering at Omniture and co-founded the company with COO Nick Lavezzo and Dave Scherer in 2009. FoundationDB’s attractiveness came in the speed at which it handled ACID-compliant transactions and coupled that with strong scalability. FoundationDB hosted a booth at TechCrunch Disrupt SF in 2012, where we first wrote about its approach to a modern NoSQL database and its ‘NoSQL, YesACID’ motto. FoundationDB’s latest engine, which was covered by TC Columnist Jon Evans late last year, scaled up 14.4 million random writes per second. imag1829 A FoundationDB blog post on its newest engine made the following claim: At current (December 2014) AWS (non-spot) pricing and including enterprise FoundationDB licenses for all 480 cores with full 24/7 support this mega-cluster only costs about $150/hr. In that same hour this cluster will achieve 54 billion writes, yielding a cost-per-write of 3 nanodollars. Said another way, FoundationDB can do 3.6 million database writes per penny. So. A fast, affordable and durable database company, acquired by Apple. It seems likely that this was an acquisition designed to bolster Apple’s server-side technologies for the App Store, iTunes Connect or iTunes in the Cloud. With millions of apps now in the store and billions being served to users, there is undoubtedly room for improvement in those systems. Of course, there is always Apple’s rumored over-the-top TV service, which some reports claim is coming our way later this year. The need to be able to serve video at scale there will likely require bolstering systems, as we discussed with the head of media at the MLB just this week. The reliability and speed of Apple’s cloud services are more critical than ever now that it has shipped 700 million iPhones alone — along with millions more iPads and Macs — all of which use iCloud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

The investment made by Times Internet is worth about 1.5 billion rupees ($24 million), the Indian company said in an e-mailed reply to a question. The Economic Times newspaper, also published by Bennett, Coleman, had first reported the value of the deal citing people familiar with the transaction. The deal with Times Internet Ltd. will help increase the marketing and distribution of Uber’s services to more than 200 million consumers in India, the San Francisco-based company said in a statement on its blog, without giving details of the investment. Times Internet is a fully owned unit of Bennett, Coleman & Co., the flagship company of the Times of India Group and publisher of The Times of India newspaper. Uber counts India as its biggest market outside the U.S. and the fastest growing globally. Baidu Inc., China’s largest Internet search engine, in December agreed to invest in Uber and said the company will connect its map and mobile-search features with the ride-hailing service. Uber’s service is available in 11 Indian cities and offers three types of cars, including hatchbacks for as little as 7 rupees (11 cents) a kilometer.\\n\\n\\nChinese city Hangzhou cracks down on Taobao seller-on-seller dirty tricks: China’s online ecommerce market is massive, but it’s also kind of a jungle. Especially in the C2C wilderness that is Taobao, shop owners use all kinds of shady tactics like brushing to make sure they get the sale, whether or not the consumer is actually getting what they want. Now Hangzhou, they city that plays host to Alibaba HQ, has passed a new set of regulations on ecommerce transactions that makes behavior like that illegal and punishable by local authorities. The new regulations will require Hangzhou sellers to register as businesses with the ecommerce platform they use, and levy fines of RMB 10,000 to RMB 30,000 (US$1,600-4,800) on platforms that don’t collect the proper information. Sellers can also be fined between RMB 10,000 to RMB 30,000 for doing any of the following: (1) Using the name or trademark of a famous company, product, brand, person, social organization, or government organization without permission (2) Leave negative reviews for, slander, or falsely report rival sellers and shops (3) Buying products in bulk and then returning all of them or refusing to accept delivery to harm rival shopkeepers’ profits (4) Falsifying internet transactions [like “brushing”] to get good reviews (5) Using technological measures to interfere with search rankings (6) Releasing fake products or false service information Harming national interests, public interests, or the lawful rights of others (6) Additionally, sellers can be fined between RMB 2,000 and RMB 20,000 (US$320-3,200) if they engage in any kind of customer harassment like calling customers who left negative reviews and berating or threatening them until they change their review score. Because these laws were passed by the city of Hangzhou and not China’s national government, they don’t apply to all online sellers yet. But they certainly provide a window into the kinds of dirty tricks that some Chinese C2C shopkeeps go in for, and the dangers consumers still face when shopping on C2C marketplaces like Taobao.\\n\\n\\nApple Pay’s pitch: Simpler is better. But some security experts disagree. When Apple introduced its pay-by-smartphone feature last fall, the company touted the simplicity of the setup. All shoppers needed to do was wave their iPhones in front of a special scanner at the cash register — no need to fumble through pockets and purses for plastic cards or identification. But a sharp rise in reports of fraudulent Apple Pay transactions is raising questions about the security of the first mobile payment system to find a measure of popular success. One payments analyst, Cherian Abraham, estimated that as many as 6 percent of Apple Pay purchases are completed with stolen credit cards, or 60 times the rate of the old-fashioned plastic swipe. The problem is that Apple Pay may be too simple to set up, security analysts said. Fraudsters have been loading stolen cards onto iPhones to buy things at stores. As it turns out, it might have been better if Apple Pay required users to do more to prove their identities when they sign up for the service, these experts said. The balance between security and ease of use has long bedeviled technologists, especially those pushing for a new payment system to replace the plastic cards that are highly vulnerable to thieves. That need has grown more urgent as credit card hacks — such as those that have afflicted Target and Home Depot in recent years — have risen in scope and frequency. Mobile payments offer a potential solution. They are considered much harder to hack than traditional payment systems. And they avoid the swipe — a critical advancement since a lot of credit card numbers are stolen by fake card readers. But consumers, banks and retailers have been slow to embrace the technology, partly because of its complexity. Launched in October, Apple Pay was billed as simple to use, and the universe of stores and banks accepting the service has been growing steadily over the past few months. Apple boasts that Apple Pay is now accepted at hundreds of thousands of store locations. Bank of America said customers added 1.1 million of its credit and debit cards to Apple devices in the first two months of Apple Pay. JPMorgan Chase cited a similar figure. But reports of fraud are now giving retailers and banks some pause. “The issuers were probably so eager to be involved that they kind of forgot best practices and sidestepped some procedures they normally would’ve had [in order] to accept Apple Pay,” said Michelle Evans, senior analyst for consumer finance at market research firm Euromonitor.\\n\\n\\nGoogle Fiber Plans Experiment With Targeted Ads for Television: In a note to customers who subscribe to Google’s Google Fiber Internet and television service in Kansas City, Kan. and Kansas City, Mo., the search giant said it would soon begin a trial of local TV ads that will be aimed at a viewer’s locality and viewing habits. A spokeswoman who confirmed the service said Google expected it to roll out in the coming weeks. The move, if it were widely adopted by rival cable companies, could represent a sea change in how television ads are viewed and sold. For starters, it would mean that people in the same city might see different ads while watching the same show. It could also change how ads are sold by giving advertisers more leeway over when ads are shown, to whom and how often — the same kinds of control they have when advertising online. Google’s trial — which for now is aimed only at customers in the Kansas City area, who can opt out of having their viewing history used for advertising purposes — will use ads that are targeted by geography and what kinds of shows they view most often. “Fiber TV ads will be digitally delivered in real time and can be matched based on geography, the type of program being shown (like sports or news), or viewing history,” Google said in a online forum for Google Fiber. “If you’re a local business in Kansas City, just as with digital ads, you’ll only pay for ads that have been shown, and can limit the number of times an ad is shown to a given TV.” Analysts had been expecting Google to start experimenting with targeted television ads from the moment it announced its Google Fiber Internet service, which is about 100 times faster than the standard broadband connection. The company makes about $60 billion in annual revenue based largely on its ability to mine its user information to deliver highly targeted ads. Invidi Technologies, based in Princeton, N.J., makes software inside around 30 million United States cable boxes that can be used to target television ads based on age, gender, income, whether the viewer owns a dog or if their car lease is about to expire. Verizon, Dish, DirecTV and Comcast are all customers. “It is like direct mail for television,” said Michael Kubin, an executive vice president at Invidi.\\n\\n\\nChina\\'s tax environment is tightening - regulator to reap Alibaba windfall as tightens up on tax: China could make billions of dollars from taxing gains made by employees of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (BABA.N) who are free to sell their shares for the first time since its IPO, as the country tightens up its leaky mechanisms for tax collection. On Wednesday, a six-month lock-up period for the recently New York-listed stock expired, allowing insiders who bought 437 million shares prior to the IPO to sell their stock, though 100 million of them are subject to trading restrictions that apply to employees until the company reports results in May. The total lock-up represents roughly 18 percent of Alibaba\\'s shares, which if sold would fetch just over $37 billion at Friday\\'s closing price. Although Alibaba did not disclose the identity of the shareholders subject to the lock-up, many will be taxable in China, where most of its 22,000 people are employed, and its share scheme is subject to a number of controls that will help ensure China gets its tax. Current and former employees hold around 26.7 percent of the company, having built up holdings through stock options and other incentives since 1999, according to a Reuters report from June using IPO securities filings. Those subject to the expiring lock-up will have obtained their shares at different times and costs, so the gains figure is unknown, but the tax is expected to reach billions of dollars for China\\'s State Administration of Taxation (SAT). While tax on employee compensation is withheld by employers, tax on share sales must be declared by employees, meaning it\\'s typically harder for the authorities to track. It is not uncommon for employees participating in Chinese company stock incentive schemes to transfer their shares to offshore trusts in the Cayman or British Virgin Islands to avoid tax, according to a person who helps create such structures. But Alibaba\\'s newly minted millionaires won\\'t escape the gaze of the tax inspector, said a Beijing-based accountant. \"Because it was such a large IPO, the tax bureau will for sure be monitoring that.\" While the potential tax windfall is tiny relative to China\\'s total fiscal revenue of 14 trillion yuan ($2.26 trillion) last year, it reflects the government\\'s more rigorous stance on tax.\\n\\n\\nFacebook May Host News Sites’ Content: Nothing attracts news organizations like Facebook. And nothing makes them more nervous. With 1.4 billion users, the social media site has become a vital source of traffic for publishers looking to reach an increasingly fragmented audience glued to smartphones. In recent months, Facebook has been quietly holding talks with at least half a dozen media companies about hosting their content inside Facebook rather than making users tap a link to go to an external site. Such a plan would represent a leap of faith for news organizations accustomed to keeping their readers within their own ecosystems, as well as accumulating valuable data on them. Facebook has been trying to allay their fears, according to several of the people briefed on the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were bound by nondisclosure agreements. Facebook intends to begin testing the new format in the next several months, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. The initial partners are expected to be The New York Times, BuzzFeed and National Geographic, although others may be added since discussions are continuing. The Times and Facebook are moving closer to a firm deal, one person said. To make the proposal more appealing to publishers, Facebook has discussed ways for publishers to make money from advertising that would run alongside the content. Facebook has said publicly that it wants to make the experience of consuming content online more seamless. News articles on Facebook are currently linked to the publisher’s own website, and open in a web browser, typically taking about eight seconds to load. Facebook thinks that this is too much time, especially on a mobile device, and that when it comes to catching the roving eyeballs of readers, milliseconds matter. In addition to hosting content directly on Facebook, the company is talking with publishers about other technical ways to hasten delivery of their articles. Even marginal increases in the speed of a site, said Edward Kim, chief executive of the analytics and distribution company SimpleReach, generally mean big increases in user satisfaction and traffic. So it is likely, he said, that Facebook’s plan focuses on those small improvements, rather than on getting money from deals with media companies. “But there are a lot of implications for publishers,” he added. “It really comes down to how Facebook structures this, and how they can ensure this is a win on both sides.” The issue is also pressing, he said, because some media companies have seen a drop in traffic from Facebook that could be attributed to the company’s prioritizing of video — a much more lucrative medium for ad sales.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFidelity, T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, all giant US money managers, are adding Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest and other private tech investments to mainstream portfolios:\\xa0Tech Money Sends Funds on the Hunt for Unicorns: The retirement accounts of millions of Americans have long contained shares of stalwart companies like General Electric, Ford and Coca-Cola. Today, they are likely to include riskier private stocks from Silicon Valley start-ups like Uber, Airbnb and Pinterest. Big money managers including Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price and BlackRock have all struck deals worth billions of dollars to acquire shares of these private companies that are then pooled into mutual funds that go into the 401(k)’s and individual retirement accounts of many Americans. With private tech companies growing faster than companies on the stock market, the money managers are aiming to get a piece of the action. Fidelity’s Contrafund includes $204 million in Pinterest shares, $162 million in Uber shares, and $24 million in Airbnb shares. Over all, there were 29 deals last year in which a mutual fund bought into a private company, and they were worth a collective $4.7 billion, according to CB Insights. That was up from six such deals, worth a combined $296 million, in 2012. T. Rowe Price was the most active big investor, making 17 investments in private tech companies. Because these tech companies are not required to issue financial reports and are not traded on traditional exchanges, they are the sort of speculative investments not normally found in retirement accounts. Increasingly, however, investors are betting that these companies will be bought or go public at prices that exceed their latest funding rounds, a prospect that is anything but guaranteed. “I think it goes beyond what mutual funds were set up to do,” said Leonard Rosenthal, a professor of finance at Bentley University in Waltham, Mass. “It’s great for the portfolio manager, but it’s not necessarily in the interest of the shareholders of the fund. If investors are looking for a portfolio of risky securities, there are plenty of stocks to trade in the public market.” The dilemma for big fund managers is that fast-growing technology companies are so reluctant to sell private stock to the public that there is now a term — “unicorns,” reflecting just how wonderful and magical they are considered to be — for the dozens of private firms worth $1 billion or more. Several, including the ride-hailing company Uber, the room rental site Airbnb and the digital scrapbook Pinterest are worth more than $10 billion. Those lofty valuations, combined with the eagerness investors show in bidding them up, have created a shadowy market for private stock issued to tech companies’ early investors and employees. For the last few years, mutual funds have sat on the sidelines. Now, they are racing to get in. “More and more, the big lopsided growth is happening away from the public markets,” said Andrew Boyd, head of global capital equity markets at Fidelity. Take Uber, which was valued around $40 billion in its latest round of financing, up from $3.5 billion in mid-2013. That is more than 1,000 percent growth, compared with 28 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index over the same time period.\\n\\n\\nChina’s Internet Boom seems to fade:\\xa0Half of the 14 Chinese dot-coms that debuted in the U.S. last year are now trading below their initial sale prices. Even Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., one of those still up in price, has dropped 28 percent from its record high in November. On average, the 14 Chinese shares are down 3.1 percent this year, compared with a 6.1 percent advance in the Nasdaq. Investor confidence, so high when Alibaba brought its record $25 billion initial public offering to market last September, is being undermined now by a wave of poor earnings at Chinese technology companies. Those that went public last year including Weibo Corp., the microblogging service, and mobile dating app developer Momo Inc. have failed to deliver the revenue investors were expecting. Sixteen of 28 Internet and technology firms in Bloomberg’s China benchmark reported fourth-quarter earnings below analysts’ forecasts, including search engine Baidu Inc. and video website Youku Tudou Inc. The percentage of stocks that slid below their IPO levels this year was the highest since 2011, when a series of corporate scandals eroded investor confidence, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\\n\\n\\nShoppers on Lazada last year spent $350 million as ecommerce booms in Southeast Asia: Rocket Internet’s Amazon-esque Lazada saw more than US$350 million in consumer purchases in 2014, group CEO Maximillian Bittner tells Tech in Asia. US$70 million of that spending (termed gross merchandise volume, or GMV) happened in December alone, due to Christmas and special promotions like the 12/12 sales day. The 2014 spending tally represents strong growth for Lazada from US$89 million in 2013. Lazada is this week celebrating its third anniversary. It operates in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Lazada started out doing only direct sales to consumers from its own warehouses, but that changed in the fall of 2013 as the company launched a marketplace for third-party merchants. Those merchants now take in 70 to 75 percent of the consumer spending on the estore, Bittner reveals. They’re a “core driver of growth” on Lazada, he adds. There are now 15,000 merchants using the site as an online storefront. “It’s not a target to be a 100 percent marketplace,” Bittner emphasizes. “It depends on the best price for consumers” and other factors such as whether Lazada itself or third-party merchants have better purchasing power. Indonesia is Southeast Asia’s largest single market, and Bittner says the archipelago is the top market for Lazada. Indonesia’s shoppers made up over 30 percent of Lazada’s 2014 spending tally. While Indonesia has an array of homegrown rivals to Lazada – from well-funded Tokopedia to the new Matahari Mall – Bittner says the nation is not necessarily a tougher market than the other Southeast Asian countries. “There’s a growing dynamic of excitement” about Indonesia’s ecommerce scene right now, adds Bittner. He adds that exclusive online gadget sales for brands like Xiaomi and Motorola have helped Lazada greatly in Indonesia. Xiaomi uses Lazada as its sole sales channel in both Indonesia and the Philippines.\\n\\n\\nTouted by some as the next Facebook, Meerkat is living the dream of every app creator. Three weeks after launching, it is enjoying viral growth. It’s been the talk of SXSW. Presidential candidates and celebrities are using it. It’s been called the new technology that will affect the 2016 presidential election. Prominent investors want to help fund it. 1. Its numbers are multiplying. Meerkat told me Thursday that its user base is growing 30 to 40 percent a day since SXSW started March 13. It signed up 120,000 users in its first two weeks, so should be closing in on the one million user mark. (Thirty-five percent daily growth compounded over a week would put it just short of one million) 2. Its founder is a genuinely likable guy. In a recent interview with Re/code, chief executive Ben Rubin corrected an interviewer who credited him as “the man behind the app Meerkat,” saying “We’re the team behind the app Meerkat.” 3. Meerkat is obsessed with making its user comfortable. If you talk with anyone on the Meerkat team, they’ll almost certainly use the word “comfortable.” It’s a value that’s guided their decisions, including embracing the trend toward vertical video on smartphones. “We wanted to lower the barrier to entry and make the behavior as comfortable and as familiar as possible given that the medium is still pretty unfamiliar to a lot of people within the context of social media,” community director Ryan Cooley told me at SXSW. Rubin made a really interesting parallel between smartphone live-streaming and the first photographs, during a recent interview with host Ryan Hoover on Product Hunt Radio. “When the first cameras arrived, people weren’t smiling. It was weird to smile in a picture. People don’t have that habit of taking a picture or being in a picture. It evolved,” Rubin said. “With live video, we don’t have this habit. My mother didn’t live stream, I didn’t live stream when I was a kid.” The challenge for Meerkat is to make everyone — especially people who aren’t early adopters– comfortable with live streaming. Because Meerkat videos aren’t stored and can’t be rewatched later, it’s a less intimidating experience. You don’t have to worry about slipping up, and having that mistake be re-lived forever. You simply hit a button on your phone, and suddenly people are digitally right there with you. \\n\\n\\nGoogle launches Retail Search Ad with local inventory offering: Early success as Sears Hometown store visits jumped 122 percent: Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores, a retailer fighting for every sale, has evidently found a weapon in Google\\'s Local Inventory Ads that it says works to drive consumers to its stores. The digital marketing product is still fairly new from the search giant, launched last year, and holds the promise of finally helping brick-and-mortar brands take advantage of the online world rather than always getting beaten by it. With that in mind, the Sears spinoff company has been running Google\\'s shopping ads that target by location and reveal whether a product is actually in a location. As part of a Google report today, the retail company claimed that such information has worked to generate 122 percent more visits to its 1,240 shops under the Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores brand. The Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based chain\\'s click-through rate was 16 percent higher on inventory ads when compared to other ad products. \"The ad unit is terrific for a mobile experience,\" said David Buckley, CMO of Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores. \"It\\'s highly relevant to where you are, and it\\'s served with an image, price attributes, and how far you\\'re standing from that product. It\\'s the ultimate search ad product for mobile. You can\\'t ask for more than that.\"\\n\\n\\nOla diversifies to add a mobile-only food ordering option: Online cab booking service Ola (formerly Olacabs), run by Mumbai-based ANI Technologies Pvt Ltd, has expanded its business area by adding a location-based online food delivery option under Ola Cafe. Unlike its core business, where one can book a cab ride through the web or through the mobile app, the food ordering option is restricted to its app, making it a mobile-only feature. The new feature is available on the latest update of the Ola app. The firm said this is currently in beta stage. The company plans to go pan-India but, to begin with, it has started the service in four cities — Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Bangalore. Moreover this is not for ordering from restaurants across the city but only from those located near to the user and in some identified areas. The service can be availed from 12 pm to 11 pm. The company did not disclose the number of restaurants it has tied up so far. It did not say if it proposes to use cabs in the vicinity, which do no have a passenger on board yet, to make the deliveries. Users can pay by either Ola money (it’s closed online wallet) or cash on delivery. The delivery person will call customers to confirm the address, just the way a driver of cab or auto currently calls to confirm addresses for pick-ups. Users can also track the person handling the food delivery via the app, like one can do a cab approaching the user.\\n\\n\\nHackers Attack GreatFire.org, a Workaround for Websites Censored in China: For years, a group of anonymous activists known as GreatFire.org has monitored online censorship in China, provided access to blocked websites and collected messages deleted by censors. This week, unidentified hackers have tried to put an end to those activists’ efforts with an unprecedented attack. In a post to its blog Thursday, GreatFire.org said it has experienced a massive so-called denial of service attack. The method is one that hackers frequently use to foil websites by flooding them with multiple requests — so many that they go offline and viewers see a blank page. GreatFire.org creates encrypted versions of 12 websites that are blocked in China. These are known as mirrored websites and grant users within China access to the content. On Thursday, GreatFire.org said it was receiving 2.6 billion requests an hour for its mirrored websites. On Friday, access to the mirrored websites was inconsistent in China. GreatFire.org’s name is inspired by the Great Firewall, the term often used to describe China’s Internet censorship. About two million people in China access GreatFire’s websites each month, a co-founder of the group who uses the pseudonym Charlie Smith, wrote in an email exchange. It was unclear who was responsible for the attack, which began Tuesday  from inside and outside China, Mr. Smith wrote. GreatFire.org noted in its blog post that its tactics were the recent subject of a report in The Wall Street Journal, which appeared online Monday. The timing for the attack was a mystery. “Maybe that WSJ story,” Mr. Smith wrote. “Maybe because there have been some excellent Chinese-language news pieces and perhaps somebody who supports the authorities took issue with them. In the past there has rarely been rhyme or reason on the timing of such attacks.” GreatFire.org’s mirroring services provide unrestricted access within China to a range of websites, including itself and the Chinese language version of The New York Times, which has been regularly blocked in China. Some of the others are Deutsche Welle, BBC News, China Digital Times, Google.com, and Boxun, a Chinese-language news website. GreatFire.org says it does not mirror The Wall Street Journal.  GreatFire.org works directly with some, but not all, of the websites it mirrors. GreatFire.org is partly funded by Open Technology Fund, a United States government-financed initiative under Radio Free Asia. Last year it provided $114,000 in funding, according to its website. Mr. Smith declined to comment on any financial backing. The Chinese government has in the last year ramped up efforts to prevent its citizens from accessing critical news coverage from abroad and from communicating on social media platforms that the government cannot directly censor. China has long disrupted many of Google’s services. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube remain blocked. LinkedIn agreed to censor its content to operate in the Chinese market last year. GreatFire’s mirroring websites circumvent the Great Firewall by channeling Internet traffic through cloud services, such as one available from Amazon.  The difficulty for the Chinese government is that it can’t just shut off Amazon’s service, because it is used broadly by many major Chinese corporations. Emails to the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Chinese embassy in Washington went unanswered as of Friday evening. \\n\\n\\nWeb-hosting giant GoDaddy files for $481M IPO, seeking $2.87B valuation: US-based GoDaddy.Inc, an internet domain registrar and web hosting solutions provider, has fixed the price band for its initial public offer (IPO) which may raise $480.7 million, including the portion allocated to the underwriters. It proposes to list on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), as per a disclosure this week. The firm is offering shares at $17-19 a unit which would value the company as much as $2.87 billion. GoDaddy first attempted to go public in 2006 but ultimately withdrew. It had refiled for an IPO in June 2014. The IPO proceeds will primarily be used for repaying some of the debt the company. took on as part of a 2011 buyout by private-equity firms Silver Lake, KKR & Co. and TCV Investments. GoDaddy currently manages 57 million domains which accounts for around 21 per cent of the world’s registered domains. Since its buyout, it has acquired other services, including Mad Mimi, which helps small businesses promote themselves by email, and Locu, which makes software that manages business-contact information across sites like Yelp and OpenTable. Services made up 8 per cent of its revenue in 2014. The company’s revenue last year was $1.4 billion, up from $1.1 billion in 2013. Its 2014 net loss, which included $85 million in interest costs to service debt, narrowed to $143 million from $200 million a year earlier. As of December 31, 2014, it had approximately 12.7 million customers, and in 2014, it added more than 1.1 million customers. In 2014, the firm generated $1.7 billion in total bookings up from $939 million in 2010, representing a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 16 per cent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon scores US regulators’ nod to test fly its autonomous drones:\\xa0\\xa0The Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday gave Amazon permission to conduct test flights of its drones outdoors, as long as the company obeys a host of rules like flying below 400 feet and only during daylight hours.\\xa0\\xa0Amazon has envisioned its drone-delivery service, which it calls Amazon Prime Air, to be autonomous.\\xa0\\xa0While the F.A.A. has announced plans to allow more commercial uses of manned drones in American skies, it has not said when it will permit the use of autonomous drones by companies like Amazon. The company’s drones for now will have to be operated by a pilot with a certificate to fly a private manned aircraft. The agency’s main concern is making sure that drones, which everyone from farmers to cinematographers have shown interest in using for business purposes, can be operated safely. Still, even getting permission to test drones outdoors with a pilot counts as progress for Amazon, which has been lobbying the F.A.A. for approval to do so for months. The company has previously been forced to test drones indoors near its headquarters in Seattle. It has also started outdoor tests outside the United States and has warned federal regulators that jobs and investment dollars will leave the country if they do not relax their current drone restrictions.\\n\\n\\nTaking on Apple Inc,\\xa0Google and Intel to Team Up with TAG Heuer on a Luxury Smartwatch:\\xa0On Thursday, TAG Heuer, the Swiss watch company, announced that it was building a new smartwatch — a wrist computer, in essence — as part of a collaboration with Intel and Google. The companies made a joint announcement at Baselworld, an annual show in Basel, Switzerland, for high-priced watches and jewelry. The watch will be released later this year, but aside from that the announcement was light on specifics. No exact release date. Nothing about what it will do. No price. The forthcoming TAG Heuer watch will be designed and manufactured by the Swiss watchmaker. The technology bits will come from Intel’s chip technology and Google’s Android software.\\n\\n\\nSmartstraps may be the solution to wearables:\\xa0Pebble seeds $1M to encourage smartstrap startups:\\xa0Pebble is announcing a $1 million fund to support the development of smartstraps, the add-on accessories that are open to hardware makers and that will add functionality to Pebble Time via add-on sensors, batteries and more.

Facebook hopes to make Messenger more useful, after seeing Asia’s chat apps WeChat and Line succeed as platforms that go beyond just texting with friends. At first, Facebook will focus on how third parties can build ways for content and information to flow through Messenger. Depending on the success of the early experiments, Facebook may then mull bringing more utilities to Messenger. For Messenger’s platform, Facebook is said to have eyed Line and WeChat. They were pioneers in using their frequently used instant messaging apps as the centers of mobile interfaces that act as monolithic portals. Snapchat is another messaging app that’s recently explored a platform approach.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTesla to have Autopilot on its cars by summer:\\xa0\\xa0Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla, took a big step when he announced that the maker of high-end electric cars would introduce autonomous technology by this summer. The technology would allow drivers to have their cars take control on what he called “major roads” like highways. Mr. Musk said that a software update — not a repair performed by a mechanic — would give Tesla’s Model S sedans the ability to start driving themselves, at least part of the time, in a hands-free mode that the company refers to as autopilot. Also to be added are tools to help drivers monitor the status of charging stations and plot routes to ensure the ability to complete a trip without running out of battery power. The move is intended to help reduce so-called range anxiety, the fear drivers have that their battery will run out, prompting them to constantly calculate distances and worry about being stranded.\\n\\n\\nGoDaddy\\'s IPO to value web-hosting company at up to $2.87 billion: Web-hosting company GoDaddy Inc\\'s initial public offering is expected to value the company at up to $2.87 billion, and comes at a time when there has been a steep fall in the number of companies going public in the United States. Including debt, the company could be valued at $4 billion. The IPO market has had a slow start this year compared with 2014 when U.S. IPOs raised about $93 billion, the highest since 2000. Only two technology companies have gone public this year including online data storage provider Box Inc, whose shares have dropped about 27 percent since the company\\'s market debut in January.

Microsoft dismantled another piece of its old way of doing business on Wednesday. As part of a broader announcement of partnerships in China, the company said it would allow existing users of Windows personal computers in the country to upgrade free to Windows 10, its coming operating system. The offer is good not only for people who have paid for legitimate copies of Windows on their machines, but those that have pirated copies of the software. The near term effect on Microsoft’s sales is likely to be minimal. The overwhelming majority of Windows software in China is pirated. Only 1 out of every 10 copies of Microsoft’s software in the the country is legitimately purchased, the company’s former chief executive, Steve Ballmer, once said. Microsoft has little Windows licensing revenue in China to jeopardize by giving away free upgrades. But the move echoes a shift at Microsoft and the software industry’s around the world.  This happened first in mobile, a market in which Microsoft has pitifully small market share and, in a variation of its situation in China, not a lot of revenue to lose. Last year it eliminated its licensing fee on Windows for manufacturers creating devices with screens smaller than 9 inches. Then in January, Microsoft said it would let people running the latest versions of Windows on their computers upgrade free to Windows 10. The company’s executives have downplayed the impact that these changes will have on its business model, and for the time being they are right. Most of Microsoft’s Windows revenue comes from sale of the software to PC manufacturers who put the software on their new machines, not to consumers who pay for Windows upgrades to existing machines. Corporate customers will stay need to pay Microsoft for long term agreements that keep their software up to date. How long can these remaining honeypots of Windows revenue last? Windows PCs are under growing pressure at the low end of the consumer PC market from Chromebooks, cheap laptops running a Google operating system, and tablets. To combat their growth, Microsoft last year was forced to cut its Windows licensing fees for laptops that sell for less than $250, which hurt its financial results. For its most recent fiscal year, which ended last June 30, Microsoft’s revenue from Windows for PCs was $16.9 billion, down from $17.6 billion the prior year. Al Hilwa, an analyst at IDC, the technology research firm, predicts that corporate customers will continue to pay Microsoft for long-term software agreements that include Windows. Still, he said, “there’s a slippery slope aspect” to the pricing changes happening to Windows in the consumer market. “Sooner or later, enterprises will say, ‘We don’t want to pay for it,\\'” he said. To make up for lost Windows licensing fees, Mr. Hilwa believes Microsoft will increasingly rely on revenue sources. In a nod to Apple, it will emphasize hardware devices that come coupled with software, like its Surface tablets. And in a nod to Google, it will seek to make money from advertising and other services on its devices.\\n\\n\\n...A big name tech investor makes big bets on startup-to-startup APIs: The best way to do business isn’t to build it all in-house. Top companies are increasingly piecing together a composite of APIs from specialized startups. That lets them concentrate on their unique value-add rather than reinventing the wheel. Now those building blocks are turning into big businesses of their own with unique challenges. How do they get traction for their APIs? What does it take to support a developer ecosystem? How much should they charge? Accel Partners thinks it can help. It’s learned from investments in Braintree, Segment.io, Slack, and Checkr. But Accel also knows it missed the boat on Twilio and Heroku. So to attract more API businesses and share its insights, Accel is announcing a new investment focus in what it calls “APX,” the API-ification of business. Developers are constantly posed with the question of whether to buy or build. You either pay for a specialized API or you spend the resources trying to replicate them. But as the cogs get more complex, and the talent wars rage on, in-house development keeps looking slower and more expensive. “You don’t need to go out and source the talent to build these functions,” Natarjan tells me. “You can outsource entire swatches of your company to very reliable APIs. It’s a bit of a talent arbitrage game.” Wong followed up, asking “Why would you go start your own payments capabilities, your own payment analytics, your own map capabilities when they’re so easily accessible from these other companies and are arguably better?” Take background checks, for example. On-demand and sharing economy startups like Instacart or Homejoy need to know the contractors they send to customers’ houses aren’t going to rob them. Normally, these companies would have to hire a team to compare potential hires’ identities against watch lists and criminal records. But their businesses are about grocery delivery and home cleaning, not background checks, so building a team or system to handle them would be a distraction. “With Checkr, that whole function has been reduced to an API,” Natarjan says. Instead of recreating something done better elsewhere, “You can dedicate 100% of your efforts to the 1% that is going to differentiate a product.” “APX is the current picks and shovels,” Accel Partner Rich Wong tells me, alluding to the success of merchants who sold mining tools during the gold rush.\\n\\n\\nIndia Startup Action: Capillary Technologies in talks with Temasek to raise $80M: Capillary Technologies Pvt Ltd, a SaaS-based CRM solutions provider, is in talks to raise $80 million (Rs 501 crore) from Singapore’s state-owned investment firm Temasek, and a few other investors, sources privy to the development told Techcircle.in. Capillary was set up in August 2008 by IIT Kharagpur alumni Reddy, Krishna Mehra and Ajay Modani. It is into cloud-based software solutions that help retailers engage with customers through mobile, social and in-store channels. The firm claims that its integrated marketing platform helps retailers easily manage their customer data, gain insights and personalise engagement across multiple channels. The company caters primarily to the clients in the retail market, and as of July last year, 40 per cent of its revenues came from apparel, fashion and shoes; 30 per cent from food retail; 20 per cent from white goods and electronics and remaining 10 per cent from pharmacies and hypermarkets. During the same time, it claimed its platform was powering more than 150 brands across 10,000 retail locations. Its clients include Pizza Hut, Benetton, KFC, Puma, Marks & Spencer and Lacoste. In July 2014, Capillary had raised $14 million in its Series B round of funding led by existing investors Sequoia Capital and Norwest Venture Partners (NVP). This round came barely five months after the firm netted $4.5 million in funding from American Express Ventures. This was preceded by a $17 million in its Series A round of funding from Sequoia, NVP and Qualcomm Ventures in 2012.\\n\\n\\nUber’s Car-Hailing Service Banned in Germany, Court Says. A German court ordered Uber Technologies Inc. to stop its ride-hailing service in the country for profit, dealing a blow to the startup’s expansion plans outside the U.S. It is anti-competitive that Uber routes requests for rides via its UberPop application to drivers “that have no legitimation according to the Passenger Transportation Act, and hence the company is instigating to break the law,” the Frankfurt regional court said in a statement Wednesday. The verdict will affect Uber’s services in Frankfurt and Munich. In Dusseldorf, Berlin and Hamburg, the company has already changed its business model, cutting the fare it charges to as little as 35 euro cents (37 U.S. cents) per kilometer -- effectively turning UberPop into one of Germany’s many non-profit share-a-ride services -- to evade an earlier ban issued by local authorities. “This is a setback, in particular, for all those who want more of a choice when it comes to their personal mobility,” San Francisco-based Uber said in a statement. “It is also a setback for society as a whole, because for the time being most individual transport services will remain expensive and thus not be affordable for everyone.” Uber said it would probably file an appeal. Today’s ruling doesn’t affect its UberBlack limousine service and uberTAXI offers. “We will not give up on the German market,” it said.\\n\\n\\nYahoo Is Said to Cut 300 Jobs as Part of China Office Close: Yahoo is reportedly laying off 200 to 300 employees in China, shutting down its Beijing research center and pulling out what few operations it has left in the country, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Beijing office was Yahoo’s only physical presence in the country, consisting mainly of engineers working on research and development. They make up about 2 percent of Yahoo’s global staff. A string of layoffs since October have led to as many as 900 people searching for new employment, mostly countries outside the US like Bangalore, India, and Canada. A photo circulating on Chinese social media reportedly shows a slide show presentation at Yahoo’s office in Beijing, explaining to the employees the forthcoming agenda as they prepare to leave their jobs. It seems some employees would have the option of relocating to the US, while others receive a severance package equal to four months base salary plus the number of years employed multiplied by their average monthly income. Within hours of the announcement recruiters and HR departments at other tech companies were, as one source told Tech in Asia, \"feeding on the leftover talent.\" The following screenshot is of a WeChat group of 340 headhunters and HR managers from a wide array of both large and small internet companies. The name of the group, in English, is \"Yahoo recruitment group.\" WSJ reports the layoffs were driven by financial motives, and not related to censorship or government pressure. Yahoo’s China web domain now redirects to its Singapore site.\\n\\n\\nUxin, Platform for China\\'s Used-Car Market, Raises $170 Million: An online auction house for used cars in China has attracted $170 million from big name investors including the search engine company Baidu, the private equity group K.K.R. and Coatue Management, a New York investment firm. Uxin, which operates used-car auction websites in China that focus on dealers and businesses, said Wednesday that it would use the funds to expand a new website and mobile app aiming at individual consumers. The company also provides inspections, quality guarantees and financing for the vehicles sold on its platforms. “Uxin hopes to use the strengths of its Internet technologies and experience in the used-car market to improve the efficiency of transactions, and to help dealers identify potential buyers with greater accuracy,” Chris Dai, the chief executive of the Chinese company, said in a statement. China is the world’s biggest market for new car sales, but the market for used cars is still comparatively small. Many Chinese are first-time car buyers and see owning a new vehicle as a status symbol. The country’s used-car market has traditionally been highly fragmented and lacking information on the service and repair history of the vehicles being sold. But things appear to be changing rapidly. Transactions in China’s used-car market rose 26 percent in 2014 from a year earlier, to 368 billion renminbi, or about $60 billion. The number of used cars changing hands rose 16 percent to about six million vehicles in the same period, according to figures from the China Automobile Dealers Association cited by Uxin. Online sales and auctions of used cars accounted for a small segment of the market, but they have the advantage of connecting buyers and sellers in different cities or provinces. Uxin said it handled more than 150,000 online and offline car auction transactions a year. The terms of the shareholdings were not disclosed, but for Baidu, China’s biggest online search engine company, investing in Uxin gives it a new market where it can leverage its vast stores of data and large user base. For K.K.R., the deal is the latest by its China Growth Fund, which last summer invested about $400 million in a chicken breeder in Fujian Province in southeastern China.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook continues edging into commerce - introduces free friend-to-friend payments through messages: (More here and here) Facebook‘s instant messaging service isn’t just for sending smiley faces and photos anymore. Now you can use it to send money instantly to your friends. Facebook, the social networking company, announced Tuesday that American users of its Messenger app would be able to link their debit cards to the service and use it to message money to one another just as easily as they send a snapshot or text. Given Facebook’s huge size and reach, the introduction of its payments feature — which has been highly anticipated by Wall Street — is likely to cause tremors in the nascent market for instantly sending money to individuals, known as peer-to-peer payments. And analysts said that if the payment system succeeded, Facebook would extend it to other types of purchases, such as consumers’ buying of products directly from advertisers. “Facebook could use this as a back door to get people’s debit cards to enable the buy button,” said Robert Peck, an Internet analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. WeChat, which is essentially the Facebook of China, and other Asia-based communications services like Alipay already allow their hundreds of millions of users to send money via instant message. But the technology is only beginning to appear in the United States, where email payment services like PayPal have long been more popular. As messaging has begun to eclipse email as the preferred form of electronic communication, especially among younger users, Facebook has sought to dominate that market much as it dominates social networking. The company’s Messenger app is one of the largest platforms in the world, with more than 500 million monthly users. And last year, Facebook spent nearly $22 billion to buy WhatsApp, a separate messaging platform that now counts more than 700 million active users globally. In the United States, a host of peer-to-peer money transfer services have emerged and are trying to capture the wallets of messaging enthusiasts.\\n\\n\\n\"Insights as a service\" - IBM introduces twitter-fueled data services for business: IBM is betting a fair share of its future on exploiting large troves of data for its business customers, and Twitter is a big-data fire-hose with 6,000 tweets a second, more than half a billion each day. And Twitter’s data-licensing business, though still a small part of the company, is growing rapidly. IBM and Twitter are bringing out the first products on Tuesday, developer tools and cloud-based data analysis services that mine Twitter data. The data services run on IBM’s Watson artificial intelligence technology and on its flavor of Hadoop, the open-source software for processing big data across computer clusters, IBM BigInsights. The developer tools will allow people to write applications that pull in Twitter data. In recent months, IBM has trained more than 4,000 engineers and consultants on using Twitter data in business projects. Its goal is to have 10,000 IBM employees with Twitter data-handling skills. And IBM has worked with more than 100 corporate clients so far, in a range of industries and projects. “We thought the early interest would be in consumer products and marketing, but it has turned out to be much broader than that,” said Alistair Rennie, general manager of IBM’s analytics business. The early work, he said, included companies that want to tap the Twitter data to help guide product development and plan manufacturing schedules. IBM is not naming the companies that have tried out its Twitterized technology, but it did describe a few examples of what it calls “insight as a service.” It combined tweets with hyper-local weather data to help predict where disgruntled telephone or cable customers, whose service might be impaired by severe weather, were most likely to switch suppliers. Using the data-fueled predictive models, customer churn was reduced by 5 percent, IBM says. Another case involved an unnamed drink and food retailer with thousands of shops. IBM blended Twitter data with sales tracked on loyalty cards and smartphone apps, as well as employee data. It found that the company’s best customers were the ones most influenced by turnover in the chain’s sales associates. In short, the human touch matters most to your most loyal customers. IBM has plenty of competition in mining social media data for insights. Rivals include big companies like SAS Institute, Adobe, Oracle and Salesforce, and start-ups like Crimson Hexagon and DataSift. IBM’s deal with Twitter is not exclusive. But David Schubmehl, an analyst at IDC, said that more than its competitors, IBM was focused on applying the Twitter data to a wide range of uses, beyond marketing to tasks like churn analysis, talent management and product development. IBM, Mr. Schubmehl said, is ahead of most of its rivals in its knowledge of many industries. “And it’s the combination of internal corporate data and external data from sources like Twitter where the real payoff is going to come from,” he said.\\n\\n\\nApple, banks at odds over who is to blame for high fraud rates on Apple Pay: A raft of headlines over the last week about unusually high fraud rates from thieves using stolen credit numbers on Apple Pay has exposed what many of the banks privately acknowledge they have been trying to fix for months. An industry consultant, Cherian Abraham, put the fraud rate at 6 percent, compared with a traditional credit card fraud rate that is relatively minuscule, 10 cents for every $100 spent. Mr. Abraham wrote in a blog post, one of the first to spotlight the issue, that the Apple Pay fraud “is growing like a weed, and the bank is unable to tell friend from foe. No one is bold enough to call the emperor naked.” It is not clear, however, that Apple is the naked emperor. More likely it is at least as much the banks’ fault, if not more. Apple Pay itself should, in theory, cut down on fraud because it makes stealing credit card information almost impossible. Each time a transaction takes place, Apple generates the equivalent of a new credit card number so the merchant never actually sees a customer’s information. The vulnerability in Apple Pay is in the way that it — and card issuers — “onboard” new credit cards into the system. Because Apple wanted its system to have the simplicity for which it has become famous and wanted to make the sign-up process “frictionless,” the company required little beyond basic credit card information about a user. Nor did it provide much information to the banks, like full phone numbers and addresses, that might help them detect fraud early. The banks, desperate to become their customers’ default card on Apple Pay — most add only one to their iPhones — did little to build their own defenses or to push Apple to provide more detailed information about its customers. Some bank executives acknowledged that they were were so scared of Apple that they didn’t speak up. The banks didn’t press the company for fear that they would not be included among the initial issuers on Apple Pay. Within weeks of Apple Pay’s introduction, a second set of banks joined: Barclays, Navy Federal Credit Union, PNC Bank, USAA and U.S. Bank. It also appears that banks set up a flawed process to deal with the credit cards that it did flag. Affected users were directed to a customer care phone center, not a fraud prevention center. A customer care center’s mission is to help customers use their cards, leading more fraudulent cards to be approved for use on Apple Pay. Call centers are a poor approach for two reasons,” Mr. Abraham wrote. “One — fraudsters are better at social engineering than call center reps are at sniffing out fraud. In some cases, fraudsters are calling the call center themselves to ‘alert the bank about a trip out of town’ so that fraud rules looking for transaction anomalies (like a customer living in California and transacting in Miami) do not trip them up.” Some Apple supporters have sought to discredit Mr. Abraham based on his affiliation as an adviser to a company that is based on Apple’s main competitor, Android. While he may indeed be conflicted, he has rightfully raised an important security issue that all sides have acknowledged is a problem, though perhaps not to the extent he has contended. All of this has led to a thriving black market in which thieves enter stolen credit card numbers into iPhones, essentially turning the devices into physical credit cards, which they in turn take to stores and walk out with merchandise. Thieves have even used Apple Pay at Apple Stores. In a statement, Apple put the problem squarely on the shoulders of the banks: “During setup, Apple Pay requires banks to verify each and every card and the bank then determines and approves whether a card can be added to Apple Pay. Banks are always reviewing and improving their approval process, which varies by bank.” Apple has now begun providing additional information to the banks that should help deter some of the fraud. The banks, which are responsible for the costs of the frauds, have toughened standards to review customer sign-ups on Apple Pay. No bank executive would speak with me on the record for fear of upsetting their company’s relationship with Apple. If you’re asking yourself, “Why are criminals more inclined to use Apple Pay than just use stolen credit cards at an online retailer?” it’s a good question. It is apparently much easier for banks to catch thieves using stolen credit cards with online retailers because of the delay in shipping a product — it can often take days — as well as the extra information that every online retailer requires, like an address where the product is to be shipped.\\n\\n\\nOracle quarterly earnings: revenue $9.33B, 0% Y/Y. Shares up 1.7% on dividend hike, strong PaaS revenues: Oracle Corp. reported fiscal third-quarter sales that missed analysts’ estimates, hurt by a rise in the U.S. dollar and weak corporate demand for cloud software. Revenue in the period that ended Feb. 28 was little changed from a year earlier at $9.33 billion, and profit before certain costs was 68 cents a share, the Redwood City, California-based company said Tuesday in a statement. On average, analysts projected $9.47 billion in sales and profit of 68 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Without the effect of the stronger dollar, revenue would have gained 6 percent, Oracle said, sparking optimism that the company is making headway with its push into corporate cloud services and sending the shares up in extended trading.  The software maker also boosted its dividend by 25 percent to 15 cents a share, up from the prior payout of 12 cents. The company last raised its dividend in 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Oracle shares rose 1.7 percent in late trading following the report and dividend increase. The stock fell 1.2 percent to $42.87 at the close in New York, leaving it down 4.7 percent this year. Third-quarter net income fell to $2.5 billion, or 56 cents a share, from $2.57 billion, or 56 cents, a year earlier. Combined sales in Oracle’s cloud software, platform-as-a-service -- known as PaaS -- and infrastructure businesses were $527 million, up 29 percent from $408 million a year earlier. The company started disclosing cloud revenue in June. In the long term, Oracle’s transition to the cloud should benefit the bottom line, Catz said on the conference call. “For every million dollars of license we sell, we expect to collect another million dollars of support over five years for a total of $2 million,” she said. “While for every million of PaaS we sell, we actually expect to collect $5 million over five years.”\\n\\n\\nAdobe quarterly earnings: revenue $1.11B, shares slide 3.8% on weakness in cloud sales: Adobe shares fell late Tuesday after the company reported lower-than-expected subscription growth for its Creative Cloud service and forecast second-quarter earnings and revenue below analysts’ estimates. Adobe increased its Creative Cloud subscriptions 28 percent to 517,000 in the fiscal first quarter, missing the 575,000 average of two analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company projected second-quarter sales of $1.125 billion to $1.175 billion and profit, excluding some items, of 41 cents to 47 cents a share. Analysts expected $1.18 billion and 48 cents, according to the average of 19 estimates. Adobe has introduced cloud-based marketing and creative-design tools as part of its push to generate more sales from subscriptions instead of software installed on computers. Revenue and profit declined in 2013, the year after the transition began, but have recovered as customers are getting used to the new way of buying software. “People are realizing they don’t necessarily need the full suite,” said Norman Young, an analyst with Morningstar Inc., who has a hold rating on the stock. “Our worry is, how are they going to raise prices over time and get people to move over from the point solutions to the full suite?” To encourage people to buy more products, Adobe will add more services, such as stock photos from Fotolia, a company it acquired last quarter. The new offerings should lead to a boost in revenue per user “this year” from that integration, Chief Financial Officer Mark Garrett said in an interview. Adobe fell 3.8 percent to $76.66 in extended trading at 7:25 p.m. New York time. The San Jose, California-based company had gained 17 percent in the past 12 months through the close. Sales were $1.11 billion and profit, excluding some items, was 44 cents a share in the period ended Feb. 27, Adobe said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts had on average projected revenue of $1.09 billion and profit of 39 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\\n\\n\\nRumor negates rumor: Alibaba may not invest in Snapdeal: Alibaba may scrap plans to invest in Indian online marketplace Snapdeal, technology website Recode reported, citing a person who was familiar with the matter. Last week, a person informed about the deal had told Reuters that Alibaba was in talks with Snapdeal over a potential cash investment in what could have been the Chinese e-commerce giant\\'s first direct investment in India. Alibaba has held discussions with Snapdeal about a possible investment, but the Chinese company is leaning away from investing in Snapdeal right now, Recode said. Snapdeal competes in India with bigger rivals Flipkart.com and Amazon.com, and media reports had said it was seeking $1 billion in its latest funding round to fuel growth. Alibaba and Snapdeal\\'s talks, however, did not involve a deal close to the $1 billion number reported, Recode cited the source as saying.\\n\\n\\nPinterest valued at $11B on new round of fund-raising: Less than a year after being valued at $5 billion, Pinterest has joined the 11-digit valuation start-up club. Pinterest, an online scrapbooking service, disclosed on Monday that it raised about $367 million in a new round of financing from new and existing investors. It valued the company at $11 billion, putting the start-up in roughly the same range as the Silicon Valley darling Dropbox and the data analysis company Palantir Technologies. In a regulatory filing, Pinterest disclosed that it could raise as much as $211 million in additional financing, bringing its potential haul to $578 million. That would be on top of the $764 million that the nearly five-year-old start-up has raised in previous rounds. Interest has been so ardent that the start-up has nearly tripled its valuation in just about a year and a half. Pinterest has shown strides in expanding and developing revenue, especially with so-called promoted pins that advertisers can buy. Advertising will continue to be a main focus this year, company executives have said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba founder demos facial recognition payments: Alibaba is working on a new technology called “Smile To Pay” that will allow users to make mobile payments by simply scanning their face. It would basically work the same way as Apple Pay does with fingerprints, where users can approve mobile payments with a single tap on the home button — only, Alibaba wants to replace fingerprints with the user’s face. At Cebit in Hanover, Alibaba founder Jack Ma, after noting how online payments can sometimes be troublesome, the founder took out his smartphone and paid for a set of stamps on Alibaba using face-recognition technology. Alibaba has been open about its plans to release face recognition-enabled payments for Alipay, its third-party payment service, at least since October of last year.\\n\\n\\nTripAdvisor reviews affect tourism of entire countries, hotel revenues:\\xa0TripAdvisor is the biggest travel reviews website in the world. Today, TripAdvisor lists over 890,000 hotels, holds one of the largest collections of travel photos on the internet, and features accommodation in more than 45 countries. It makes nearly $1 billion in revenue a year and boasts more than 60 million members. Customers of hotels, restaurants, and other attractions add 115 comments to the site every minute, writes Tom Vanderbilt on Outside Online. The site is now so big that its reviews can shift the tourist economies of entire countries, Vanderbilt says. Social media and TripAdvisor have together forced hotel owners to do more than rely on nice photos and clever branding to entice customers, Vanderbilt writes. And that is changing the hotel economies of entire countries.\\xa0Ireland:\\xa0\\xa0The standout discovery is that as Irish hotel managers took action to garner good reviews on TripAdvisor, their hotels actually got better. And as they did, responses also improved — and visitors arrived more frequently.\\xa0UK:\\xa0User-generated content was “directly related to £1.7 billion of tourism spending in the UK,” Big Hospitality reports. In 2012, that figure made up around 2.2% of all tourist spending.\\xa0 Studies found that reviews even Affect hotels’ “RevPAR,” or revenue per available room. Every positive percentage point a place rises up the tables in TripAdvisor, RevPAR at locations increases by 1.4%. Vanderbilt explains that as a result, hotels can raise prices by 11% to reflect their reputation on the site.\\n\\n\\nYoutube retools annotations for mobile\\xa0:\\xa0Youtube is finally retooling a troublesome feature, making it more useful for content producers and hopefully a bit less frustrating for users. Annotations, YouTube\\'s clickable pop-ups (which, to be clear, are still available for the moment) are being joined in the company\\'s toolbox by a new feature called \"cards,\" which, to every advertiser\\'s delight (and most users\\' chagrin) will now work on mobile. The good news is that cards will take up a relatively minimal amount of video real estate when they first appear, showing teaser text that, if clicked, will pop up more information. At later points in the clip, a small \"i\" will indicate the presence of cards.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nLyft plans to be profitable by 2016, targests $2.7 B topline and reduced driver acquisition spends\\xa0: Last week on-demand transportation service Lyft announced that it had raised $530 million in new funding as it seeks to steal market share away from arch-rival Uber and launch services in new markets in the U.S. and internationally. While it is clearly second to Uber in both markets it serves and financing it’s raised, Lyft’s financial projections at least show a path to profitability in the next 24 months. This year Lyft is targeting nearly $1.2 billion in gross revenues, of which its take will be around $300 million net. That assumes between 20 and 25 percent commission for the rides it books. In 2016, Lyft expects its revenues to more than double(targeting $2.7 billion). That revenue growth is driven by an increase in the number of rides and passengers that Lyft serves. The company is targeting nearly 90 million rides in total for 2015, which it expects to more than double to 205 million in the year following. While Lyft is generating a lot of cash, it also has a number of costs associated with running the business, including credit card processing fees, insurance, and taxes. After those costs, Lyft forecasts a $170 million gross profit in 2015, which it expects to grow to about $400 million in 2016. That said, its gross profit number doesn’t take into account Lyft’s customer and driver acquisition costs, which the company is using to prime the pump and grow both supply and demand. In 2015, Lyft expects to spend $150 million to acquire new users, while spending an additional $50 million on getting drivers on board to shuttle them around. Taking those numbers into account, there’s a delta of around $30 million between its gross profit and acquisition costs this year. In 2016, the financial picture gets a little better: While gross profit is expected to grow to around $400 million, its spend on driver and passenger acquisition is forecast to increase only slightly, to around $250 million.\\n\\n\\nSnapdeal in talks to buy Jabong’s spun out logistics unit GoJavas for $32M:\\xa0\\xa0Online marketplace major Snapdeal is in talks to acquire logistics firm GoJavas in a deal estimated to be about Rs 150-200 crore, as it looks to further strengthen its delivery operations in the country. GoJavas, which works with eCommerce firms like HealthKart, Jabong, Yepme and Lenskart, covers over 2,500 pincodes in the country. Currently, Snapdeal does not have a captive delivery arm and relies on third-party logistics.\\n\\n\\nAnother CFO retires (after Google, Apple, Amazon)\\xa0:\\xa0Uber CFO steps down:\\xa0Brent Callinicos, the chief financial officer of Uber, plans to leave the ride-sharing company, in what will be one of the highest-level departures yet for the six-year-old start-up. Mr. Callinicos’s departure comes just two years after he joined Uber, according to an internal memo to employees obtained by The New York Times, where he helped the company expand from a young start-up to span more than 53 countries. The move comes on the heels of a spree of fund-raising activity for Uber. It also comes amid a spate of chief financial officer retirements at some of the largest companies in Silicon Valley over the past year. But perhaps most important, Mr. Callinicos’s departure comes shortly after Uber arranged a private sale of convertible debt, managed by Goldman Sachs. The terms of this offering, as described by people briefed on the matter, give Uber an incentive to go public within the next few years. The securities being offered to Goldman’s clients can be converted into stock — at a discount of roughly 20 to 30 percent of Uber’s valuation in an initial stock offering.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nNon-compete agreements drive away talent, Silicon Valley thrives in their absence:\\xa0\\xa0In Silicon Valley,\\xa0 Not only are formal alliances commonplace among the local firms, it is also, arguably, one of the most dynamic labour markets in the world. Here, the culture is one of loyalty to the profession rather than to a firm. Equally, there is nowhere else on the globe that can compete with the number of start-ups which successfully launch and, more importantly, stay in business and go on to be global leaders in the industry.\\xa0 But what drives this collaborative environment? Silicon Valley’s vibrancy can’t all be pinned down to one factor.\\xa0However, one critical characteristic of Californian is that firms simply cannot enforce non-compete agreements on their employees – as the state doesn’t recognise them legally. There \\xa0is clear evidence that talented workers feel a pull towards states where they can change employers freely and take their creativity with them.\\xa0 In today’s collaborative business environment, this raises some questions about whether non-competes really are the best tool for protecting intellectual property and recouping technological investments even from the perspective of the companies involved.\\xa0 It is important to recognise that these are a double-edged sword.\\xa0 Preventing employees from going to work for a competitor could not only hurt your competitor, but it could be hurting your own business too if one looks at the bigger picture.\\xa0 Because finding the right match between an employee and employer is a little like the dating game — some are matches are made in heaven, some are not — and it is beneficial to be able to break the relationship as easily as possible, should the need arise. If, however, your own employees and your competitor’s employees are unable to find the right match for fear of breaking a contract, the only outcome is a zero-sum game.\\xa0 In this situation, the degree of experimentation between employees and firms becomes that much harder, leading to an inefficient labour market. As well as being detrimental at firm level, the consequences are felt across the industry and region.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRumor of the day: Snapdeal in advanced talks to buy Freecharge for INR 2800 crores: Snapdeal is reportedly in advance talks to buy online recharge company Freecharge for Rs 2,800 crore. Freecharge, which allows users to recharge their pre-paid phones and get an equal value discount coupon, has emerged as a popular recharge option and a head-on competitor of PayTM, which recently attracted investment from Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. Freecharge has raised multiple rounds of funding. In February 2015, it raised $80 million from San Francisco-based hedge fund Valiant Capital Management and Hong Kong-based Tybourne Capital Management along with Sequoia Capital, RuNet and Sofina Capital. In September 2014, the company had mobilised $33 million from Sequoia Capital, Sofina and RuNet. It had also raised Rs 20 crore from Sequoia Capital in 2011. If the deal goes through, this will the largest acquisition in the Indian e-commerce space . It will even trump Flipkart\\'s acquisition of fashion e-tailer Myntra last year for a whopping $370 million. If the acquisition comes through, there are several reasons it will make sense for Snapdeal, the leader in the marketplace business. Snapdeal will ride on Freecharge\\'s growing popularity and its huge user base of over 20 million users. Freecharge works with upwards of 300-odd retailers, selling their discount coupons and processes recharges worth over Rs 100 crore per month. For most mobile recharge companies like Freecharge, PayTM, Mobikwik or Oxigen, mobile recharge is a very thin margin product but has worked well to grab a massive user base. Having scaled up to a few million, these companies have used their customer base as launch pads for a host of other services, including DTH recharges, utility bill payments, online shopping, bus ticket bookings, movie bookings and ordering from fast-food chains such as Dominos and Pizza Hut. For instance, Oxigen Services (India), launched in 2004 as a mobile recharge venture, now does Rs 600 crore worth of transactions per month - the biggest chunk of its business comprising money transfers (Rs 200 crore), followed by recharges (Rs 100 crore) and bill payments (Rs 30 crore) The deal will help Snapdeal diversify into a host of other online services, get more retailers onboard and provide it an edge over its emerging competitor in the marketplace model -- PayTM, now backed by Alibaba\\'s might. Also, since mobile is the most important leg of growth, this acquisition will make the Snapdeal brand resonate better on mobile phones.\\n\\n\\nNot topical, but interesting: A well-known link on Top 12 Product Management Mistakes:  1.

Currently these YouTube videos can only be viewed on Google Chrome and in YouTube’s Android app. YouTube says it’s working on compatibility for iOS devices and other Web browsers. The videos are a step toward virtual reality, offering an 2D-immersive experience in which a user can pan around a video with their mouse. It’s similar to the experience of Google Maps’ Street View function, except with video not photos. Viewers will no longer be locked to a fixed perspective. For now, uploaders of 360-degree videos will need to run a script on their video to add metadata so YouTube recognizes it as a 360-degree video. YouTube is working to automate this step. The viewing experience is especially neat for an Android user in the YouTube app. If you move your phone from side to side, the perspective will shift. Makers of 360-degree cameras expect these videos to soon be ubiquitous. “Similar to Flip driving the popularity of YouTube video and the idea of sharing, 360-degree cameras and technology take video as we know it to the next level,” said Paul Meyhoefer, vice president of marketing at JK Imaging Ltd, maker of the Kodak SP360. YouTube will support uploads from 360-cameras such as the Bublcam, IC Real Tech’s Allie, Kodak’s SP360 and the Ricoh Theta. The cameras are fairly expensive — ranging from about $300 to $700, but they should become cheaper in time.\\n\\n\\nLyft Raises $530M at $#2.5B valuation: Uber, the ride-hailing start-up, is a $40 billion juggernaut, but it is not without competition. Lyft, another ride-hailing start-up and Uber’s biggest competitor in the United States, announced on Thursday that it had raised $530 million in venture capital, valuing the start-up at $2.5 billion. The investment was led by Rakuten, the Japanese e-commerce giant, which contributed more than $300 million.\\n\\n\\nChina puts tech bill that concerns West on hold: U.S. official: China has put a hold on a draft counter-terrorism law that would require technology firms to hand over sensitive information to government officials, a senior U.S. official said in a good sign for Western businesses who saw the rule as a major impediment to working in the world\\'s second largest economy. President Barack Obama said in an interview with Reuters on March 2 that he had raised concerns about the law directly with Chinese President Xi Jinping. \"They have decided to suspend the third reading of that particular law, which has sort of put that on hiatus for the moment,\" White House Cybersecurity Coordinator Michael Daniel said on Thursday, according to a webcast of a discussion at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. \"We did see that as something that was bad not just for U.S. business but for the global economy as a whole, and it was something we felt was very important to communicate very clearly to them,\" Daniel said. It was not clear whether the bill would proceed or not. China Central Television reported on March 9 that Wang Aili, a senior official with the Chinese National People\\'s Congress Standing Committee\\'s legislative affairs commission, said the bill was not on the schedule for the NPC\\'s annual session, which began last week. A third reading and vote would be scheduled in \"due time,\" he said. The law would require technology firms to hand over encryption keys, the passcodes that help protect data, and install security \"backdoors\" in their systems to give Chinese authorities surveillance access. One industry source, who requested anonymity, said the move gave companies \"some breathing room, but not complete relief\" because the bill could be picked up again at any point as only the standing committee — not the full parliament – was needed to pass a law. But another was optimistic that was the end of the matter. \"The Chinese are not ready to kick out all foreign companies, and because they weren’t ready to take that step, they backed off,\" said a U.S. technology industry expert, who asked not to be identified to avoid complicating his employer\\'s dealings in China. \"You can bet that the next steps will be something that tightens up somewhere but doesn’t cause this level of pain.\" The initial draft, published by the NPC late last year, requires companies to also keep servers and user data within China, supply law enforcement authorities with communications records and censor terrorism-related Internet content.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

While they rely on technology to deliver new products and services, their business models are a departure from the low-cost ventures built by a few programmers working in a cramped office. Instead, they\\'re setting up kitchens, renting warehouses and hiring local staff. Among the startups that raised a third financing round in 2013 or 2014, 14 are expanding from city to city and have attracted an average of $65 million in funding, more than double the amount raised by the rest, according to PitchBook Data, a financial information provider. Uber is leading the pack, with a presence in almost 300 cities in 55 countries. Valued at $40 billion, the mobile car-hailing startup is on a hiring spree for operations staff, with more than 200 job postings for staff outside of the company\\'s headquarters in San Francisco, from Miami to Moscow. CEO Travis Kalanick\\'s steady ramp-up has required Uber to raise an enormous amount of cash totaling more than $5 billion. In January, Bloomberg News reported the car-booking startup raised $1.6 billion in convertible debt, and that it was still on the lookout to collect more financing. Some investors warn that cash-intensive startups are at risk of flopping, pointing to previous attempts by delivery companies Kozmo.com and Webvan, which also sought to expand city to city in the late 1990s, only to crash when the dot-com bubble burst in the new millennium. Marc Andreessen, Silicon Valley investor and startup veteran, cautioned last year that enterprises rapidly burning cash may be unable to survive in an adverse environment.1 Apoorva Mehta, Instacart\\'s CEO, is betting his delivery startup will be nimble enough to avert a crunch. The San Francisco-based company, which raised $220 million at a $2 billion valuation in January, initially sold groceries to customers with a markup. Now, Instacart is more focused on cutting deals with food stores to deliver produce and other goods for a fee. Instacart needs less cash to expand (compared with Amazon, which also delivers groceries in some urban areas) since it doesn\\'t have to build warehouses or large stores. \"You have an operations team that is on a city-by-city basis, but you make sure your engineering team is not city-by-city,\" Mehta said.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba hiring in Amazon, Microsoft backyard as U.S. cloud unit expands: Alibaba has begun hunting staff in Seattle, home turf of Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp, focusing on savvy cloud computing hires as it ramps up U.S. operations. Several recruiters in the region said they had registered the firm\\'s hiring drive, suggesting Alibaba is eyeing staff at rival Amazon as well as Microsoft and Facebook Inc. According to LinkedIn\\'s data, Alibaba has already hired staff away from Microsoft and Amazon. LinkedIn data list Microsoft as the top company from which former employees have joined Alibaba, not specifying the location of the hires, with 20 recruits for unspecified posts at the Chinese company having previously worked at the software giant. With the job openings Alibaba joins the increasingly fierce fight for cloud computing talent in Silicon Valley and Seattle, where it opened a research and development center in what is Microsoft and Amazon\\'s backyard late last year. The Chinese company\\'s arrival on the tech job market is - for now - unlikely to pose a concern to major industry incumbents, who in past years have resorted to increasingly imaginative tactics to recruit scant human resources. Alibaba\\'s moves in the region are at an early stage, and the amount of hiring still comparatively low, said recruiters. The company has fewer than 300 employees in the United States. But Alibaba is looking at Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook in the Seattle area for new blood, particularly developers, said Jerry Taylor, president of Executive Recruiters Inc in Bellevue, Washington. \"I\\'m sure they\\'re going to be web-based as well as mobile-type folks,\" he said. \"They\\'re trying to get a footprint in the United States. What better place to go than their direct competitor in Amazon?\" An Alibaba spokesman declined to give details of recruitment. Alibaba\\'s talent hunt coincides with a broader push in the United States this year to win over U.S. business, offering American retailers new ways to sell to China\\'s vast and growing middle class. On March 4 it launched a cloud computing hub in Silicon Valley, its first outside of China. Alibaba has hired at least 10 software engineers or computing experts from either Microsoft or Amazon since July 2014, all but one based in the greater Seattle area, according to their LinkedIn profiles. Li Xiaolong, one of the 10 and a senior staff engineer at Alibaba, openly advertises for like-minded talent on his profile: \"We are actively hiring talents in machine learning, data mining and distributed computing, as well as hardcore software engineers to improve the world\\'s biggest e-commerce platform. The location can be Seattle, Silicon Valley, Beijing or Hangzhou.\"\\n\\n\\nBrands Are Now Posting More to Instagram Than Facebook Photo app is marketers\\' new fave: Instagram is luring brands away from Facebook, according to a new report from research firm L2, which found that brands now post more content on the photo-sharing app. The reason? Brands know everything they post on the platform will appear in fans\\' feeds, the study says. But on Facebook, if brands don\\'t pay to promote their posts, much of their content doesn\\'t appear in followers\\' News Feeds. That trend is turning Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, into a growing marketing force.  The report outlines how brands have been building their followings on the app, which recently topped 300 million monthly users. Facebook does not comment on Instagram\\'s growth outside of official announcements. However, considering the Instagram audience was 100 million two years ago, that tripling of users approaches Facebook\\'s biggest leaps. Facebook went from 100 million to 300 million in an even shorter time span. Another reason Instagram is a marketing darling at the moment is it\\'s attracting younger users than Facebook, according to L2. While an estimated 3 million U.S. teens abandoned Facebook between 2011 and 2014, the same demographic now cites Instagram as \"the most important\" social network, the report says. UPDATE: The survey focused on 250 of the world\\'s top brands, and Facebook counts more than 2 million advertisers. Here\\'s a look at what else L2 and Olapic, the social marketing technology firm, found: Brands post an average of 9.3 times a week to Instagram, up from 7.5 posts a year ago. Facebook posts decreased, meanwhile, from 11.1 to 8.8 per week. Brand fan bases rose an average of 26 percent over the past year. Photos perform better than videos. Users engage with photos 1.03 percent of the time and with videos 0.79 percent of the time. Instagram\\'s Hyperlapse app, which speeds up video into fast-motion action, has fallen out of favor with just 2.4 percent of brands using it since its August launch.\\n\\n\\nF.C.C. Sets Net Neutrality Rules: The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday released extensive details of how it would regulate broadband Internet providers as a public utility, producing official wording that almost certainly sets the stage for extended legal fights. The release of the rules had been eagerly anticipated by advocates and lawmakers, as well as broadband and technology companies, since the agency approved new rules for Internet service two weeks ago. The details came in a 313-page document that included the new rules and the legal justifications for them. The rules revealed how the strict laws would be modified for Internet providers, exempting the companies from the sort of price controls typically applied to utilities, for example. But the full text of the new order also raised uncertainties about broad and subjective regulation. One catchall provision, requiring “just and reasonable” conduct, allows the F.C.C. to decide what is acceptable on a case-by-case basis. Opponents of the rules, including many of the leading Internet providers, spent Thursday poring over the document. It was not known who would file the first legal challenges, or exactly what legal arguments would be made. Many experts, though, said the document included plenty of opportunity for different interpretations. The “just and reasonable” provision, said Roger Entner, the lead analyst at Recon Analytics in Boston, “can be stretched like chewing gum.” He suggested that it would inspire a flood of proactive, permission-seeking petitions from businesses large and small. He pointed to mobile-messaging companies like Snapchat or WhatsApp that may be transmitting voice or video and seeking money from investors who want legal assurances before signing checks. “Before acting, you need to know: Is this kosher with the F.C.C.?” The debate about how to preserve the open Internet has persisted for more than a decade, and the F.C.C.’s new rules are not its first attempt to protect it. But the issue picked up momentum in the last year, with President Obama taking the unusual action of publicly urging the independent agency to approve strong regulation. The agency’s order reclassifies high-speed Internet as a telecommunications service rather than an information one, subjecting providers to regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. Its aim is to protect the open Internet, advancing principles of so-called net neutrality by prohibiting broadband providers from elevating one kind of content over another. “Threats to Internet openness remain today,” the agency wrote in the document released on Thursday. “The record reflects that broadband providers hold all the tools necessary to deceive consumers, degrade content or disfavor the content that they don’t like.” Comcast and Verizon, two leading Internet service providers, declined to comment. Jim Cicconi, AT&T’s senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs, called the order’s publication the beginning of “a period of uncertainty” that the company was confident would be resolved “by bipartisan action by Congress or a future F.C.C., or by the courts.”\\n\\n\\nEducational toy maker LeapFrog, once unique, is battered by the app disruption: Battered by a growing variety of cheaper alternatives, LeapFrog, a dominant maker of educational toys and games, has watched its sales plummet. It has become the target of short-sellers, investors who bet on a company’s failures, and was most recently sued by shareholders who claimed it had drastically overestimated consumer demand for its products. “As each year passes by and more apps are for free and they’re lower priced, it becomes a tougher sell,” said Jim Silver, the editor in chief of TTPM, a toy review website. Slow to adapt, critics say, LeapFrog has become something of a modern-day fable for how quickly technology has unseated the toy industry’s titans. Mike Wood, a lawyer, created the company upon realizing how few educational products existed for his 3-year-old son, who was having trouble learning to read. He founded the company in 1995, and in 1999 introduced the first LeapPad, an electronic book with audio and pen that helped children learn to read. As technology evolved, LeapFrog seized the opportunity to create a tablet just for children: no web-browsing abilities and a limited set of games. It introduced the original LeapPad tablet in 2011 for $100 at a time when the average tablet in the United States sold for about $470, according to data from Euromonitor. Sales skyrocketed. Sean McGowan, an analyst with Needham and Company, estimates that the company sold 1.2 million tablets the first year, and more than doubled that in 2012, when the LeapPad 2 came out. The hardware, combined with its software and content, most likely made up more than half of the company’s revenue, Mr. McGowan said. “Back then, not every family had an adult tablet they were willing to give to their child,” said Gerrick Johnson, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets. Just a few years later, however, the idea of a tablet that appeals precisely because it can do a limited set of tasks seems almost quaint. Older generations of iPads have become hand-me-downs from parents to children, while tablets get cheaper every year. Parents can program their grown-up devices with educational games, instead of buying a separate specialized system. Sales of various LeapPads to retailers began to plateau in 2013, according to Mr. McGowan, who estimates that they dropped more than 40 percent in 2014. On a weekday afternoon, Flora Bojadziev, a chef from Harlem, browsed through a Toys “R” Us in Manhattan. She was looking for educational toys for her 2 ½-year-old son, who plays with her iPad. But she balked at the idea of spending $130 on LeapFrog’s LeapPad Ultra XDi, an educational tablet for children, on sale in the aisle a few steps away. “With that money, I’ll buy him so many apps,” said Ms. Bojadziev, who is 33. That is precisely the problem for LeapFrog, which built a multimillion-dollar company on children’s devices before babies learned to swipe the screens of iPads.\\n\\n\\nIntel cuts revenue forecast as desktop demand weakens - shares down 5%: Intel Corp (INTC.O) slashed nearly $1 billion from its first-quarter revenue forecast as small businesses put off upgrading their personal computers, sending the chipmaker\\'s shares down more than 5 percent. Fewer companies than Intel had expected replaced desktop PCs running on outdated Microsoft operating systems, leading to weak demand for its chips. Intel also cited \"challenging\" macroeconomic and currency conditions, particularly in Europe. \"The macro environment is not robust enough for people to upgrade their PCs the way they normally would,\" Topeka Capital Markets analyst Suji De Silva said. Intel said on Thursday that it expected first-quarter revenue of $12.8 billion, plus or minus $300 million - about 7 percent lower than its earlier forecast of $13.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Though dominant in the market for chips used in PCs, Intel has been slower than rivals such as Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) to adjust in recent years to the growing popularity of smartphones. When Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) wound down support for its Windows XP operating system last April, Intel had expected a bounce in demand from small- and medium-sized businesses. But this has not happened. Businesses and consumers are taking an \"if it ain\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it\" attitude to their old PCs, Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan said. According to BlueFin Research Partners, 75 million-76 million PCs will be shipped worldwide in the first quarter, a decline of 8-9 percent from the preceding quarter. Intel, whose historic \"Wintel\" alliance with Microsoft once delivered breathtakingly high profit margins, has been trying to offset the impact of slower PC upgrades by making chips for devices such as \"2-in-1s\", which function as both laptop and tablet. Intel said the mid-point of its gross margin range would remain at 60 percent, plus or minus a couple of percentage points. Intel\\'s shares were down 4.8 percent at $30.76 in late afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHot Billion $ News :Alibaba is investing $200 million in Snapchat at $15 billion valuation – after it declined 3B offer from facebook:\\xa0With the latest deal, Snapchat would be ranked behind only mobile car-booking application Uber Technologies Inc. and Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp., according to data compiled by researcher CB Insights. Xiaomi is pegged at $45 billion, while Uber’s latest round valued it at $40 billion. Snapchat lets people take and draw on photos, then send them to select friends or add them to a public “story.” The photos and videos disappear seconds after the recipient views them. The company says its users -- the app is popular among teens -- send more than 700 million disappearing “snaps” and view more than 500 million stories daily. Evan Spiegel started Snapchat in a Stanford University fraternity house in 2011 and turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook Inc. in 2013. He raised funds from 23 investors at a $10 billion valuation last year. That increase has corresponded with a surge in venture spending to the highest level in more than a decade. Venture capitalists pumped $48.3 billion into U.S. companies last year, according to data from the National Venture Capital Association and PricewaterhouseCoopers.\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle launched a cheap cloud storage service – promises data retrieval in 3 secs:\\xa0Google is offering a new kind of data storage service called Nearline, for non-essential data. Like an AWS product called Glacier, this storage costs just a penny a month per gigabyte. Microsoft’s cheapest listed online storage is about 2.4 cents a gigabyte. While Glacier storage has a retrieval time of several hours, though, Google said Nearline data will be available in about three seconds. The name is meant to evoke the idea of being nearly online at all times, It is also designed to move easily into other Google storage products, with sub-second data retrieval. That could make it a way to sell more expensive storage, as well as more analytics tools. Google’s long game, in other words, is positioning itself as the cloud computing company for all kinds of data analysis, something that it at the heart of its search engine business.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstagram new marketer’s fave –teens cite its \"the most important\" social network”:\\xa0Instagram is luring brands away from Facebook, according to a new report from research firm L2, which found that brands now post more content on the photo-sharing app.The reason?

While an estimated 3 million U.S. teens abandoned Facebook between 2011 and 2014, the same demographic now cites Instagram as \"the most important\" social network, the report says.\\n\\n\\n\\nHot Billion $ Rumor#1 :\\xa0Google may buy InMobi for $1B:\\xa0Google Inc is in early talks to buy Bangalore-based start-up InMobi, in a move that would strengthen its offering in the increasingly competitive mobile advertising space, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.InMobi, which helps companies target phones and mobile devices in their advertising, was launched in 2007 and claims to have over 1 billion users across 200 countries. It counts Japan\\'s SoftBank, an early backer of China\\'s Alibaba, and early stage venture capital firm Sherpalo among investors.\\n\\n\\n\\nHot Billion $ Rumor#2:\\xa0Snapdeal might raise $ 700 million from Foxconn(Taiwan):\\xa0Snapdeal.com, has attracted interest from Taiwan-based Foxconn Technology Group, one of the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturing firms, to raise as much as $600-700 million in a fresh round of funding, at least two sources familiar with the matter told Techcircle.in. However, the talks are still at a preliminary stage and the company is yet to issue a term sheet. “Foxconn is world’s biggest contract electronics manufacturer. But they are now finding new growth drivers as revenue from the contract manufacturing business is slowing down. India being a huge retail market, this is a great opportunity for them,” said one of the persons mentioned above.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline retail had a bumper year ($326.6 billion), key to 2015 success: Payments, CustomerFirst, Data:Overall, the retail industry posted solid growth last year and e-commerce really knocked it out of the park. Total retail sales reached approximately $4.12 trillion in 2014 and online retail made up about 7.9% of that ($326.6 billion). Compared to 2013, 2014 “nonstore retailers” sales, which includes e-commerce, grew by 7.7%. The last quarter of 2014 was strong for e-commerce, as online sales increased by 2.3% between Q3 and Q4. After being adjusted for seasonal variance, the US Department of Commerce estimates that online retailers sold $79.6 billion worth of goods. This made up 6.7% of total retail sales, which reached $1.2 trillion.\\xa0Tips for this year:\\xa0Increase Payment Options: About 54% of shoppers like having the option to use payment methods beyond credit and debit. This often boils down to security concerns. Consider offering alternative payment options, such as PayPal, to give customers choices and make them feel safer.\\xa0Put the Customer First:\\xa0Approximately 83% of consumers require some sort of customer support while making an online purchase and if you can deliver, you’ll reap the benefits. Roughly 86% of consumers said they’d pay more for a good customer experience, and that is possible through live chat. Be clear on what shoppers are looking for, provide helpful recommendations, and answer questions in real time.\\xa0Use Data Effectively: There are different kinds of data, and even more ways to use them. Even though it can be overwhelming, it is crucial for e-commerce success. It can allow retailers to provide a more personalized experience and target shoppers better when they abandon their cart. Know what they’ve added to their carts and use those items to remind them to come back. Provide great recommendations based on what they’ve previously ordered to create loyal customers. Data can even give retailers a better idea of what price is best on products based on the competitive landscape, demand, and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook to give away designs of servers and networking at its Data Centers, Cisco and Dell are feeling the heat: Facebook’s plan to change big computing is moving fast and is attracting more companies to its plans. The company announced on Tuesday that it would give away designs of two crucial elements of its enormous computing centers, both computer servers and networking. These designs and others like them will be offered as products from several other manufacturers, along with a significant amount of supporting software from other companies. Facebook also noted that its designs had saved the company $2 billion in the last three years, compared with using conventional computing equipment. If the new designs become popular, it could mean new pain for the large incumbent computer-hardware makers, like Cisco and Dell, which for several years have faced inroads from open-source software. The Facebook products involve both hardware and software. A Facebook executive said much of the difference in the way Facebook designs computing systems comes from its huge data flows, both internally and from users on desktop computers and mobile phones. While few companies now handle Facebook-heft computation, expectations are for huge loads to become commonplace at many companies. “It’s hardware that better fits the workloads and software,” said Jason Taylor, vice president of computer infrastructure at Facebook. “There are thousands of companies with these needs.” He said the new designs could be interesting to any company spending more than $10 million a year on computing — a not exceptional amount for a large company. The two designs are being open-sourced through the Open Compute Project, which Mark Zuckerberg helped start to lower his costs and catch up with giants like Google and Amazon Web Services in building global computing infrastructures. Open-source projects can help a company like Facebook in a couple of ways. In the design phase of a project, having outsiders examine work can mean unexpected improvements and bug fixes. If the product becomes successful, Facebook gets the benefits of lower prices from higher production. “Supply chains get healthier if there is more demand,” Mr. Taylor said. “It’s an advantage” for Facebook. One of the products Facebook is donating to the Open Compute Project is a recently developed networking switch with a modular design that enables smaller switches to create larger ones. Switches are the way data moves between computer servers in a rack, and between the racks inside a data center. Accton, a Taiwanese maker of networking gear, is expected to sell a version of the switch later this year. In addition, two other companies making switching software, Cumulus Networks and Big Switch Networks, are donating software to the project. Facebook is donating switch management software that it has developed. The other Facebook donation is a new version of a low-power server that uses a special semiconductor from Intel. Up to 192 of the chips can be fit into a single rack of servers at relatively low power consumption but high performance.\\n\\n\\nWhy does a company with hundreds of billions in cash raise debt? Because it can - Apple has timed the bond market superbly, calling market tops, but at the expense of its bond buyers: Apple Inc., as it turns out, knows the bond market too. The company has an uncanny ability to raise money in debt markets right before interest rates go up. That means buyers are often left with losses. Take the iPhone maker’s $6.5 billion debt sale on Feb. 2. Those notes have already lost more than $230 million of value through Monday. And remember the company’s record-breaking $17 billion bond sale in April 2013, sold just three days before Treasury yields began the biggest two-month surge in a decade? “When they decide to go to market, they’re watching for whenever there’s a potential inflection point forming,” said Jody Lurie, a corporate credit analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia. “They have a feeling that something’s going to happen.” The reason for the decline in Apple’s bonds isn’t a repudiation of the Apple Watch’s success or the company’s ability to come up with new products. Instead, it underscores the risks investors are taking in a market that’s become about the most sensitive ever to moves in U.S. government debt yields. U.S. Treasuries have declined 2.7 percent since the end of January, with notes maturing in more than 15 years falling 8.8 percent, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. The $2 billion of 30-year notes that Apple sold last month have fallen to 92.2 cents on the dollar from 99.1 cents at issuance. More generally, Apple’s dollar-denominated bonds have lost more than 3 percent since the end of January, compared with 1.8 percent of losses on Bank of America’s index of U.S. investment-grade corporates. With plenty of cash on its balance sheet, Apple certainly doesn’t need to borrow extra money to support its business. Instead, it has the luxury of waiting until yields get so low that the top-rated company would practically be financially irresponsible not to borrow money The company doesn’t even have to use the proceeds to invest in new products or pay back existing debt; Apple can simply funnel the cash raised from bond buyers to boost returns for its stock holders, namely by repurchasing shares. Indeed, as bondholders suffered losses since January, the company’s stock soared more than 8 percent. As yields go lower on all corporate debt, investors are taking a bigger gamble that benchmark rates will stay low for a longer period of time. “Rates are so low that ultimately, what are investors going to get out of it at the end of the day?” Lurie said. On $6 billion of new Apple bonds, nothing but losses so far.\\n\\n\\nGoogle\\'s CFO retires to spend time with family: Patrick Pichette, Google’s chief financial officer, is retiring to spend more time with his family. Seriously. On Tuesday Mr. Pichette announced the news of his retirement on Google’s social network, Google Plus. Then, in what Google’s chief executive, Larry Page, described as “a most unconventional leaving notice” he tried to convince the cynics that he is, indeed, retiring to spend more time with his family. “We give a lot to our jobs,” he wrote, adding: “And while I am not looking for sympathy, I want to share my thought process because so many people struggle to strike the right balance between work and personal life.” For the last seven years, Mr. Pichette, 52, has been the primary liaison between Google and Wall Street, serving as the search giant’s chief defender against analysts who have been needling the company to do things like spend less money on “moonshots” or give shareholders some of their cash back. In the company’s latest conference call, for instance, he repeatedly defended Google’s speculative investment spending – which range from biotech to self-driving cars – as “disciplined.” He said the company did not have any immediate plans to issue a dividend to shareholders, but also didn’t rule it out. And, for analysts who needed the reassurance, he noted that Google’s stock price “does matter” to its managers. Mr. Pichette’s goodbye letter was touching, adventurous and completely outside the experience of 99 percent of the world’s population. On Google Plus, he wrote that the process that led to his decision to retire began in September. He was watching the sunrise from the top of Mount Kilimanjaro when his wife suggested they continue traveling the world. He replied that it wasn’t time yet – he had too much to accomplish at Google and elsewhere, he wrote. She asked when it would be time. Apparently that time is in a few months, during which Google will search for Mr. Pichette’s replacement, according to a spokesman. “The questions just hung there in the cold morning African air,” Mr. Pichette wrote of his thoughts about retirement from atop Kilimanjaro. There ensued a long mediation on life, children and work (Mr. Pichette said he belonged to the “Fraternity of Worldwide Insecure Overachievers”). “Allow me to spare you the rest of the truths,” he wrote. “But the short answer is simply that I could not find a good argument to tell Tamar we should wait any longer for us to grab our backpacks and hit the road — celebrate our last 25 years together by turning the page and enjoy a perfectly fine midlife crisis full of bliss and beauty, and leave the door open to serendipity for our next leadership opportunities, once our long list of travels and adventures is exhausted.”\\n\\n\\nFacebook Finally Lets Its Firehose Be Tapped For Marketing Insights: Twitter’s firehose of tweets has long been offered as a goldmine for businesses trying to understand how to improve or market their products, and now Facebook will allow privacy-safe peeks at its treasure trove, too. Today Facebook launched a new insights product called “Topic Data” in the U.S. and U.K. with the help of brand analytics leader DataSift. Facebook explains that “Topic data shows marketers what audiences are saying on Facebook about events, brands, subjects and activities.” For example, “A business selling a hair de-frizzing product can see demographics on the people talking about humidity’s effects on their hair.” On days when everyone’s posting status updates about how frizzy their hair is, a brand could step up its ad spend knowing it’s the perfect time to reach potential customers. Sentiment, location, volume of mentions and words often mentioned alongside a brand can be pulled, too. Because much of Facebook’s data is private, unlike Twitter, offering Topic Data in a privacy-safe way is a top concern and might explain why Facebook waited so long to offer this functionality that brands have been begging for. To ensure personal info isn’t divulged, Topic Data is aggregated and anonymized, so brands can’t know or piece together exactly who said what. Queries that might pull up personally identifiable data like home addresses will be banned. At least 100 different users have to match a query for it to be allowed. Still, the idea that their private status messages to friends will fuel better ad targeting may irk some Facebook users. There’s no opt-out, and the only way to keep data totally private is to either set posts to be visible to “only me” or not post at all. To be clear, this isn’t a brand monitoring tool. It’s not designed to let companies see every mention of their business and try to respond. That wouldn’t work since data is anonymized any way. Brands issue the forward-looking queries through a third-party analytics provider that submits them to DataSift, which can run them against Facebook’s data. DataSift hands the analytics tool back anonymized statistical data about posts that match the query since it was issued that can be formed into charts and insights, or bundled with social analytics from other networks. More examples Facebook gives for how to use Topic Data include: “A fashion retailer could see the clothing items its target audience is talking about to decide which products to stock.” “A brand can see how people are talking about their brand or industry to measure brand sentiment.” When Twitter opened its firehose to this kind of analysis a few years back, it spawned an entire ecosystem of data interpreters, including Adobe Social, Brandwatch, Crimson Hexagon, Socialmetrix and DataSift itself, which was one of only a few companies allowed to sell the full Twitter firehose at one point. Facebook will authorize a limited, undisclosed list of tools it’s already working with to access its firehose through DataSift.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba investee Weibo 2014 revenue: $334M, +77%; loss widens to $63.4M; 176 MAU in Dec, +36% Y/Y Weibo, China’s Twitter-like social network, continues to grow – albeit slowly. Weibo ended 2014 with 175.7 million monthly active users (MAUs), which is up 36 percent year-on-year, and up 5.2 percent from Q3 to Q4. Although many have talked about WeChat making Weibo irrelevant, it seems that Weibo is standing its ground against the hugely popular messaging app (WeChat is close to 500 million MAUs) despite a number of areas of overlap between the two social networks. Weibo’s newest data, released overnight as part of the company’s Q4 2014 earnings report, also shows that daily active users (DAUs) are moving upwards slowly. Weibo now has 80.6 million DAUs. As always with Weibo, there are concerns about how many of those users are humans or spambots. So is Weibo, which started in 2009 and received US$586 million in investment from Alibaba in 2013, making any money after five years of operations? Nope. Throughout the whole of 2014, Weibo made $334.2 million in revenue (up 77 percent from 2013’s tally), but that translated into a net loss of US$63.4 million, which is greater than its losses in 2013.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple unveils the Apple Watch and\\xa0makes\\xa0a play for the truly affluent with a watch — priced as high as $17,000: Pricing:\\xa0the device would start at $350 and, depending on the band and finish you chose, go into the thousands of dollars.\\xa0Battery Life: While rumors had suggested that Apple was having trouble getting the battery lifespan up to something reasonable, Apple now claims that its watch should be able to handle at least 18 hours of regular use. That’ll vary depending on how you use it, of course — but Apple is content enough with the lifespan to call it an “All-day battery”.Hardware: the Apple Watch comes close to being beautiful, and it is certainly one of the best-looking computers you can buy for your wrist. Yet it’s hard to forget that it is a computer for your wrist. Even in its top-end versions, it lacks the understated elegance of old-fashioned high-end analog watches. Interface: Last fall, Apple made a big show of the rotating crown on the side of the device, the company’s take on what most of us call a watch dial. The company held up the crown as its next great interface, something on the order of the mouse, the iPod’s clickwheel or the touch screen on the iPhone. I was surprised, therefore, to discover how small a role the crown plays in typical use of the watch. It has two primary uses: When you press it, you get to the watch’s main screen of apps — or, if you’re already on that screen, the watch switches to displaying the clock. In other words, the crown works as a home button. Uses: Apple spent a long while going through most of the watch’s major functions, including its use as a fitness tracker, texting app, email reader and payment device for locations that accept Apple Pay. I boiled down the list to this rule of thumb: Just about anything you can do with your phone, you can do with your watch, faster. But because the watch needs the phone for connectivity, it’s hardly liberating you from that device. It’s just giving you less of a reason to look at it. Collections: The Apple Watch is unique among Apple’s product offerings in terms of just how much variety it offers in terms of buyer options. To help clarify and define the available choices, the company has separated Apple Watch models into three distinct collections: The Apple Watch Sport, the Apple Watch, and the Apple Watch Edition. All three offer both 38mm and 42mm rectangular case sizing options, but materials and finishes vary by collection, as do the band options offered by default. \\n\\n\\nAs Alibaba stock continues to slide, firm announces a re-org, brings Taobao, Tmall and Juhuasuan into a newly created division: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd appointed Jeff Zhang to oversee its main services on Monday, bringing Taobao, Tmall and Juhuasuan into a newly created \"China Retail Marketplaces\" division. The appointment marks one of the highest-profile personnel shuffles since China\\'s largest e-commerce company went public in September. Together with the creation of the new division, the move will streamline operations and enhance efficiency. The company, which now handles more ecommerce than Amazon.com and eBay Inc combined, has been struggling to sustain the rip-roaring pace of growth it enjoyed in past years as it gains scale. It\\'s unclear how Zhang\\'s appointment affected Yilei Wang, who was President of the Amazon.com-like Tmall retail website. On Monday, Chinese news website sina.com reported that Wang had been dismissed from his post, though the company declined to comment on his current situation. Shares in the company ended 2.2 percent lower at $82.53 on the New York stock exchange. \\n\\n\\nIndia is becoming the land of the errand app: A growing number of startups cater to people who want to avoid the poor roads and polluted air, and can afford to do so because of the plentiful cheap labor. Almost anyone can use an app to have someone pick up groceries, drop off a letter at the post office or prepare a lunch that runs 75 rupees ($1.20) with delivery. “People today want to do as much as possible with their phones,” said TinyOwl co-founder Mandad, who graduated from Mumbai’s Indian Institute of Technology in 2012. “It is a friction just to go out -- there’s the heavy traffic, pollution and waiting involved for a cab.” The startups are carving out niches by serving certain neighborhoods or parts of cities, realizing the “hyper-local” strategy long envisioned in more developed countries including the U.S. Larger e-commerce companies such as Flipkart and Snapdeal dominate online sales of more traditional goods, including books, apparel and electronic goods. Need your bike serviced, your dry-cleaning picked up or even your own errand boy for a few hours? There are services for all that. There are also at least a dozen startups focused on food and grocery delivery, with angel investors and venture capital firms lining up to invest. With traffic snarls in big Indian cities an everyday occurrence, it’s common to find vehicles crawling along at less than 5 kilometers per hour on some Delhi roads, almost as slow as bullock carts, government data shows. Air quality is poor, with several cities faring worse than even Beijing. All that has translated to fewer visitors in stores. People can get everything from apparel to groceries at the click of a button, said consultant Ashok Deenadayalu, who advises retailers on strategy and store management. “Earlier it used to be a pastime to go to the malls on a weekend,” Deenadayalu, who’s had a 24-year career at some of the nation’s largest chains such as Reliance Retail, Bharti Wal Mart Pvt. and Metro AG. “Now it’s just a torture.”\\n\\n\\nChina\\'s market regulator claims it will tighten eCommerce regulations: China’s market regulator said today that the government will regulate ecommerce more strictly in an upcoming clampdown on counterfeit products and poor customer service. The comments came from Zhang Mao, minister of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), speaking on the sidelines of China’s annual parliamentary session, according to state news agency Xinhua. The move comes weeks after the SAIC produced a controversial report on fake products being sold online by China’s top ecommerce stores. That report slammed Alibaba’s marketplace, Taobao, claiming that about 63 percent of the stuff for sale on the site is counterfeit. However, that was extrapolated from a survey of 51 products that SAIC’s secret shoppers bought from Taobao. SAIC’s entire report was based on just 92 products bought from six leading Chinese estores. “The reason why there are so many market violations is that the cost of breaking rules is too low,” Zhang said Monday in reference to Taobao’s poor performance in the SAIC’s study. He added that new regulations on ecommerce would be focused on companies’ “key responsibilities” to consumers in terms of “credibility and integrity.” Referring to China’s online retailers, Zhang said the SAIC will “listen to them, provide guidance for them, and demand their self-discipline.”\\n\\n\\nWhat Brands Are Already Doing on the Apple Watch: Each use case is remarkably different: Starwood Hotels: The tech-savvy hotel chain is working with software company WatchKit on its upcoming smartwatch app. The Stamford, Conn.-based hospitality marketer already has a smartphone app that unlocks hotel room doors, and its smartwatch app plans to do the same. It\\'s a simple concept, yet it entails big implications in cutting the cost that hotel brands pour into producing physical room cards. Retale: The location-based couponing app turns print circular ads into digital promos from 130 merchants and will be one of the first retail names to launch a dedicated feature for Apple Watch. The wrist app will sync with Retale\\'s existing iPhone and iPad apps, so people can save information—like lists of local stores—on multiple devices. Retale is tight-lipped about what the actual app will look like, but it will take advantage of a store-finder feature to help people locate nearby offers. A mockup of the app shows a map that plots the distance from a user to a nearby Target store, for example. Marsh Supermarkets: Earlier this year, Marsh Supermarkets started loading up its 75 stores with beacons in anticipation for Apple\\'s smartwatch announcement. Up until now, beacons have primarily been utilized to trigger push notifications on smartphones, and Marsh claims to be the first to employ the technology to build out a smartwatch app with beacon vendor InMarket. Shazam: The music-discovery app has its sights on devices beyond smartphones, as CMO Patricia Parra said last week. Like InMarket\\'s Dipaola, Shazam\\'s Parra also plans to eventually make the content that smartwatches stream handless. \"We are going to get to a world where you don\\'t even have to [touch an app],\" she said. \"We are going to be wearing stuff that tells us things like when our blood pressure rises.\" These sites are already overloaded with user-generated photos, and with wrist-enabled cameras, one can only expect for the amount of photos to grow. Panera Bread: In September, the bakery chain rolled out Apple Pay, which includes an option to pay through Apple Watch. Similar to other brands\\' apps, the payment technology plugs into Panera\\'s mobile app and lets people hold the watch over a reader that\\'s at the point of sale. CNN: The news site\\'s upcoming app will pull in breaking news from 12 categories like breaking news, health and entertainment. The app will also livestream CNN TV coverage and lets people tap to read and save stories.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdding to India investments,\\xa0News Corp buys VCCircle:\\xa0News Corp is continuing its focus on India after it announced a deal to buy tech and startup-focused media company VCCircle. Founded in 2005, VCCircle runs news sites VCCircle.com and Techcircle.in, in addition to research platform VCCEdge, VCCircle Training and an events business. The Noida-headquartered company has over 100 staff, and it will become part of the News Corp India organization, which already includes Dow Jones and Wall Street Journal. The undisclosed deal is Media Corp’s third piece of business in India, each of which has closed in the past six months. The U.S. media giant put $30 million into property company PropTiger back in November, and it bought financial planning service Bigdecisions.com in December. “This significant investment is a sign of our faith in India’s future and our enthusiasm for working with and building up emerging talents in the country. India is an increasingly meaningful part of our portfolio, which is itself increasingly digital and global,” News Corp Chief Executive Robert Thomson said in a canned statement. P.V. Sahad, Founder and CEO of VCCircle, said that the company’s acquisition would “accelerate our already aggressive growth plans,” although he did not provide more specific details of those goals. India’s booming tech scene is attracting investors in large numbers — including SoftBank, Google Capital and a new Tiger Global fund — and higher funding rounds, all of which increases the importance of quality on-the-ground reporting, analysis and events. Added to that, this is an interesting deal because we don’t often see ‘pure-play’ media companies being acquired in India.\\n\\n\\nJet, an American marketplace is gaining traction by focusing on the merchant experience rather than the customer experience: The Jet business model is pretty simple.  Jet plans on making their revenue from a $50/yr subscription paid for by members.  Like a warehouse club model (Costco, BJ’s, Sams) that will be the primary driver.  Also like a wholesale club model, Jet plans on passing a lot of savings to the member. The merchant model is similar to what you would find at an eBay or Amazon marketplace – you pay a commission for sales based on category.  BUT there are two important differences: A merchant can choose a variable commission based on your own rules (see example below) for shipping, email opt-in, returns and more. Jet takes the commission and instead of pocketing it as profit as other marketplaces do, it returns it to the consumer in the form of Jet savings and behavior based incentives (more on this later).\\n\\n\\nAmazon opens store on Alibaba\\'s online marketplace Tmall: Amazon.com Inc has opened an online store on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\\'s fast-growing online marketplace, Tmall.com as it seeks to expand in China, an Alibaba spokesman said. Alibaba\\'s Tmall offers virtual storefronts and payment portals to merchants. Several western retailers, including Zara owner Inditex, Britain\\'s Burberry and ASOS, have joined TMall this year as they look to boost their presence in China. Imported food, shoes, toys and kitchenware are listed on Amazon\\'s store, one of the many on Tmall that sell brand-name goods to Chinese shoppers, Bloomberg, which first reported the news, said on Thursday. Amazon also operates its own e-commerce site in China. U.S. retailer Costco Wholesale Corp last year opened an online store in China using Tmall, entering the country\\'s booming e-commerce market to combat slowing sales at home. Amazon’s China website has long struggled in the country, trailing behind Alibaba’s two marketplaces (Taobao and Tmall) as well as other homegrown rivals like JD and Suning. Amazon was China’s eighth biggest estore at the end of 2014, with just 1.3 percent market share of transaction value, according to data from iResearch. Tmall dominates the market with 57.6 percent market share. It’s an awkward but inevitable situation for Amazon. It’s as if Amazon opened up a huge shop on the wrong side of town and then had to suffer the indignity of opening up a branch in Alibaba’s crowded shopping mall where there’s much greater foot traffic. This move means Amazon is effectively an Alibaba customer and has to pay a commission for each sale that occurs in the Tmall outlet. A number of major brands and retailers use Tmall for their flagship stores, even though many have their own standalone ecommerce sites in China. Other online retailing companies have opened up stores on Tmall before, such as Walmart’s Yihaodian.\\n\\n\\nAs programming becomes ubiquitous, Yale\\'s weak Computer Science program is driving top students to Stanford, Harvard instead: One of the world\\'s top universities in most respects, Yale has fallen way behind in computer science. Yale, one of the world\\'s top universities in most respects, has fallen behind in computer science. It doesn\\'t crack the highest tier of schools measured by the number of graduates in software companies or by salaries for majors in the discipline; it\\'s struggling to educate throngs of students with a faculty about the same size as three decades ago; top students in the field are opting to enroll elsewhere; the head of its computer science department is publicly complaining; and undergraduates are circulating a petition in protest. “The best universities in the world are now judged by the quality of their computer science departments,” reads the petition, distributed this week and signed by more than 450 students. “We are distraught by the condition of Yale\\'s.” Yale has long been known for its strength in the humanities. Literature scholars deconstructed texts in cloistered seminar rooms at the center of its Gothic campus, while the more quantitative-minded had to trek up “Science Hill” for their classes. Famed English literature professor Harold Bloom once told the Paris Review that he favored the ballpoint pen over the typewriter and “as far as I\\'m concerned, computers have as much to do with literature as space travel, perhaps much less.” Yale\\'s computer science department has focused more on theory than practical applications, unlike Stanford University, known as the birthplace of Google, or Harvard, associated with Facebook and Microsoft. Though many of Yale\\'s science Ph.D. programs such as biology, math, physics, and chemistry are top-ranked, Yale is struggling to adapt to a U.S. economy and educational system reordered by the ascendance of technology. With fewer students majoring in the humanities and a generation of graduates worried about getting good jobs, universities are scrambling to shift resources from traditional subjects into fields once scoffed at as vocational. “These are skills needed by anyone in the modern age,” says Jeannette Wing, who oversees research labs worldwide for Microsoft. All students should learn programming, even those studying such fields as archeology and English, she says.\\n\\n\\nApple\\'s Secret Lab Lets Facebook Fine-Tune Apps Before the Watch\\'s Debut: In a lab shut off from communication with the outside world and where visitors can\\'t bring in a pad of paper, let alone a phone, Apple Inc. has given some companies special early access to Apple Watch. Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, Facebook Inc., United Continental Holdings Inc. and others have spent weeks at Apple\\'s headquarters in Cupertino, California, working hands-on with the smartwatch to test and fine-tune applications that will debut alongside the device next month, according to people familiar with the process, who asked not to be identified because of non-disclosure agreements. Apple, which will share more details about the gadget at a March 9 event, uses extreme measures to keep the work secret. Internet access is blocked inside the rooms, and no outside materials can be brought in to the labs with the test watches, a person who attended said. The companies, sometimes sharing a room, must bring in source code for their apps on a computer hard drive that can\\'t leave Apple\\'s headquarters. To prevent information from leaking out, Apple is storing the code and sending it to the companies closer to the watch\\'s introduction date, the person said. \"There\\'s a lot of confidentiality,\" said Stephen Gates, a vice president and creative director for Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., which is building a watch application to unlock hotel-room doors. Apple featured Starwood\\'s application in September, when it first announced the watch. Gates said he\\'s made several trips to Cupertino to develop the software, but declined to comment on what those visits included. As Apple\\'s first new device since the iPad in 2010, the stakes are high for Apple Watch, and the sophistication of the apps available is critical in wooing buyers. Just as the App Store has been a key reason for the iPhone\\'s success, tools for Apple Watch will help determine how customers use the gadget and whether it will be a sales hit. The watch must be paired with an iPhone to fully work, and anything less than seamless integration may alienate potential customers. Apple has made the yet-to-be-released watch available to some companies so they can test out their apps, check for glitches and adjust the tools to the watch\\'s design. Hundreds of applications may immediately be available once the Watch reaches stores, according to Jim Suva, an analyst at Citigroup Inc. A big challenge for Apple and its developers is building applications that are useful without being annoying. Apple has recommended that developers be judicious about interrupting people with constant alerts that will buzz their wrist or drain the battery. If desktop computers can be used for hours at a time, and smartphones for minutes, the watch is being measured in seconds. Apple is suggesting developers design their applications to be used for no longer than 10 seconds at a time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFlipkart of India, to Bolster Its Tech Credentials, Hires Former Google Executive:\\xa0Despite having raised billions of dollars and attaining a valuation of over $10 billion, the Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart isn’t necessarily the biggest name in Silicon Valley. Yet with its latest hire, the company is hoping to signal that it too can be a player. Flipkart plans to announce on Wednesday that it has hired Punit Soni, a former Google executive who most recently was a senior vice president for product management at Motorola Mobility when it was owned by Google. By tapping Mr. Soni to oversee Flipkart’s current and future products — and, in particular, their design and who is hired to design them — the e-commerce company means to show that it wants to attract top-level employees. “This really raises the bar for hiring talent,” Mukesh Bansal, the head of Flipkart’s commerce platform, said in a telephone interview. As the tech industry takes note of the rise of giants like the Alibaba Group of China, Flipkart’s executives are eager to show that India and its booming Internet sector are worth watching as well. Flipkart has become something like an Alibaba for the subcontinent, with Mr. Bansal saying that his company controls almost half of the country’s online shopping market. Yet when Mr. Soni announced his departure from Google last fall, around the time that it sold Motorola Mobility to Lenovo of China, he said in an interview that Flipkart wasn’t even on his radar screen. At Motorola Mobility, he had served as a public face for the phone maker, especially in terms of discussing its products and plans with the public on the Google+ social network. But he was on the Indian company’s radar, ever since the two collaborated on bringing Motorola phones onto Flipkart’s sales platforms. Initially, he didn’t take the approach by Flipkart seriously. But when he traveled to India to observe the company’s operations firsthand, he said, his eyes opened. He went to one of the market operator’s warehouses and trucking systems, watching fellow Indians working jobs that they never could have had before. “I could see how the spread of an organized e-commerce system was actually changing people’s lives,” Mr. Soni said. “It was probably that evening that I realized this was not just a run-of-the-mill job.” After spending time at Flipkart, he also was surprised to see what he called a strong engineering culture at the company. But he also plans to try and infuse his new employer with more of the values — and employees — of Silicon Valley.\\n\\n\\nAmazon launches mobile app for India sellers: Amazon has launched a mobile app for sellers who use its platform in India to sell their products. The company has over 20,000 sellers on its India marketplace Amazon.in across categories such as mobiles, books, clothing, kitchen appliances etc. The new merchant app will allow direct buyer-seller communication besides giving a free hand to the sellers to update inventory, source and list new items on Amazon.in and respond faster to customer queries. Sellers will also be able to view their sales summary for the day. They can also track order, fulfilment notification and shipment confirmation through the app. The app was previously available to sellers in other international markets of the company. According to the firm, the sellers using the app have reported a 30 per cent faster response time to customer enquiries. Amazon.in has customised the app for the Indian market by allowing listings of only new products and integrating the EasyShip in-browser experience. Vendors can also source new items to sell through the app by checking current prices, sale rank and customer reviews of items on Amazon.in using text search or scanning barcodes. Sellers will be able to estimate the profitability of the items before they are listed for sale as well. They can also use the app to contact seller support via email or phone call-back support and can provide feedback about the app directly to Amazon from within the app. It is a free app and needs only a sellers’ registration on Amazon.in to operate. Currently it is available for Android and iOS devices and can be downloaded from Google Play Store, Apple iTunes Store and the Amazon Appstore.\\n\\n\\nFacebook\\'s Instagram rolls out new \\'carousel\\' ads: Instagram will let brand marketers showcase more images on its photo-sharing smartphone app, the Facebook-owned service’s latest move to expand its money-making advertising features. The new “carousel ads” feature will let brands post multiple images, which users can scroll through by swiping their finger across the phone’s screen. The idea, according to a post on Instagram’s official blog on Wednesday, is to match the multi-page ad campaigns found in print magazines. An automobile company, for example, could highlight different features of a new car and include a link to a website with more product information. The carousel ads feature will initially be available in the United States to a limited set of advertising partners, Instagram said. Instagram, which Facebook Inc acquired in 2012 for $1 billion, has 300 million monthly users. The new ad service marks the latest step in Instagram’s effort to position its mobile service as an online marketing channel. Instagram introduced photo ads in late 2013 and rolled out video ads last year.\\n\\n\\nXiaomi forecasts $16B in revenue, >50% growth this year: Xiaomi Corp. expects revenue this year to rise more than 50 percent as China’s biggest smartphone vendor diversifies its product lineup and expands to more overseas markets. The projection for more than 100 billion yuan ($16 billion) in sales compares with last year’s total of 74.3 billion yuan, founder and Chief Executive Officer Lei Jun told reporters at the National People’s Congress in Beijing Thursday. The company’s revenue more than doubled last year. Xiaomi’s valuation has surged to $45 billion just four years after releasing its first smartphone, with the company tapping the surging domestic demand for inexpensive devices packed with high-end features. The closely held company has taken stakes in more than 20 startups in the past two years, adding products including air purifiers and light bulbs that can be controlled by smartphones. “There’s no doubt sales will surpass 100 billion yuan this year, and growth will be more than 50 percent,” Lei said. Mobile Internet and other Internet businesses “maintain strong growth” amid weakening conditions in the Chinese economy.\\n\\n\\nHow Alibaba\\'s U.S. IPO Got the Company Ordered Out of Taiwan: Documents give government evidence it needs to make the Chinese connection. Taiwan wants to kick Alibaba.com out because it\\'s Chinese. Of course, everybody has known since its inception that Alibaba, the world\\'s largest e-commerce operator, is Chinese. What\\'s operating in Taiwan, however, is Alibaba.com Singapore E-Commerce Private Ltd. When that company was registered on April 9, 2008, Jack Ma\\'s outfit was doing what it does in many countries, and indeed what many corporations do in many countries: operating via an offshore holding company. But in Taiwan, the difference between being Singaporean and Chinese is as stark as night and day. If your company is from Singapore, the U.S., Japan or just about anywhere, then Taiwan is open for business. If you\\'re from mainland China: not so much. Then Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. filed for its record-breaking U.S. IPO. While Yahoo! Inc., Singapore\\'s Temasek Holdings, Ma and everyone else got rich, Taiwan got a nice little present too. The hundreds of pages of pre-IPO documents, such as Alibaba\\'s prospectus, contained the information Taiwan\\'s investment commission needed to prove what it already thought it knew, Chang said. So now that it has evidence of the alleged Chineseness, it\\'s ordered Alibaba out by the end of August. They could either sell the business or close it, Chang said. Alibaba though, doesn\\'t appear ready to walk away. Taiwan is an important market, Ma told reporters in Taipei later the same day. It complied with the law when it entered, and complies with local laws wherever it goes, he said. \"We will actively communicate with related parties to clarify the issues and, if necessary, will take proper actions to protect the legitimate interests of Alibaba.com,\" the company said in a statement.\\n\\n\\nApple Inc will delay the start of production on a larger, 12.9-inch iPad until around September because of problems involving the display panel supply, said a report by Bloomberg News citing people familiar with the company\\'s plans as saying.

Here’s a quick breakdown of the highlights: JD, which mainly sells its own inventory directly to customers, sold RMB 85.8 billion (US$13.8 billion) worth of stuff, more than double what it sold during the same quarter last year. Alibaba’s Tmall and Taobao third-party marketplaces hit US$47 billion and US$79.3 billion, respectively, during the same quarter. Net revenue increased 73 percent year-on-year to RMB 34.7 billion (US$5.6 billion). Annual active accounts more than doubled throughout last year, from 47.4 million to 96.6 million. JD fulfilled 217.8 million orders, up from 111.7 million from a year ago. JD’s best-selling product category up to this point has always been electronics and appliances, but in 2014 \"general merchandise\" rose 173 percent year-on-year to take the number one spot. While most of JD’s revenues came from direct sales, the 60,000 additional merchants on its site make up a large portion of goods sold as well. Direct sales gross merchandise value totaled RMB 48.4 billion (US$7.7 billion), while third-party merchants reached RMB 37.4 billion (US$6.0 billion). Tencent bought a 15 percent stake in JD in March last year, which resulted in new shopping channels on the country’s two biggest messaging apps. JD’s sales volume from WeChat and QQ more than doubled since the third quarter. The report didn’t specify actual sales data for those platforms.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba stock at post-IPO low on China growth, Taiwan regulatory issues, JD\\'s better than expected results:  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. shares fell to their lowest level since debuting after rival online retailer JD.com Inc. reported better-than-projected earnings, fueling concern that Alibaba’s sales growth may be decelerating. The shares of Hangzhou, China-based Alibaba declined 2.9 percent to $81.58 at the close in New York. Earlier, the stock fell to $80.03, the lowest price since the day after the company’s September initial public offering. JD.com shares fell 2.2 percent to $27.53. Both stocks are listed in the U.S. Alibaba, which missed revenue estimates in the latest quarter, is contending with a decelerating Chinese economy and scathing criticism from the government for alleged lax oversight of its websites. The company is also facing competition from JD.com and is working to keep operating in Taiwan after being told to leave after alleged investment violations. “There may be some money shifting from Alibaba to JD,” said Ella Ji, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York. JD.com reported revenue of 34.7 billion yuan ($5.6 billion) in the fourth quarter, topping analysts’ average projection for 32.9 billion yuan, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Beijing-based company also issued a forecast for first-quarter sales that exceeded predictions. The challenges in Taiwan and a Wall Street Journal report about Alibaba merchants paying people to pretend to be customers, called “brushing,” to pad sales figures have created some short-term negative publicity, Ji said.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba to launch data center in the US, aimed at US operations of Chinese companies: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd is launching a cloud computing hub in Silicon Valley on Wednesday, the e-commerce giant\\'s first outside of China, underscoring its global ambitions in the face of stiff and entrenched competition. The new California data center marks the Chinese company\\'s latest measured expansion onto American soil, and into a hotly contested U.S. market now dominated by Amazon.com Inc , Microsoft Corp and Google Inc. Alibaba\\'s Aliyun cloud division intends the new data center to cater initially to Chinese companies with operations in the United States, including retail, Internet and gaming firms. It will later target U.S. businesses seeking a presence in both countries, Ethan Yu, a vice president at Alibaba who runs the international cloud business, told Reuters. Aliyun, which has been likened to a budding version of Amazon Web Services, began as part of the company\\'s in-house technical infrastructure but has since expanded to lease processing and storage space for small and medium Internet businesses in China. While Alibaba dominates e-commerce in China, Aliyun, also known as Alibaba Cloud Computing, holds about a 23 percent market share in its home market. It faces both Chinese and foreign competitors, from carriers like China Telecom to Microsoft and Amazon. Its existing data centers span the Chinese cities of Hangzhou, Qingdao, Beijing, Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Alibaba has big plans for Aliyun, which now accounts for about 1 percent of its revenue but supports its core e-commerce operation and will also play a pivotal role in the long run. Alibaba sees cloud computing as key to its plans to aggregate and analyze the vast quantities of data it collects, including on consumer behavior. Cloud computing and infrastructure was the company\\'s fastest-growing business segment in the December quarter, increasing sales 85 percent to $58 million.\\n\\n\\nPizza Hut, Visa and Accenture prototype beacon-based pizza-ordering at Mobile World Congress: The firms are teaming up to test a system that lets you order and pay for your pie from your car, the companies announced Monday.Visa is demonstrating a proof-of-concept car at the ongoing Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Here\\'s how it works: Visa\\'s checkout payment system is integrated into the dashboard of the car. The driver uses voice control technology to place an order by accessing Pizza Hut\\'s menu. Visa and Pizza Hut then validate your payment card information, and the pizza gets cooking. As you drive up to the nearest outlet, the restaurant is alerted to your arrival using Bluetooth-enabled \"beacon technology.\" That\\'s when your car acts as your payment card, sends your details to Pizza Hut\\'s point-of-sale system, and the transaction is completed. Finally, your pizza is delivered to your car. When it comes to security, the technology isn\\'t any different from swiping your card at a terminal, according to McCarthy. Drivers would still have to opt in to the car manufacturer and network provider\\'s privacy terms and conditions, he said. This isn\\'t the first experiment at combining retail with connected cars. Automakers debuted a slew of new concepts at this year\\'s International Consumer Electronics Show, as my colleague Hayley Tsukayama reported. For example, General Motors debuted a service that supplies drivers with coupons from sites like RetailMeNot for shopping discounts or lets them book last-minute hotel reservations using data from Priceline.com. GM conducted a pilot program for subscribers through OnStar, the carmaker\\'s onboard service provider.\\n\\n\\nFacebook working on competitor to Twitter\\'s MoPub: Facebook Inc. is working on a competitor to Twitter Inc.’s mobile-advertising distributor MoPub, according to people with knowledge of the matter, a bid to win more business in a growing market. The product is among several advertising moves that may be announced at the company’s F8 developer conference this month, though Facebook hasn’t yet decided whether it will release it then, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Facebook has been building out the infrastructure that would support such a product. At its developer conference last year, Facebook released its Audience Network, giving advertisers a way to run their Facebook ads on third-party mobile applications. Its Atlas product also tracks people anonymously to give advertisers feedback on their ads, telling marketers if a person has seen the spots and on what device. MoPub, which Twitter acquired in 2013, gives advertisers a single place to serve their promotions to mobile apps and get feedback on their performance. Advertisers can bid in real time on prime locations for their ads on more than 1 billion devices.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

NTT Communications, an unlisted division of Japanese telecom firm Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) (9432.T) didn\\'t disclose the deal\\'s financial terms. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this month the NTT unit was in talks to buy e-shelter for about 100 billion yen ($832 million). In a joint statement, NTT Communications and e-shelter said the Japanese firm will acquire 86.7 percent of the German company, founded in 2000. Operating data centers in four major cities in Germany including Berlin, as well as in Zurich and Vienna, e-shelter is Germany\\'s biggest provider of data center services, they said. The European deal stretches the NTT brand further across the globe. In 2010, parent NTT bought South Africa\\'s Dimension Data for 382 billion yen, while in 2013 NTT Communications signed deals with a combined value of 85.5 billion yen to take over two U.S. cloud computing firms, Virtela Technology Services and RagingWire Data Centers. Rackspace\\xa0Rackspace Hosting Inc. is open to forging partnerships with large cloud-computing operators such as Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. as the company seeks to bolster slowing revenue growth. Rackspace, which has faced price cuts by Amazon, Microsoft and other competitors, decided in September to reject approaches by multiple groups interested in a partnership or acquisition. Since then, Rhodes hinted that the company has had a team looking at supporting customers who are renting computing services from other providers. Rhodes confirmed on Monday that Rackspace intends to provide third-party support for users of rival cloud-computing services via a combination of people and custom-management software. “There are future versions of our model that will be more capital light and more service oriented,” Rhodes said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDating app Tinder launches slew of product features, dynamic pricing: Tinder’s “Rewind” functionality just went live, finally giving users the ability to go back in time and swipe right instead of left. The “Rewind” feature is included in the premium tier of the service, Tinder Plus, which was unveiled today and costs anywhere between $9.99 and $19.99 in the United States, depending on the age of the user. That’s right. Tinder Plus costs $19.99 for users older than 30, while it costs just $9.99 for folks who are younger than 30. However, in the TechCrunch office we’ve seen Tinder Plus offered at the price of $14.99/month for a 30+ female user. We’ve reached out to Tinder to get a clearer picture of the Tinder Plus pricing structure and will update as soon as we know more. For now, however, we do know that pricing not only ranges based on age but by location. Users in emerging countries (Tinder is currently available in 140 countries across the globe) will pay as little as $2.99/month, while users older than 28 in developed markets like the UK will be paying approximately $23/month (and nearly 4x as much as their over 28-year-old counterparts). Tinder has been testing pricing in various markets for the past few months, but even without the complete information, it’s easy to get an idea of the general landscape here. Older users, who theoretically have less supply and offer less demand, should pay a greater amount for extra dating tools. Plus, they likely make more money than younger users. It’s Uber’s Surge pricing model applied to romantic endeavors. Tinder Plus also includes Passport, which allows users to search for matches anywhere in the world through the drop of a pin, as opposed to being locked into your current location. Tinder Plus also allows users to buy themselves out of advertisements, though Tinder has yet to launch any ad products just yet. Sources say that the ad product will launch later this month, but it’s unclear what exactly those ads will look like. As for the features launching today, they make a lot of sense given the current user behavior on Tinder. Rewind, in particular, appeals to just about anyone who has swiped left when they meant to swipe right. The company has seen over 6 billion matches in total, though it’s hard to say how many of those matches become anything. That’s not necessarily a bad thing for Tinder. The point is that it has become an addiction, with people mindlessly flipping through potential suitors and swiping based on a gut reaction.\\n\\n\\nIndia’s Mobile Carriers Head Into $14 Billion Fight for Survival: What happens when a wireless operator with millions of customers loses the airwaves it needs to provide service? We may soon find out thanks to an unusual government auction taking place in India. The government will open the bidding Wednesday for airwaves already in use by the biggest carriers, including Bharti Airtel Ltd. and Vodafone Group Plc. They’ll have to compete to keep their licenses in the auction against Mukesh Ambani, who is India’s richest man and has signaled his determination by making the largest deposit of the competition. India’s approach, which is unlike what happens in the U.S., could mean seismic change for the world’s second-largest smartphone market. The airwaves up for auction serve more than 300 million customers and account for almost half of the $19 billion in combined revenue for the four largest operators. “For some of the telcos, renewal of spectrum is a key for survival,” said Nitin Soni, a director at Fitch Ratings in Singapore. Bharti, India’s biggest carrier, and second-ranked Vodafone could each spend as much as $4.5 billion for the spectrum, Soni said. Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. submitted a 45 billion-rupee ($726 million) bank guarantee, the most of any carrier, to participate in the auction, according to data from Mjunction Services Ltd., which is running the sale. Bharti Airtel was second with 43 billion rupees, and Vodafone gave a guarantee of 37 billion rupees. Any company losing previously held airwaves will probably have to shut down business in that region and abandon any investments or infrastructure it’s made. Companies also will lose revenue if they can’t switch to other bands, a move that would probably require new towers or technology. If companies shut down their business in a particular circle, their subscribers will have to look for new cellular operators, said Rishi Tejpal, an analyst at Gartner Inc. in New Delhi. “For some operators, it’s a do-or-die situation,” Tejpal said. “And with Reliance Jio in the picture, nobody knows their strategy.”\\n\\n\\nIt’s official #1: Google says it wants to offer cellular service: A top Google exec has confirmed what many have been speculating for months: That the search giant wants to start offering wireless service. Google isn\\'t necessarily looking to become the next Verizon and AT&T, said Sundar Pichai, Google\\'s head of Android, at the annual Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. But, according to various news reports, Pichai said we\\'ll begin to see more details trickle out in the next few months as Google announces partnerships with wireless carriers and other businesses. Analysts say Google is likely to partner with firms such as T-Mobile and Sprint rather than build its own network from scratch. Asked whether Google\\'s aim was to drive wireless prices down for consumers, Pichai responded that the experiment\\'s goal is to showcase new mobile innovations, according to the Verge. An example: Technology that can automatically reconnect dropped calls. But by adding wireless service to its very long chain of mobile offerings, Google would be showcasing something nobody else has tried: A totally unified cellular experience that\\'s entirely within the Google ecosystem. Google already sells a combination of hardware and software with its line of Nexus phones. Now, Google\\'s wireless service — combined with a Google handset, the Android operating system, the Google app store and Google\\'s own mapping, search and e-mail apps — stands to create a formidable vertical silo that goes far beyond the Nexus experiment.\\n\\n\\nIts official #2: Olacabs acquires TaxiForSure for $200M in cash and stock: Online cab booking service Olacabs.com run by Mumbai-based ANI Technologies Pvt Ltd, has acquired Bangalore-based Serendipity Infolabs Pvt Ltd, which runs rival service TaxiForSure for $200 million (Rs 1,240 crore) in a cash and stock deal, as per a company statement. The breakup of the cash component of the deal could not be immediately ascertained but with the stock swap, TaxiForSure investors—Accel Partners, Helion Venture Partners, Bessemer Venture Partners and Blume Ventures would get small minority equity stakes in Ola. Ola’s backers include SoftBank, Tiger Global, Matrix Partners, Sequoia Capital and Steadview Capital. Ola is already the top player in its business and TaxiForSure is believed to be among the other large firms in its space. Both are locked in a pitched battle against global giant Uber and other local players such as hybrid venture Meru. The company said TaxiForSure will continue to operate as a separate entity, at least for now, with Arvind Singhal (currently COO) being appointed CEO. Aprameya Radhakrishna and Raghunandan G, co-founders of TaxiForSure, will contribute in an advisory role for a certain period. This is the second largest deal in the consumer internet/e-commerce business behind Flipkart’s acquisition of Myntra last year. That deal was reportedly worth over $300 million. TaxiForSure is currently present in 47 cities with over 15,000 vehicles registered on its platform. Ola said the deal compliments the two companies, as TaxiForSure follows a different model of supply and distribution by working with cab operators compared to Ola’s model of working with drivers who own their own cabs.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba and top Chinese university launch new education portal for MOOCs: One of China’s most highly regarded universities has partnered with the country’s biggest ecommerce company to create a new website for massive open online courses, or MOOCs. The generically named Chinese MOOCs was just launched by Peking University and Alibaba as schools around the country begin their new semesters following the Chinese New Year holiday (h/t to TechNode). Chinese MOOCs lists 26 courses, covering subjects in science, law, literature, music, and IT. The website lists six other universities that are apparently on board, including the University of Hong Kong, National Taiwan University, and Beijing Normal, but all the courses currently offered are from Peking University (note: Peking University is also known as Beijing University, or Beida, for short). Using a model similar to Coursera, Chinese MOOCs combines video lectures, quizzes, and other coursework to educate students, who can take courses for free and opt to pay for certificates upon completion. There’s no limit to the number of students per course.\\n\\n\\n\\nU.S. millennials post ‘abysmal’ scores in tech skills test, lag behind foreign peers: The test is called the PIAAC test. It was developed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, better known as the OECD. The test was meant to assess adult skill levels. It was administered worldwide to people ages 16 to 65. The results came out two years ago and barely caused a ripple. But recently ETS went back and delved into the data to look at how  millennials did as a group. After all, they’re the future – and, in America, they\\'re poised to claim the title of largest generation from the baby boomers. U.S. millennials, defined as people 16 to 34 years old, were supposed to be different. They’re digital natives. They get it. High achievement is part of their makeup. But the ETS study found signs of trouble, with its authors warning that the nation was at a crossroads: “We can decide to accept the current levels of mediocrity and inequality or we can decide to address the skills challenge head on.” The challenge is that, in literacy, U.S. millennials scored higher than only three countries. In math, Americans ranked last. In technical problem-saving, they were second from the bottom. But surely America’s brightest were on top? Nope. U.S. millennials with master’s degrees and doctorates did better than their peers in only three countries, Ireland, Poland and Spain. Those in Finland, Sweden and Japan seemed to be on a different planet Top-scoring U.S. millennials – the 90th percentile on the PIAAC test – were at the bottom internationally, ranking higher only than their peers in Spain. The bottom percentile (10th percentile) also lagged behind their peers. And the gap between America’s best and worst was greater than the gap in 14 other countries. This, the study authors said, signaled America’s high degree of inequality. The study called into question America’s educational credentialing system. While few American test-takers lacked a high school degree, the United States didn’t perform any better than countries with relatively high rates of failing to finish high school. And our college graduates didn’t perform well, either. “Abysmal,” noted ETS researcher Madeline Goodman. “There was just no place where we performed well.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn display at Mobile World Congress: an uneasy relationship between tech and telecom: Despite the numerous networking events and business deals, there is a love-hate relationship involving some of the world’s largest mobile carriers and tech giants like Facebook and Google. Both sides rely on each other to provide customers worldwide with high-speed Internet access and online services like music streaming and social networking. Yet as smartphones increasingly become the principal means by which people manage their everyday lives, the telecom and tech giants are jockeying to position themselves as consumers’ main conduit for using the Internet on mobile devices.  “Mobile has become the heart of the Internet,”   This shift has led to some uneasy relationships between telecom and tech companies. For many carriers, which have invested billions of dollars in recent years to upgrade their networks, growing consumer appetite for services like streaming from Netflix has raised fears that telecom operators will be relegated merely to providing the infrastructure that powers the boom in mobile Internet. Telecom executives worry that this role will force operators to miss out on the growing revenue that flows into smartphone applications, Internet gaming and other services, which all run on top of their networks. The concerns come as many carriers’ revenues — particularly in Europe, whose economy continues to stutter — have leveled off. Some industry insiders also have expressed frustration that American tech giants like Google and Amazon, which have used complicated tax structures to reduce their global tax burdens, do not face the same levels of regulatory scrutiny as carriers. That includes the F.C.C.’s net neutrality decision last week, which will allow the agency to treat broadband Internet access as a public utility for regulatory purposes. At the same time, several tech giants have gained footholds in areas traditionally dominated by the big telecom companies. Google, for example, is introducing fiber-optic networks in several American cities, offering television and Internet services at speeds of up to one gigabit a second, 100 times as fast as the average Internet connection. The search giant is running other pilot projects in emerging markets, including Kampala, Uganda, to build Internet infrastructure not offered by local carriers. And Facebook now competes head-on with traditional telecom players after acquiring WhatsApp, the Internet messaging service, last year for $19 billion. Along with Facebook Messenger, the company’s separate messaging service, Facebook now has hundreds of millions of mobile users who have shifted from traditional text messaging — a once highly lucrative revenue source for carriers — to free Internet messaging on their mobile devices. “Operators only have themselves to blame,” said Steven Hartley, a telecom analyst at the research company Ovum in London. “They didn’t adapt to the mobile shifts in the industry. They can’t complain when others beat them to the punch.”\\n\\n\\nIRCTC ties up with Amazon to monetize traffic by selling products online: Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), a subsidiary of the government controlled Indian Railways, has now tied up with Amazon to sell products online. Last year Techcircle.in had reported that IRCTC was in talks with Amazon and Flipkart for a tie-up. In his previous conversation with Techcircle.in, a senior railway official had told that this move will leverage the site’s huge database of over 21 million registered users and convert them into potential customers for third party e-commerce players and in turn act as an additional source of revenue through a fee or other mechanism for IRCTC. IRCTC handles the catering, tourism and online ticketing operations of the Indian Railways. It is the sole seller of railway tickets even though other OTAs come across as additional sales channel for booking in association with IRCTC. Under the agreement, IRCTC will leverage the huge traffic it generates being a virtual monopoly for train e-ticketing to sell products such as consumer electronic, books, shoes, apparel etc. It has added a “shop on Amazon” tab on its homepage which redirects to a separate landing page on Amazon.in.\\n\\n\\nAirbnb looking to raise $1B at $20B valuation: Airbnb Inc. is raising money from investors in a financing round that would value the room-sharing service at $20 billion or more, people with knowledge of the deal said. Airbnb may bring in about $1 billion in the funding, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The closely held company, backed by venture-capital firms including Sequoia Capital, Greylock Partners and Founders Fund, was given a value of $10 billion last year in a round led by TPG Capital Management. Airbnb has raised more than $700 million before the latest financing. At $20 billion, San Francisco-based Airbnb would join the ranks of the most highly valued private U.S. technology companies, including Uber Technologies Inc., Space Exploration Technologies Inc., Snapchat Inc., Dropbox Inc. and Palantir Technologies Inc. It also would be worth almost seven times more than HomeAway Inc., a publicly traded vacation-rental site.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba\\'s direct-from-farm purchases, Baidu\\'s smart chopsticks seek to reassure Chinese consumers amid food safety concerns: Controlling China’s sprawling food supply chain has proved a frustrating endeavor. Government regulators and state-owned agriculture companies have tried to tackle the problem in a number of ways — increasing factory inspections, conducting mass laboratory tests, enhancing enforcement procedures, even with prosecutions and executions — but food safety scandals still emerge too often. Chinese technology companies believe they can do it better. From the farm to the table, the country’s biggest players are looking to upgrade archaic systems with robust data collection, smartphone apps, online marketplaces and fancy gadgetry. The founder of the computer maker Lenovo started Joyvio, the agricultural company that tracks kiwis and other fruit from planting to delivery. The Internet giant Alibaba directly connects consumers with farmers via an online produce-delivery service. A gaming entrepreneur is running a pig farm on the side. And Baidu, the country’s leading search engine, is developing a “smart” chopstick that tests whether food is contaminated. City dwellers can buy directly from farmers through Jutudi, a pilot program created by Alibaba that has about 10,000 users. An e-commerce twist on the “buy local” movement, Jutudi lets users buy regular deliveries of vegetables and fruits from farms across China. Consumers can even pick their own plots in a sort of virtual farming, although deliveries may come from multiple places. Baidu’s smart chopsticks were supposed to be a joke for April Fools’ Day. The search engine giant published a fake advertisement for a set of chopsticks that would determine whether food had been cooked with gutter oil. The ad struck a chord, and it quickly went viral on Chinese social media sites. With such a strong response, Baidu decided to create a real product. Embedded with sensors, the chopsticks primarily test for gutter oil, but they also indicate pH levels and temperature. The product’s charger allows consumers to identify different fruits and vegetables as well as where they were grown and the calories they contain. The company is debating whether to add a feature that would indicate salinity, allowing users to determine whether mineral water is fake. Baidu is currently manufacturing a small batch of prototypes for testing. The company says it has not yet decided when to release the product or how much it will cost. Even so, it has already generated interest. Alibaba is tapping into consumers’ nostalgia for their rural roots with a heavy dose of marketing. The site features a Socialist Realist illustration of two women in a field of golden grain — harking back to the days of Mao Zedong, when farmers were lionized by propaganda. With images of shiny, red tomatoes, well-groomed pigs and other succulent fruits and vegetables, the program also promotes quality. Higher-end packages include tours of the farms.\\n\\n\\nAs Apple readies for smartwatch launch,..:For Apple, the hard part — making a smartwatch — is nearly over. Soon it will be time for the harder part: selling the long-anticipated Apple Watch to consumers who, so far, are not very excited about the idea of wearing computers on their bodies. The first batch of smartwatches from companies like Samsung Electronics, Motorola and LG did not sell well, nor were they particularly well reviewed. And wearable devices like the Google Glass eyewear that got mainstream attention — if not sales — were greeted with considerable skepticism. But Apple has been in this situation before. Most consumers didn’t care about computer tablets before Apple released the iPad, nor did they generally think about buying smartphones before the release of the iPhone. In both cases, the company overcame initial skepticism. Apple has marketed it as a device that can appeal to a range of customers like fitness buffs and luxury watch collectors. But it has limited its functions, making it more like a watch, more easily relatable than a tech doodad that happens to look like a watch, said Ben Bajarin, a consumer technology analyst for Creative Strategies. “This is a brand-new category. Most people have no frame of reference with a smartwatch,” said Mr. Bajarin. In late February, Apple sent out invitations to the media for an event to remind people about the best features of the watch and share some new details about the product, according to two people with knowledge of the event. Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, is expected to be the host. Apple is expected to say more about price. The starting price for a basic Apple Watch is $350. Apple has not yet said how much people will have to pay for higher-end models, like the Apple Watch Edition, which is made of 18-karat gold, though watch enthusiasts estimate that it will cost upward of $10,000.\\n\\n\\n..Huawei unveils its own high-end smartwatch in an effort to beat Apple to the punch: China’s Huawei Technologies Co. unveiled its first smart watch that is aimed at the higher end of the wearables market, a week before Apple Inc. is expected to host an event to present a rival device. The 42-millimeter (1.6-inch) diameter luxury watch will be the world’s first wearable with sapphire crystal glass, Richard Yu, chief executive officer of Huawei’s consumer business group, said at an event in Barcelona Sunday, ahead of the Monday opening of the Mobile World Congress. Yu also unveiled an upgrade to Huawei’s smart band, introduced at last year’s conference. Huawei, ranked fifth in global smartphone shipments during the third quarter, is focusing on higher-end smartphones that can rival Apple’s or models by Samsung Electronics Co. All have expanded into wearables. Apple on Thursday sent out invitations to an event on March 9 in San Francisco, where it will unveil details for the release of the Apple Watch, a person with knowledge of the matter said. The connected, fitness-tracking wristwatch is the first entirely new gadget line to debut since Tim Cook took the helm at the Cupertino, California-based company. For Huawei, this year’s upgrade in accessories comes after sales of higher-end smartphones helped revenue rise about 20 percent in 2014 and operating profit improve. The maker of phone-network gear that also competes against the likes of Ericsson AB, has also been widening its product portfolio as it works toward a goal of achieving $70 billion in revenue by 2018, from $46 billion last year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle story#1: Finally, Google will test ads on the Google Play Store: More coverage here and here : Google Inc. plans to show search ads targeting customers who use its application and media store for Android devices under a pilot program, as the company looks for new ways to generate revenue from mobile devices. In the next few weeks, Google will let application developers buy advertising spots that consumers can see when they search for software in the Google Play store, Michael Siliski, a product management director, said in a blog post Thursday. So, a query for coupon or travel options in the marketplace may show a sponsored result at the top of the query page, the Mountain View, California-based company said. Google, grappling with competition from Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc., is looking for new ways to boost interest from businesses in advertising on wireless devices, where prices for promotions often are less than they are on desktops. The company’s share of the mobile ad market dropped to 41 percent last year from 46 percent in 2013, according to recent research by EMarketer Inc. “We’ve seen how search ads shown next to organic search results on Google.com can significantly improve content discovery for users and advertisers, both large and small,” Siliski said. “Search ads on Google Play will enable developers to drive more awareness of their apps and provide consumers new ways to discover apps that they otherwise might have missed.” Google, the world’s biggest Internet services company, is looking to expand its mobile ad presence as users favor applications such as those from Priceline Group Inc.’s Kayak on handheld devices, which bypass browser-based ads. The new service aims to bolster its appeal to developers that are looking for new ways to attract new consumers. Smartphones using Android dominate the global market with more than 80 percent of the share in 2014, according to IDC. Separately, the company also announced today it has paid out more than $7 billion to developers of games and apps on Google Play in the past year.\\n\\n\\nQuantity and value of data is an overlooked benefit to delaying an IPO: It’s taking longer for startups to get to IPO, but that’s not necessarily bad news for investors in private companies. Why? Because startups today aren’t just valuable for their future exit potential, but for the proprietary data they produce while still private. Market statistics clearly show companies are staying private longer. The average time to IPO has doubled to nine years today from four in 1999, and the median amount raised prior to IPO has increased steadily from $48 million in 2008 to $101 million in 2013. Of the 100 largest VC rounds in history, 90 have occurred in the last five years. There are several reasons startups are staying private longer, including volatile public markets, healthy secondary markets, and a preference by some for mega-M&As. Whatever the reason startups don’t seek IPOs early, there is a real and often overlooked benefit to investors when startups stay private longer – the value of their data.\\n\\n\\nGoogle story#2: Google moifies Search algorithm to increase weight of mobile-friendliness, expand indexing of app deep links: Google today announced two notable changes that will affect the rankings of search results for users accessing Google search on mobile devices. It will now take into consideration a site’s mobile-friendliness as one of its ranking signals, and information from indexed mobile applications will also begin to influence ranking for signed-in users who have the app installed on their smartphone. “As more people use mobile devices to access the internet, our algorithms have to adapt to these usage patterns,” explains Google in its announcement. The changes follow a number of previous efforts Google has made to improve its search results for mobile users. In 2013, for example, it rolled out ranking changes that would affect sites that were misconfigured for smartphone users, including those frustrating situations where a specific URL would redirect all smartphone users to the website’s mobile homepage instead of their preferred destination. This was common among news sites, in particular, as users would often click a link to read a certain story and would end up landing on the site’s main webpage, the story nowhere to be found. Last summer, meanwhile, Google began flagging sites that wouldn’t display on mobile devices due to the technology they used – like those built with Adobe Flash, which meant they wouldn’t display on iOS devices or Android 4.1 and higher. And in November, Google began adding a “mobile-friendly” label to its search results accessed on mobile devices to indicate they would display well on your smartphone’s small screen, after first testing “warning labels” earlier in the year. It noted at the time it was also testing the use of the mobile-friendly criteria as a ranking signal. In a blog post detailing the changes, the company points website owners to a number of resources that can help them prepare for this shift, including its guide to mobile-friendly sites, its Mobile-Friendly Testing tool, and its Mobile Usability Report. In addition, the company also said it will begin taking advantage of its efforts with deep-linking technology to begin to surface information from mobile apps higher in its search results. Deep links, for those unfamiliar, point to specific pages within mobile applications themselves. That means developers who implement these links in their apps allow Google to index their apps in a similar way as it does websites today.\\n\\n\\nThe future of health care is a dongle attached to your smartphone: app-based diagnostics are taking off The latest development in this new direct-to-consumer health model is a new breakthrough from a team of biomedical engineering researchers at Columbia University in New York City that makes it possible to test for both HIV and syphilis in 15 minutes after hooking a plastic dongle into your smartphone’s headphone jack. You simply insert a pinprick of blood onto a disposable plastic collector, connect the plastic collector to a microfluidic chip used to analyze the sample and insert the chip with the blood sample into the dongle. Once you’ve logged into an app, your smartphone can start to determine the presence of HIV or syphilis in your blood and display the results on your smartphone’s screen 15 minutes later. More than its ease of use, the cost factor of the dongle is what makes it possible to speculate that this type of smartphone diagnostics could one day lead to a new direct-to-consumer model for health care. The equipment needed to perform a laboratory-quality HIV test can cost upwards of $18,450 apiece. Contrast that to the cost of a cheap plastic dongle, which costs an estimated $34 to make. That makes it possible to imagine a future where tests are faster, simpler and cheaper than anything available today. What makes the lab-on-a-smartphone so innovative is that, even though you’re significantly reducing cost, you’re not sacrificing power. The results delivered by the new device suggest that a full laboratory-quality immunoassay can be run on a smartphone accessory. Moreover, in a small field study in Rwanda, the team of researchers found that patient preference for the dongle was 97 percent compared to laboratory-based test\\n\\n\\nWhy the U.S. Has Fallen Behind in Internet Speed and Affordability: Downloading a high-definition movie takes about seven seconds in Seoul, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Zurich, Bucharest and Paris, and people pay as little as $30 a month for that connection. In Los Angeles, New York and Washington, downloading the same movie takes 1.4 minutes for people with the fastest Internet available, and they pay $300 a month for the privilege, according to The Cost of Connectivity, a report published Thursday by the New America Foundation’s Open Technology Institute. The report compares Internet access in big American cities with access in Europe and Asia. Some surprising smaller American cities — Chattanooga, Tenn.; Kansas City (in both Kansas and Missouri); Lafayette, La.; and Bristol, Va. — tied for speed with the biggest cities abroad. In each, the high-speed Internet provider is not one of the big cable or phone companies that provide Internet to most of the United States, but a city-run network or start-up service. The reason the United States lags many countries in both speed and affordability, according to people who study the issue, has nothing to do with technology. Instead, it is an economic policy problem — the lack of competition in the broadband industry. “It’s just very simple economics,” said Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School who studies antitrust and communications and was an adviser to the Federal Trade Commission. “The average market has one or two serious Internet providers, and they set their prices at monopoly or duopoly pricing.”\\n\\n\\nIndia Startup Action: Five startups showcased at Techcircle E-commerce Forum 2015: Pumpkart.com: It is an online store for agricultural and domestic pumps. It offers a variety of pumps that include basement toilet pumps, booster pumps, car cleaning pumps, drainage pumps, hydropneumatic pumps, borewell pumps, rainwater pumps, waste water pumps, monoblock pumps, high pressure pumps, solar pumps etc. Crunch Commerce: It extends a layer of m-commerce tools to traditional e-commerce backend. Its flagship product is Crunch Adaptive, a mobile-web platform which works across mobile devices and brings an app like experience in mobile web browser. NGA Technologies Pvt Ltd: It has developed AUTOnCAB, an Android/iOS based mobile application which provides on demand one tap hailing of autorickshaws. The app also calculates distance/fare for a ride. It has the ability to monitor all drivers and rides in real time. Voconow Enterprises: Voconow’s mobile ad-tech product makes static print ads interactive and transactional and transforms them into a sales channel and a revenue centre.

Retail Labs: It has developed Getnow.at which seeks to change how people shop in India by bringing local shopping online. Consumers can order products from stores in their city with guaranteed delivery in six hours. Local stores list their products on our marketplace and the firm handles distribution for them.\\n\\n\\nGoogle story#3: Google Acquires Mobile Startup That Manages Facebook Ads: Google Inc. agreed to acquire Red Hot Labs Inc., a mobile startup that helps companies manage advertising on rival Facebook Inc., bolstering its marketing tools on wireless devices. Red Hot Labs, which provides the Toro service for application developers, will join the mobile ads team at Google, the search giant said, declining to disclose terms of the deal. San Francisco-based Red Hot Labs helps software makers boost their user numbers through Facebook, owner of the world’s largest social-networking service. “With greater resources and distribution now available at our disposal, we’re excited to join Google and continue our mission of making the lives of app developers easier,” the start-up said on its website. Google, expanding beyond its desktop-based tools, is investing in new ways to help companies market on smartphones and tablets as users increasingly access digital services via wireless devices. The Mountain View, California-based company last month reported fourth-quarter sales and profit that missed estimates as its advertising business faced more competition on mobile gadgets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple suffers shock loss in gaming patent infringement suit, ordered to pay $533M to small Texas firm; will appeal: (more coverage here and here)Apple Inc. was told to pay $532.9 million after a federal jury said the company’s iTunes software used a Texas company’s patented inventions without permission. Closely held Smartflash LLC, which claimed that Apple infringed three patents, was seeking $852 million in damages, while Apple said it was worth $4.5 million at most. A federal jury in Tyler, Texas, where Smartflash is based, on Tuesday rejected Apple’s arguments that it didn’t use the inventions and that the patents were invalid. The dispute is over digital rights management and inventions related to data storage and managing access through payment systems. Smartflash claimed that iTunes used the inventions in applications such as Game Circus LLC’s Coin Dozer and 4 Pics 1 Movie. Apple pledged to appeal. “Smartflash makes no products, has no employees, creates no jobs, has no U.S. presence, and is exploiting our patent system to seek royalties for technology Apple invented,” said Kristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman. “We refused to pay off this company for the ideas our employees spent years innovating and unfortunately we have been left with no choice but to take this fight up through the court system.” In asking for $852 million, Smartflash argued it was entitled to a percentage of sales of Apple’s devices, including the iPhone, iPad and Mac computers, that were used to access iTunes. It claimed that Apple had intentionally infringed the patents, in part because one of its executives had been given a briefing on the technology more than a decade ago. “Apple doesn’t respect Smartflash’s inventions,” the company’s lawyer, John Ward of Ward & Smith in Longview, Texas, told the jury. “Not a single witness could be bothered with reviewing the patent.”\\n\\n\\nChina\\'s state procurement agency pushes to buy local; has dropped several global brands from approved lists - Cisco, McAfee and Citrix worst hit: China has dropped some of the world\\'s leading technology brands from its approved state purchase lists, while approving thousands more locally made products, in what some say is a response to revelations of widespread Western cybersurveillance. Others put the shift down to a protectionist impulse to shield China\\'s domestic technology industry from competition. Chief casualty is U.S. network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), which in 2012 counted 60 products on the Central Government Procurement Center\\'s (CGPC) list, but by late 2014 had none, a Reuters analysis of official data shows. Smartphone and PC maker Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has also been dropped over the period, along with Intel Corp\\'s (INTC.O) security software firm McAfee and network and server software firm Citrix Systems (CTXS.O). The number of products on the list, which covers regular spending by central ministries, jumped by more than 2,000 in two years to just under 5,000, but the increase is almost entirely due to local makers. The number of approved foreign tech brands fell by a third, while less than half of those with security-related products survived the cull. An official at the procurement agency said there were many reasons why local makers might be preferred, including sheer weight of numbers and the fact that domestic security technology firms offered more product guarantees than overseas rivals.\\n\\n\\nSalesforce stock up 12%, at all-time high after strong earnings: 2014 revenue $5.3B, +32% Y/Y: Salesforce.com Inc. raised its revenue forecast for fiscal 2016, thanks to Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff’s push into new businesses and bigger deals with long-standing customers. Sales will be $6.48 billion to $6.52 billion, the company said in a statement Wednesday, up from its prior prediction for $6.45 billion to $6.5 billion. Analysts had projected $6.5 billion, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Billings rose 32 percent to $2.54 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Jan. 31, exceeding analysts’ average projection for 25 percent. Salesforce’s expansion into data analytics, corporate social networks and marketing services is starting to deliver results, with sales in the company’s Marketing and Salesforce1 Platform divisions up from prior quarters. President Keith Block, who joined the company in mid-2013, has been leading the push to generate new revenue from large companies, building on Salesforce’s position as the largest maker of customer-management software. The shares of Salesforce rose as much as 12 percent in extended trading. The stock advanced 1.6 percent to $62.90 at the close in New York, leaving it up 6.1 percent this year, compared with a 2.7 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Salesforce’s fourth-quarter net loss narrowed to $65.8 million, or 10 cents a share, from a loss of $116.6 million, or 19 cents, a year earlier. Profit excluding some costs was 14 cents and sales for the period rose 26 percent to $1.44 billion, with both results matching analysts’ predictions. For the just-ended fiscal year, revenue rose 32 percent to $5.37 billion, the third straight period of slowing growth as the business matures.Today after the bell, Salesforce reported $1.44 billion in fourth quarter revenue, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.14. Both were dead in-line with market expectations. The company’s shares are up more than 6 percent in after-hours trading. The company is currently trading at an all-time high. Tomorrow morning should be a watershed moment for the SaaS firm. Is strong guidance pushing Salesforce higher? To a certain extent. The company raised its guidance, but only to levels that match market demands. Salesforce expects $1.48 billion to $1.50 billion in current-quarter revenue. The market expects the company to post $1.5 billion, so, both teams are mostly in agreement. It’s the same story when it comes to the company’s fiscal 2016 (current calendar year), with the company anticipating $6.47 billion to $6.52 billion in top line. The market? $6.5 billion.\\n\\n\\nBuggy Bluetooth and unreliable voice recognition systems are now top drivers of car-buyer dissatisfaction, JD Power survey reveals: As communications systems proliferate in cars, they are becoming the biggest source of aggravation for owners, according to a study by the market research firm J.D. Power. From buggy Bluetooth systems to voice recognition systems that do not recognize voices, the problems with in-car computer systems have surpassed excessive wind noise as the most-cited issue. Of owners who had problems with their Bluetooth systems, 55 percent said their vehicle would not recognize their phone and 31 percent said the phone would not automatically connect when they entered the vehicle. The No. 2 problem was voice recognition systems misinterpreting commands. Effective voice recognition is seen as a critical function in cars if consumers are to be discouraged from distracted driving. Google and Apple are poised to enter the market widely, with new dashboard computer systems that will allow consumers to use their smartphones. The study also showed that technology was playing an increasingly important role in buying decisions. Fifteen percent of new-car buyers said they avoided a model because it lacked certain technological features, up from 4 percent in last year’s study. The study covered 177 specific problems grouped into eight major vehicle systems like exterior, seats, steering, suspension, braking and engine and transmission. J.D. Power then ranked brands by the number of problems reported per 100 vehicles; the lower the number of problems, the higher the ranking.\\n\\n\\nUber is offering UberX free in Seoul in a bid to defuse regulatory pressure; also faces potential of IP blockage in India: Global online car hire service major Uber’s IP address may get blocked in India if it does not obtain a radio taxi licence to ply its cabs in the national capital, according to a The Economic Times report citing unnamed Delhi Transport Department official. This will effectively shut down the company’s operations across all 11 cities in India. U.S. taxi service provider Uber Technologies Inc on Wednesday said it will make its low-cost uberX ride-sharing service available free of charge in Seoul, in its second bid this month to operate legally in South Korea. Uber started charging a fee last year for the taxi-like service, which matches passengers via a smartphone app with private drivers who do not hold commercial transport licenses. Prosecutors subsequently indicted Uber\\'s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, as well as its South Korean unit for violating a law prohibiting individuals or firms without proper commercial licenses from providing or facilitating transportation services. \"We want to actively work towards a consensus, and the first step to that process is switching off the fare,\" Uber\\'s head of north Asia Allen Penn said in a statement. Uber proposed a new registration system for its drivers in South Korea earlier this month in a bid to operate legally. But the transport ministry rejected the proposal and said it would stop the company offering its services. Uber has been the subject of similar regulatory ire in countries around the world, even as it expanded into more than 290 cities. In January, the city of Seoul declared Uber\\'s services illegal and started offering rewards of up to 1 million won ($911) for people who reported private drivers providing transport through the company.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIBM announces plans to build corporate cloud centers in India and other new geographies; IBM shrank employee count 12% last year but is hiring in analytics, the cloud and security: IBM Monday announced at a conference in Las Vegas a series of technologies and investments designed to win business customers over to IBM’s version of modern computing. IBM also said it was opening corporate cloud centers in Australia, Canada, India and Italy. These follow a company effort to best Amazon Web Services, Google and Microsoft by renting computation in more locations. “Mega clouds are great, but not that great if you’re not in their geography,” Mr. Diaz said. Rebalancing workforce: IBM’s employee count shrank 12 percent last year as Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty has tried to reinvent the 103-year-old technology giant into a more nimble competitor. It’s the second straight annual drop for IBM’s workforce, the first two-year decline since 1993 and 1994 when the company was pushed to the edge of bankruptcy. Rometty has been seeking to transform International Business Machines Corp. to keep up with newer competitors in an industry undergoing what she’s called “unprecedented change.” IBM had 379,592 employees at the end of 2014, down 12 percent from a year earlier when the company posted the first decline in a decade, according to a filing Tuesday. Excluding a 35,000 reduction from divestitures, headcount fell about 3.9 percent last year. To help boost earnings-per-share, Rometty has fired and furloughed workers, cut IBM’s tax rate and bought back shares. She has also offloaded less-profitable business units last year, like the low-end server business sold to Lenovo Group Ltd., a customer-care business and the chip-making unit, which IBM paid Globalfoundries Inc. $1.5 billion to take off its hands. “IBM has 15,000 open positions right now, many in areas such as analytics, cloud, security where we are rebalancing skills to meet the evolving needs of our clients,” said Ian Colley, a spokesman for IBM.\\n\\n\\nHP Q4 earnings: $26.8B -5% Y/Y, net income $1.4B, -4% Y/Y; stock down 7% on earnings miss: Meg Whitman, Hewlett-Packard‘s chief executive, says she thinks her company did almost everything well in its most recent fiscal quarter. Except make money. HP shares tumbled about 7 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday, after the release of first-quarter earnings that showed drops in revenue and net income, and flat to lower sales in almost all product areas. The company also sharply lowered its outlook for annual earnings. For the quarter ending Jan. 30, HP reported revenue of $26.8 billion, a fall of 5 percent from a year ago. Net earnings were $1.4 billion, down 4 percent. Using nonstandard accounting popular in the tech business, per-share earnings were 92 cents. The revenue numbers were worse than expected in a survey of Wall Street analysts by Thomson Reuters. They thought HP’s revenue would be $27.3 billion. Per-share were 91 cents. Ms. Whitman said that HP was not cutting back on research and development, despite the lower earnings, and said valuable new products were on the way, particularly in business computing. Another bright area, she said, was HP’s security software business, thanks to the hacking last year on Sony Pictures. While there had been earlier violations of corporate computers, she said, Sony took the business up to a new level. “We’re sold out — 5,000 security professionals.”\\n\\n\\nFacebook active advertisers stand at 2M, up 33% since July 2014 on small-business strength: Facebook Inc said on Tuesday that its active advertisers rose to 2 million, a 33 percent increase from the 1.5 million it had in July 2014. The vast majority of the advertisers, defined as those that have placed an ad on the social media platform in the last 30 days, represent small- and medium-sized business owners. \"Small business owners are really hard to reach and they are not tech savvy usually,\" Facebook\\'s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said in an interview. She added that 30 million small business owners have Facebook pages. Facebook also launched a mobile app for advertisers to use to manage their campaigns. Of Facebook\\'s newly acquired advertisers in the 2014 fourth quarter, 80 percent started by paying for a promoted post. Facebook does not break out the actual number of small business advertisers versus big brands, but they tend to spend on average $5 to $50 a day. That compares to the millions spent annually by big companies. Sandberg said that the fastest areas of growth of small business advertising are in regions of Europe-Middle East-Africa and Asia Pacific. Getting more advertisers onto its platform is critical for Facebook as it tries to increase global share. Facebook\\'s fourth-quarter revenue grew 49 percent to $3.85 billion from the same period a year ago, with mobile accounting for 69 percent of advertising revenue. Google is the worldwide leader in digital advertising market share, at 31.1 percent, according to estimates from research firm eMarketer. But Google\\'s slice has shrunk slightly, down from 33.6 percent in 2013. Facebook, on the other hand, increased its share to 7.8 percent in 2014 from 5.8 percent in 2013, according to eMarketer. It is unknown how many advertisers Google currently has. In 2007, it said it was used by 1 million advertisers.\\n\\n\\nGoogle Guns for Apple in Mobile Payments Race: Google announced on Monday that it has cut a deal with three wireless carriers — AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon — as well as their jointly-owned payments company, Softcard, to have its Google Wallet payment application preinstalled on Android phones sold by the carriers. As part of the deal, Google said, it acquired “technology and intellectual property” from Softcard. The move will allow Google to get its Wallet app in front of a whole lot more people, but it is facing an increasingly crowded field. Last week, Samsung acquired Loop Pay, signaling its move into mobile payments. Apple’s Apple Pay, meantime, has  been available for only a few months but has already signed up dozens of companies that report consumers are finally starting to warm to paying for things with their phones.\\n\\n\\nOpera offers new feature for free access to mobile Web apps: Norway\\'s Opera, whose browser software has helped mobile operators sign up millions of users for free or low-cost Internet access, said on Tuesday it was introducing features that let operators offer subscribers free access to selected apps. Opera Max was first introduced last year for Android smartphone users to download free-of-charge. Opera browser users could gain access to an hour or a day of free time on Facebook or music on Spotify using the software. What\\'s different with the new feature, called Opera Max with App Pass, is that it is no longer confined solely to Opera browser users. Instead, App Pass works with any browser or mobile app that an Android phone user may choose to use.\\n\\n\\nIndia smartphone shipments (distinct from sales to end-customer) fell QoQ in Q4 2014 on holiday-related inventory buildup in Q3: For the first time ever, smartphone shipments fell in India during the last quarter of 2014. The smartphone market contracted by 4 percent, while the feature phone market plummeted by 14 percent in relation to the previous quarter, according to data from the International Data Corporation (IDC). The 64.3 million units shipped by vendors to sales channels in Q4 2014 was also 5 percent lower than the number of phones shipped in the corresponding period of the previous year. This includes both smartphones and feature phones. It’s worth noting here that the contraction was in shipments from phone vendors, and not necessarily in phone sales from retailers. The main reason for the drop in shipments has been attributed to the big inventories built up with sales channels during the third quarter. That was due to the strong surge in sales during the festive season. While the overall phone market contracted by 11 percent quarter-to-quarter, the decline was mainly in feature phones. On the positive side, smartphones formed 35 percent of the overall mobile phone business in Q4 2014, compared to a 13 percent share in the same quarter a year earlier. This confirms a strong shift from feature phones to smartphones. Samsung maintained its leadership position in Q4 2014, with Apple presenting stiff competition, but “online exclusive” brands like Xiaomi are making big inroads in the value-for-money category. Homegrown vendor Micromax shipped fewer phones in Q4 2014 owing to high inventories pumped into sales channels during the previous quarter in the festive season.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba\\'s online mutual fund is struggling as China\\'s appetite for online financial products stagnates:\\xa0Alibaba’s Yuebao, one of the largest online mutual funds in China, started to stagnate and even shrink in 2014. Assets fell from US$92 billion to US$87 billion in the third quarter of last year. A combination of heightened competition, stricter government regulations, and declining interest rates likely contributed to the fund’s dip.China’s appetite for online financial products has slowed dramatically, according to a report from the China Internet Network Information Center (via Xinhua). Products like online mutual funds, peer-to-peer loans, and insurance only showed 2 percent growth in the second half of last year. Between the time these products began to hit the market in early 2013 through the first half of 2014, CNNIC says 12.1 percent of Chinese internet users subscribed to or bought some sort of online financial product, but the rate of growth slowed in the second half of 2014 and only reached about 14 percent. As of December 2014, 78.5 million bought into these non-traditional finance options, up 1.5 million on the previous semester. The initial boom of consumers buying into online financial products stemmed from bottlenecks in the traditional banking system. In contrast to state-owned banks that cater more to businesses and state-owned enterprises, these privately owned and peer-to-peer alternatives offered a much lower barrier to entry. That includes no minimum deposits for mutual funds and loans for people without established credit ratings. \\n\\n\\nApple to spend $1.9 billion on 2 new European data centers: Apple Inc said it would spend 1.7 billion euros ($1.9 billion) to build two data centers in Europe that would be entirely powered by renewable energy and create hundreds of jobs. The company said the centers, in Ireland and Denmark, will power Apple\\'s online services, including the iTunes Store, App Store, iMessage, Maps and Siri for customers across Europe. The investment is set to be evenly divided between the two countries, with the Irish government confirming that 850 million euros would be spent in Ireland. The two data centers are expected to begin operations in 2017.\\n\\n\\nWatch out - Gmail’s Autocomplete is suggesting the wrong addresses: Sending email to the wrong person is probably among the top five most awkward things you can do in a professional context. Whether you’ve accidentally let confidential info slip to a third party or simply aired frustration to someone who doesn’t need to hear it, dealing with mis-sent email is never fun. Hence the frustration coming from Gmail power users dealing with an auto-complete bug in the recipient field. Over the last few days, a number of venture capital and startup folk have come forward with complaints ranging from mild frustration to anger: Google confirmed that there is in fact an issue in Gmail’s auto-complete function. A Google spokesperson gave us the following comment: “We’re aware of an issue with Gmail and auto-complete and currently investigating. Apologies for any inconvenience.”\\n\\n\\nAs Paris forms a special police unit to spot clandestine taxis; Uber gives drivers tips on how to avoid detection: Uber Technologies Inc. drivers in Paris are adding a new word to their vocabulary: Boers. That’s the nickname of a special police unit whose responsibilities include spotting clandestine taxis. The 70-person squad has now the added task of enforcing a taxi law that bans practices including some used by the car-hailing smartphone application’s UberPop rides with unlicensed chauffeurs. Since January, some 110 drivers have been handed tickets. The fines start from a few hundred euros and can theoretically reach several thousands, according to a police official, who asked not to be named citing department policy. In France, where Uber says it has signed up a million users -- including 250,000 for UberPop -- in just over three years, the crackdown is the latest episode in a long legal battle where cab drivers say the startup unfairly threatened their livelihoods. Uber disagrees with the ban, backed by a Paris judge who studied the taxi law and ruled in December not to block the service. To avoid police attention, at least seven UberPop drivers Bloomberg News spoke to in the past week said they had been told by the company not to position their smartphones in plain sight when running the app, and to ask passengers to ride in the front seat. They declined to give their full names for fear of reprimand by Uber. Uber’s Simphal confirmed those guidelines. The company also regularly e-mails newsletters to drivers with advice on regulation and other topics, he said. “We always support the drivers,” Simphal said, when asked whether Uber reimburses them for fine tickets.\\n\\n\\nCircle of Life - LivingSocial spawns a new generation of startups even as it shrinks: The tendency for start-ups to give rise to other start-ups is a self-sustaining cycle that excites technology enthusiasts. It can create a concentration of companies that generate well-paying jobs and attract skilled workers, as well as give well-heeled financiers a reason to invest money in the region. Nowhere is this more evident than Silicon Valley, where high-growth technology companies spin off new ventures, recycle engineering talent and grab billions of dollars from the world’s biggest venture capitalists. It’s the kind of ecosystem, built over decades, that other locales now strive to emulate. LivingSocial’s ability to spawn a next generation of companies may be among its most significant contributions to the local economy, especially as its own promise to become one of the region’s banner tech companies has faded. After raising hundreds of millions of dollars from investors to expand globally, LivingSocial in recent years has shrunk from 4,000 to 1,300 employees worldwide and retreated from countries in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple wants to start producing cars as soon as 2020, and is hiring accordingly: Apple Inc., which has been working secretly on a car, is pushing its team to begin production of an electric vehicle as early as 2020, people with knowledge of the matter said. The timeframe -- automakers typically spend five to seven years developing a car -- underscores the project’s aggressive goals and could set the stage for a battle for customers with Tesla Motors Inc. and General Motors Co. Both automakers are targeting a 2017 release of an electric vehicle that can go more than 200 miles on a single charge and cost less than $40,000. “That’s the inflection point -- the proving ground -- that brings on the electric age,” Steve LeVine, author of “The Powerhouse,” a book about the automotive battery industry, said on Bloomberg TV Thursday. “Now you have Apple coming in and this is critical mass. Was GM really going to be able to match Tesla? Apple can.” Apple, which posted record profit of $18 billion during the past quarter, has $178 billion in cash with few avenues to spend it. The Cupertino, California-based company’s research and development costs were $6.04 billion in the past year, and Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is facing increased pressure to return cash to shareholders. The CEO has been pushing the iPhone maker to enter new categories to further envelop users’ digital lives with Apple’s products and services. Apple’s possible foray into cars follows a similar path it’s taken to break into other industries. The company wasn’t the first to make a digital-music player or smartphone, and only entered those markets once it had a product that redefined those categories. hiring an auto team : A year and a half ago, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) had applied for just eight patents related to auto batteries. Recently, it has hired a bevy of engineers, just one of whom had already filed for 17 in his former career, according to a Thomson Reuters analysis. The recent spate of hires and patent filings reviewed by Reuters shows that Apple is fast building its industrial lithium-ion battery capabilities, adding to evidence the iPhone maker may be developing a car.\\n\\n\\nWinning the Buy Box is at the top of most Amazon retailers’ wish lists; here is a look at how it works; To understand how Amazon views the Buy Box, it’s worth putting yourself in the shoes of a shopper to see how they experience the Buy Box. Let’s imagine that as a buyer you’re searching for a Sony H300 digital camera on Amazon.com and come across the listing below. You go to the product page, and the price is in your range so you click ‘Add to Basket’. You’ve just used Amazon’s Buy Box. Did you pay attention to who was selling this item? Probably not. You assume it’s sold by Amazon. But in this case, it’s not. A third-party seller sells it and Amazon fulfills it. As a consumer, you had 31 other third-party options on this product page, including 8 other Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) offers. Amazon itself wasn’t selling this item through its first-party offering. Now that we know how consumers interact with the Buy Box, we have a clearer picture of how Amazon narrows down eligibility. Over at Amazon, a team is working on deciding Amazon’s Buy Box algorithm. Their mission is to define what buyers consider to be the ‘best’ offer when shopping on the marketplace. It’s truly a customer-centric attitude: Amazon’s top priority is to earn buyers’ trust, as Amazon believes that this maximizes profits in the long term. Predicting which offer is best for consumers at a product’s ASIN level is extremely complex. Amazon can’t allow this formula to be transparent for third-party sellers, and Amazon is okay with that. Overall, Amazons goal isn’t to increase retailers’ trust, but buyers’ trust. Since seller performance requirements can vary by category and are subject to change, Amazon does not disclose specific targets needed to win the Buy Box. However, we do know that becoming eligible requires meeting very high standards. To be in with a chance of winning the Buy Box, excelling in the qualifying criteria of pricing, availability, fulfillment and customer experience is the best way to work toward achieving this status. Pricing: Amazon looks at the total price the customer will pay for a product, including delivery, so make sure you price your products competitively, including the delivery rates. The lowest price doesn’t guarantee winning the Buy Box, as pricing is just one factor that is evaluated. Availability: Make sure you keep stock available, if you have no current stock for a product, you cannot win the Buy Box! Use inventory planning to keep your popular products in stock and make sure you maintain a consistent quantity threshold. Fulfillment: If you can, offer multiple shipping options on your products. Customer Experience: As a customer-centric company, it is no shock that customer metrics play their part in the Buy Box allocation. Make sure you keep on top of your Order Defect Rate, A-to-z claims, returns and other seller performance and delivery metrics (such as lead-time-to-ship time). Time and experience: In most categories you are not eligible for the Buy Box right away. You need to develop your business on Amazon and build a strong, positive reputation before you can qualify for the Buy Box. Your sales history is an important aspect – both number of sales and customer satisfaction on those sales. Amazon’s challenge is not just confirming that buyers prefer offers with low prices, fast delivery and sellers with better feedback. The key is providing each input with a value. To get the Buy Box algorithm right, a lot of testing is needed, with Amazon’s team updating and testing new releases, measuring success by monitoring GMV, unit uplifts and the percentage of items bought so that the best products are available to customers on the Buy Box.\\n\\n\\nMobile app-install ads have fueled the rise of Facebook and Twitter, now Pinterest wants in: Mobile app-install ads have been fundamental to Facebook and Twitter\\'s rise as mobile advertising players over the past two years, and now Pinterest wants in on the action. Last week, Pinterest teamed up with Apple to roll out App Pins—a feature that lets users save and share apps to boards. For example, someone looking for a recipe on Pinterest may see a meal-planning app pop up in search results. Clicking on the posts then lets a user download the app straight from Pinterest. With 75 percent of the social network\\'s traffic coming from mobile, the new tool seems like a natural fit for Pinterest marketers. But Pinterest may also be too late to capitalize on the tactic since Facebook and Twitter are already bolstering their revenues with app-install ads. \"They\\'re definitely a little behind, but there is still a massive opportunity for them to integrate an app-install format,\" said Guillaume Lelait, general manager at mobile marketing agency Fetch. \"Pinterest is different in that users are already coming to the platform with a discovery and purchasing mindset.\" As part of the partnership, social media-averse Apple has also set up an account with a few boards of themed apps. App Pins are the latest attempt from Pinterest to make it easier for users to find things they\\'re interested in. In 2013, the company started packing more text into pins. And last year, Pinterest started testing Promoted Pins—ads that are bought based on keywords. The San Francisco company told The New York Times it doesn\\'t plan to make money off App Pins. But app install ads have been a boon for Facebook and Twitter, and it\\'s hard to imagine that Pinterest isn\\'t interested in tapping into the lucrative opportunity. Mobile accounted for 69 percent (or $2.5 billion) of Facebook\\'s revenue during the fourth quarter, while smartphone and tablet ads generated 85 percent of Twitter\\'s third-quarter ad money. While Pinterest doesn\\'t plan to use its new tool for advertising, a new case study from financial savings app Acorns shows that app-install ads pay off. Acorns launched in August as an app that saves spare change on credit and debit card purchases. Users first link a credit card number to the app, which then rounds up the amount of a transaction to the next dollar. The extra money is then saved away to use later. The financial startup used mobile app install ads on Facebook, Twitter and mobile ad networks to drive downloads of the app. Promoted Tweets on Twitter ran from August to November 2014, targeting money-related keywords. The paid tweets generated a 3 percent engagement rate. \"Basically we were able to find who was our audience and serve the ads directly to them,\" said Sami Khan, director of user acquisition at Acorns. In the first 90 days that Acorns launched, one in five of the company\\'s downloads came from Twitter. The company paid less than $4 per app install, which it claims is significantly lower than the $8 to $10 that financial companies typically pay to acquire users. The Acorns team also experimented with the ad\\'s creative, changing up images on the fly. Khan said pictures that were simple and to the point performed well. \"Twitter ads for mobile app installs work better when they have pictures attached,\" Khan said. \"So we needed to create images that related to our value proposition.\"\\n\\n\\nPinterest is in talks to raise $500M at valuation of $11B, twice its previous valuation: US-based visual discovery startup Pinterest Inc. is in talks to raise $500 million at a valuation of $11 billion, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal , citing sources. The new funding will more than double the valuation of the company from its last round, when it had raised $200 million at $5 billion valuation. To date, Pinterest has raised a total of $764 million in funding from SV Angel, Bessemer Venture Partners, Fidelity, Andreessen Horowitz, FirstMark Capital, and Valiant Capital Partners. In October 2013, Pinterest had raised $225 million led by Fidelity Investments at a valuation of $3.8 billion. Previously, the company had bagged $100 million from Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten.\\n\\n\\nIndia startup action: Payments firm Citrus Pay crosses a milestone: $1B in gross transaction runrate: Citrus claims of having crossed $1 billion in gross transactions as a run rate from its 11 million registered users, according to a top executive of the company. It crossed the milestone in December which means it processed transactions worth over Rs 515 crore in that month. “We process more than 1.6 lakh transactions per day compared with 278 transactions in January 2011 when we started operating,” said Satyen Kothari, co-founder, Citrus. This means it is doing roughly 5 million transactions per month with an average ticket size of around Rs 1,000. It says it now has over 2,500 merchants using its services and it is adding more than 100 every month. Airtel, IndiGo, Sun Direct, Tata AIA, Fun Cinemas, Pepperfry and Delhi Metro are among its clients. The firm charges 2.5 per cent fee of the transaction from the merchants, which means it is now generating around Rs 13 crore as net revenues a month. The firm has launched direct-to-consumer app which is a personal payments manager that tracks, pays & reminds users of their bills. Called Cube, it gives a dashboard on what’s late, what’s due and what’s already paid. “Most Indian pay about 8-10 bills every month. RBI has estimated that Indians pay 30 billion bills in a year. These could be paid by physical means or going online on different websites which is a waste of time. Going to banks for paying it is not meant for our fast moving lifestyle and so we came up with Cube,” said Kothari. “Besides paying bills, it can create analytical graphs that helps the user track spending habits, brings exhaustive billing history to the users fingertips and ‘automagically’ adds reminders for payments made by users,” he explained. For circumstances where users cannot pay through the app, the tracking history does not break as it also allows users to manage bills that are paid offline or on other sites by manually adding that data. The unique quotient is that it also allows users to track micro bills like maid’s salary etc and make notes. The app also allows users to ask friends or spouse to pay for it. Presently, the app operates in seven categories including mobile, DTH, power, credit card, data card, landline and gas and also other miscellaneous categories. This is the company’s second direct-to-consumer app. It had earlier launched an app called Death of Chutta which allows users to exchange money with friends. The money in that wallet can also be used to pay across 700 portals which Citrus has partnered. According to the founder, these products were launched for making India’s digital currency. The idea is also to gear up for the payments banking license, for which it has applied. “There are infinite things that we can do with the consumer’s money. Right now we are restricted to Rs 5000 per transaction and Rs 10,000 per month which really hits the ceiling to how much we can automate and innovate very fast. With the license, we can hold up to Rs 1 lakh,” said Kothari. In December 2013, the Mumbai-based company had raised about $5.5 million from econtext Asia Ltd, a Japanese online payments firm, and Beenos Asia Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of Japanese e-commerce and incubation company Netprice, with participation from existing investor Sequoia Capital. Prior to that, it has raised $1.8 million from Sequoia Capital in January 2012. Citrus competes with CCAvenues, ibibo Group’s PayU, One97’s Paytm Payments, ZaakPay and PayPal.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",
      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA Year Later, $19 Billion For WhatsApp Doesn’t Sound So Crazy: Without WhatsApp, Facebook’s international situation would look a lot dicier. And if a competitor like Google acquired it instead, it could have been disastrous. Instead, Facebook possess the most popular messaging app, and has neutralized the biggest threat to its global domination of social networking. No apps get opened as often as messaging apps. While you might spend longer in total scrolling through Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or Pinterest, the frequent short sessions with chat apps make them a vector for other experiences. That means they’re more valuable than they might first appear. How do you monetize chat? It’s a tough question. Sure there’s stickers, but there’s too much competition to charge much upfront for an app and its too interruptive to show ads. But platforms, hubs, portals — whatever you want to call them — hold plenty of opportunities to cash in. The messaging apps from Asia are proving this as we speak. China’s WeChat also lets you call a taxi, pay friends, search, shop, buy movie tickets, and more. Japan’s Line hosts Line Pay, Line TV, and an identity platform for games. Why fumble with a bunch of different apps, passwords, and payment methods when you can do it all while you chat? Even Snapchat is expanding far beyond messaging. Its Stories product for broadcasting sequences of photos and videos is a hit with star content creators. Its Snapcash feature lets you quickly pay friends through Square Cash. And its new Discover portal collects Snap-formatted content from premium producers like Comedy Central, CNN, ESPN, and Vice. A lot of critics wondered how Facebook could earn money from messaging on WhatsApp, considering it’s vowed not to show ads and only charges its skimpy $1 subscription fee in a few markets. The answer is it doesn’t have to. By taking a cut of commerce, or charging for promotion of content, it could keep chat lean and clean while monetizing other parts.\\n\\n\\nHP becomes a reseller of networking equipment; move away from hardware in quest of software-company margins takes aim at Cisco: Hewlett-Packard said on Thursday that it would sell a new line of networking switches that are manufactured by a Taiwanese company and depend on Linux-based, open-source software from another company. HP, once at the center of high-tech manufacturing, will not make the new networking equipment but will act as a reseller, providing both online ordering and worldwide support for the product. It is the most consequential announcement from HP since its chief executive, Meg Whitman, announced last October that the company would split into two separate enterprises. One will be focused on business, and the other on consumer-type products. The networking move, firmly in the area of business technology, shows the type of changes HP and other older tech giants must make to survive in a transforming marketplace. In its last fiscal year, HP took in $2.6 billion from its proprietary networking business, which started in earnest in 2009. In the long term, cheap, open-source networking equipment could threaten HP’s existing business, particularly if the open-source products make expected gains in power and capability. HP is not the only networking equipment maker threatened by the changing marketplace. Cisco Systems is still by far the biggest maker of networking gear, with $47 billion in annual revenue, and it depends heavily on proprietary products. Networking gear has been considered an important part of HP’s future, however. “We see a shift,” said Mark Carroll, the chief technology officer of HP’s networking business. “The traditional market, the one-vendor market, is transitioning to many suppliers.” By offering an open-source product consisting largely of mass-market chips, the thinking runs, HP will be in a position to dislodge Cisco. Mr. Carroll called HP’s embrace of open source “an evolution” of his company’s strategy. “You look at which markets are growing and go there,” he said. Sold complex and proprietary combinations of servers, data storage, networking and software for decades, customers are now demanding systems that can be arranged in different ways, with open-source software they can tinker with in-house. The new methods promise advantages in speed, cost and innovation. In addition, new entrants are affecting the business. Companies now rely on Amazon’s computing-rental business for many needs. Facebook last week announced an open-source switch intended to undermine prices and speed innovation in the industry. Mr. Carroll said HP “absolutely” sees Facebook’s switch “playing in the same space” as HP’s open-source networking. The actual manufacturer of the HP boxes, Accton Technology, has been making gear for HP for 20 years. The open-source software will be supplied by Cumulus Networks, which last year announced it would supply Dell with software for inexpensive networking boxes. The Cumulus relationship with HP is not exclusive, and HP could add more suppliers in the future. HP “wants the software and service margins and to get rid of being in the hardware business,” said JR Rivers, chief executive and one of the founders of Cumulus. “You’ll see other networking providers get on board with this.” The initial target customers for the product, available in March, are telecommunications and financial companies. Both use a lot of cloud computing, mobility, social media and big-data resources in their data centers.\\n\\n\\nBeing fully transparent in pricing can be costly, finds online ticket seller StubHub : In January 2014, StubHub attempted something radical. Addressing the frustration of its customers, the online ticket reseller began including its bevy of fees in the first price a customer sees, rather than tacking them on just before purchase. Now when you click “buy,” a pair of tickets listed at $100 will cost $100, not $125. According to StubHub, customers said they wanted—and say they love—the transparency. But the change hasn’t improved sales. Because StubHub, which generated $500 million in revenue last year, baked its fees into the list price, its tickets looked more expensive than those of rivals. Sales for the company fell more than 10 percent in the months that followed the pricing change, according to Wedbush Securities, as competitor Ticketmaster gained market share. StubHub further trimmed its profit margins by cutting its take from each sale. By November, Chris Tsakalakis, who championed the new pricing, was out as president. (He declined to comment.) Still, the ticket reseller has stuck with the policy, which spokesman Glenn Lehrman says is among the most popular moves the 15-year-old company has ever made.\\n\\n\\nStartups continue to try and crack the attribution problem of omnichannel shoppers and cross-device conversions: The proliferation of smartphones and tablets has given rise to the “omnichannel shopper,” a retail industry term for a customer who might scope out a product from their phone, computer and local store before making a purchase. Major retailers are waging advertising wars across an increasing number of screens and storefronts in an effort to win these shoppers’ business. After all, that customer could decide to buy at any point. But serial entrepreneurs Hemang Gadhia and Christopher Brown discovered a simple albeit significant problem: Retailers have a hard time tracking when that customer using their app, visiting their Web site and entering their store is actually the same person. The pair’s latest venture, District-based Revmetrix, uses software to identify omnichannel shoppers as they move from smartphone to computer to tablet to store, then helps retailers determine what will motivate that specific customer to actually spend money. How will Revmetrix track omnichannel shoppers? Data, of course. As customers visit retailers online and in stores, they leave digital footprints along the way, such as the make and model of a smartphone, an IP address and a geographic location. That information can then be matched with information the retailer may already collect about its customers, such as their online shopping habits, purchase history and demographic data. At present, Gadhia said the Revmetrix software can identify the same customer on different devices with more than 80 percent accuracy. The more data that’s collected, the more accurate the technology becomes. “The problem that we’re solving is a problem that exists for every single large retailer on the planet,” Gadhia said.\\n\\n\\nFlipkart is valued at more than AirBnB, as billion-dollar startups proliferate; as Snapchat proves, though, these rankings change very quickly though: Flipkart Internet Pvt. is now valued at $11 billion, making it the fifth-most valuable startup on the list. That puts Flipkart ahead of Airbnb, a company that is challenging the business models of global hotel giants with its online room rentals, and online storage firm Dropbox. These rankings are volatile though: Less than 12 months after investors valued Snapchat, the red-hot messaging app, at about $10 billion, the start-up is again in the market for money — and poised to nearly double that valuation. A range of other popular start-ups are also poised to propel their net worths to similar multibillion-dollar heights, including the virtual scrapbooking service Pinterest and the ride-hailing app Lyft. Uber, Lyft’s top competitor, has raised more than $3 billion in the last year and now has an eye-popping valuation of $40 billion. Giant sums of money and sky-high valuations are nothing new in the technology industry. But the latest burst of activity has put on clear display the frenzied pace of investors, who are eager to catch the next blockbuster company like Facebook. The action is also again spurring talk that overeager investors are poised to relive the dot-com boom and bust at the turn of the century, when overinflated start-ups led to a quick and painful downturn. For investors, the hunt is for the next proverbial so-called unicorn, a nascent business worth $1 billion or more — on paper, at least. Just last year, 38 privately held companies backed by venture capital joined the billion-dollar club, putting the membership of that group at 54, according to the data firm CB Insights. Digi-Capital, a mobile Internet advisory firm, estimates that the total value of mobile Internet start-ups worth $1 billion or more increased $28 billion in just the last quarter of 2014.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber expands Series E by $1B to $2.8B; Baidu among investors as Alibaba invests in rival Lyft:\\xa0Facing overwhelming demand from institutional investors, Uber has expanded its Series E round of venture financing by $1 billion, according to documents filed Wednesday with the Delaware secretary of state, bringing the total capacity for the round up to $2.8 billion. The move, which was confirmed by Uber, occurred just weeks after the company closed a $1.2 billion round of financing. At the time, Uber said it had left capacity for about $600 million in additional strategic investments, according to a Delaware filing. The company is incorporated in Delaware and based in San Francisco. But the appetite for a piece of Uber has proved to be greater than the company had imagined. The $600 million was quickly oversubscribed, and Uber decided to raise the amount. Baidu, the Chinese Internet giant, accounts for part of the additional investment beyond the $1.2 billion round. The most recent expansion is on top of some $4 billion Uber raised, including a recent $1.6 billion round of convertible debt financing from the clients of the private wealth arm of Goldman Sachs, the investment bank previously confirmed. Uber’s $40 billion valuation, extraordinary by any private technology company’s standards, remains unchanged since the company announced the first part of the round in December. Uber is one of the most richly valued private technology start-ups, second only to Xiaomi, the Chinese smartphone manufacturer. Meanwhile, Uber’s largest United States competitor is also raising money. Lyft, identified by its signature pink mustache logo, is trying to raise at least $250 million in private capital, with participation from at least one previous investor, the Alibaba Group of China.\\n\\n\\nGoogle is set to launch a subscription model for YouTube in a few months, CNBC quoted Robert Kyncl, the online video service\\'s head of content and business operations as saying at the Code/Media conference. The company was \"fine-tuning the experience\", Kyncl said at the conference in California. (cnb.cx/1zOXElH) YouTube has been exploring a paid, ad-free version of its service for some time. The company launched a pilot program in May 2013 that allowed individual content creators to charge consumers a subscription fee to access a particular \"channel\" of videos. The plan would represent a significant change for the world\\'s No. 1 online video, whose free videos, often accompanied by short commercials, attract more than 1 billion users a month.\\n\\n\\nSnapdeal aims for $2B in fashion in 2015; acquires designer apparel e-tailer Exclusively.com: E-commerce major Snapdeal.com, run by Delhi-based Jasper Infotech Pvt Ltd, has acquired Indian luxury and lifestyle products site Exclusively.com (formerly Exclusively.in). The financials of the deal are not disclosed. According to Snapdeal, the acquisition has been made with an aim to strengthen its fashion business and reach $2 billion in gross merchandise volume (GMV) in the category in 2015. “We have witnessed a surge in the demand from consumers across the country for premium and luxury products. However, given that access to luxury brands is limited in our country, we have acquired Exclusively to provide our users with access to a range of aspirational, high end products and services,” said Kunal Bahl, co-founder and CEO, Snapdeal.com. As part of the acquisition, Exclusively will complement Snapdeal’s existing ecosystem and will provide a consolidated offering for the luxury and lifestyle shopper. It will continue to function as an independent site and all aspects of Exclusively’s online shopping experience will remain intact — with new collection and service augmentations in the pipeline. Snapdeal on the other hand will help the company scale up and expand its current business and reach. As of now, Exclusively retails products from designers like Manish Malhotra, Tarun Tahiliani, Manish Arora, Anita Dongre, Rohit Bal,  Shivan & Narresh, Gaurav Gupta, JJ Valaya, Ritu Kumar, Varun Bahl, and Neeta Lulla, to name a few. This year, the company plans to launch leading international luxury brands and designers on its site. Founded in June 2010, Exclusively.com offers products in a number of categories including apparels, jewellery, handbags and accessories. While it started off targeting the US and the UK markets, the company now caters to the Indian market. Interestingly, the company was reported to have been acquired by fashion portal Myntra.com in 2012. At the time, Myntra had acquired Shersingh.com. The two sites (Shersingh.com and Exclusively.com) were functioning under the same umbrella back then. Exclusively.com could not be reached out to for an immediate response.\\n\\n\\nSamsung Buys LoopPay, a Competitor to Apple’s Mobile Wallet: Samsung, the South Korean technology giant, announced Wednesday it had acquired LoopPay, a mobile payments company, signaling its interest in controlling smartphone-based purchases. The move comes just months after the release of Apple Pay, Apple’s mobile payments product, which allows consumers to buy things with little more than a wave of a smartphone. Though it has been available for only a handful of months, Apple Pay has gained significant traction with retailers and consumers. Whole Foods, the high-end grocery store, said it had processed thousands of Apple Pay transactions. Apple has also persuaded dozens of credit card issuers to sign up to support Apple Pay. LoopPay, however, believes its reach will extend far beyond that of Apple Pay. LoopPay’s underlying technology relies on a magnetic transmission sent from a user’s phone to a merchant’s payment terminal, mimicking a credit card swipe. The technology, according to LoopPay, can be accepted in more than 90 percent of existing point-of-sale terminals. It is unclear if LoopPay will work on chip-and-pin terminals, which use a more secure form of credit card technology and are being widely phased in this year. Apple Pay relies on near-field communication technology, which Apple says is available at approximately 220,000 American locations. MST v NFC:  LoopPay uses magnetic secure transmission (MST) tech works with around 90 percent of existing payment terminals currently deployed in U.S. stores. “If you look at other competitor solutions in mobile payments [Apple Pay included], it’s actually based on near-field technology, which has very limited coverage in the U.S. We see the MST technology that LoopPay owns has a lot of potential to really solve the end-user coverage issues with respect to point-of-sale terminals.” Samsung spotted the potential early: LoopPay launched a Kickstarter project in November of 2013, and was contacted by Samsung only “shortly thereafter,” according to Graylin.\\n\\n\\nWhy Google Should Fear Facebook\\'s New Product Ads Social network\\'s targeting threatens retail search dominance: Yesterday, Facebook revealed that it\\'s starting to serve ads for retailers\\' goods that use the targeting and personal-interest information it has on its 1.4 billion users. These product ads are an answer to a service that Google has offered businesses since 2013 with Shopping Ads (which were initially called Product Listing Ads). Google Shopping Ads show up as paid posts atop retailer-focused search results and render pictures and prices of items for sale. They are highly visual compared with text-based search results and have become a lucrative piece of Google\\'s search business. In fact, according to Q4 2014 research from Adobe Digital Index, 20 percent of clicks on Google search links for retailers were on Shopping Ads. Also, Adobe said that merchants spent 47 percent more on Google Shopping Ads year-over-year last quarter, meanwhile they decreased spending on text-based ads by 6 percent during the same period. The interest in the format, which entails more dynamic creative, shows how digital advertisers prefer more visual marketing over simple text. Now, Facebook has the opportunity to mimic that success with its troves of consumer data while siphoning from its rival\\'s digital dollars. Its product ads will let businesses zero in on users based on elements such as clothing preferences, musical tastes and location. \"Facebook has the best targeting capabilities, so it can take some of the limelight from shopping ads on Google,\" said Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst for Adobe Digital Index (ADI). Facebook has made dynamic visuals a priority—not just with its new product ads—but with the whole design of the platform, encouraging more video and photos. And there\\'s a bottom-line reason behind such moves. Gaffney and her ADI team\\'s quarterly research last month read: \"Advertisers are gravitating toward creating an image-based Web shopping experience for consumers. Facebook is also attracting more retailers, which means there will be a likely increase in demand for more effective shopping ads. By the second half of 2015, Adobe predicted that shopping ads will account for 30 percent of all search dollars. Also, Google and Facebook are not alone going for that market—Yahoo and Bing have a version; however, for now they control only a small market share.\\n\\n\\nChinese online education startup raises $100M: On the eve of the Chinese new year, online education platform 17zuoye has announced that it has raised a series D round worth US$100 million, according to Duozhi. This brings the company’s total valuation to US$600 million. The round was led by H Capital (which also invested in 17zuoye’s series C), and other investors included Temasek, Yuri Milner/DST, and Lei Jun’s Shunwei (which has invested in every 17zuoye round starting with its series A). 17zuoye is an online learning platform for students K-12, as well as teachers and parents. The name means “homework together” in Chinese, and the site aims to serve as a nexus for all three groups to facilitate the educational experience, focusing on English and Math classes. For example, for students one service it offers is an automated system that allows them to record English sentences and get instant feedback on pronunciation. Teachers can then listen to their students’ recordings at any time. Parents can even get real-time reports on their kids via WeChat. Online education is a hot market in China right now, but 17zuoye, which was founded in 2007, has shown especially explosive growth. Two years ago the site had just over 1 million students; now it has more than 7 million. In July of last year alone, for example, the site added more than 130,000 students to its rolls.\\n\\n\\nSony seeks to re-invent itself: sees 25-fold profit jump by 2018; could exit TVs, phones:  Sony aims to boost operating profit 25-fold within three years by growing its camera sensors and PlayStation units, its chief executive said, outlining a strategy that could see the company exit the cut-throat TV and smartphone sectors. CEO Kazuo Hirai said on Wednesday the Japanese consumer electronics firm would no longer pursue sales growth in areas such as smartphones where its has suffered competition from cheaper Asian rivals as well as industry leaders like Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS). Sony would instead focus its spending on more profitable businesses such as camera sensors, videogames and entertainment as it seeks to return to growth after forecasting for this financial year its sixth net loss in seven years. The comments, made just as the Tokyo market was closing, helped Sony\\'s shares (SNE.N) rise 1.4 percent in New York. \"The strategy starting from the next business year will be about generating profit and investing for growth,\" Hirai told a briefing, adding that Sony\\'s units would be given greater autonomy to make their own business decisions. Asked about the TV and mobile phone units, Hirai said he would not \"rule out considering an exit strategy\", Sony\\'s clearest statement to date about the possibility of selling or finding partners for these struggling units. Sony is in the midst of a restructuring that has so far seen it sell off its personal computer division and spin off the TV business. It has also axed thousands of jobs. Sony shares have risen more than 80 percent over the past year as investors applauded the restructuring, which accelerated since Hirai appointed Kenichiro Yoshida as his chief strategy officer in late 2013. Hirai said Sony would target return on equity of more than 10 percent by the end of March 2018, adopting a yardstick Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been promoting as a way to attract foreign investors. He also said Sony aimed to post an operating profit of at least 500 billion yen ($4.2 billion) for 2017/18, a jump from the 20 billion yen forecast for the year ending March 31. Sony\\'s revamp is starting to pay off. This month, it forecast an operating profit instead of a loss for the financial year ending March 31. But it still expects to book a net loss in 2014/15, albeit a smaller amount than previously estimated.\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft seeks to re-invent itself: has suddenly gotten serious with mobile. This is the same Microsoft that spent almost a half-decade trying to offer a credible alternative to Apple’s iPhone and mobile devices running Google’s Android. And it’s the same Microsoft that paid more than $7 billion to buy Nokia’s once-mighty handset business, only to see its mobile business sink further. The company now clings precariously to a 3 percent share of new smartphone sales. Make no mistake, Microsoft still wants its mobile operating system, Windows, to be the software in our smartphones. But mobile developers continue to focus on making apps for Apple or Android devices instead, making Windows phones an increasingly hard sell. That reality has finally sunk in at Microsoft, and a new strategy is afoot. When Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, took the top job at the company about a year ago, he signaled that the company’s priorities were shifting. Microsoft, he said, was in a “mobile-first, cloud-first world.” Since then, the company has brought more of its apps and services to the Apple and Android devices people actually use, rather than the ones Microsoft would like them to use — those that run Windows. What’s even more surprising is that Microsoft’s heart seems to be in the effort. Over the last several months, Microsoft has been taking up more and more space on my own iPhone’s home screen. I’ve installed mobile versions of its Office apps as well as OneDrive, the company’s answer to Dropbox, Google Drive and other cloud storage services.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWinds of economic change in India: as rivals falter, India’s economy is surging ahead: China’s economy is slowing. Brazil is struggling as commodity prices plunge. Russia, facing Western sanctions and weak oil revenue, is headed into a recession. As other big developing markets stumble, India is emerging as one of the few hopes for global growth. The stock market and rupee are surging. Multinational companies are looking to expand their Indian operations or start new ones. The growth in India’s economy, long a laggard, just matched China’s pace in recent months. India is riding high on the early success of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a raft of new business-friendly policies instituted in his first eight months. Small factories no longer need to shut down every year for government inspectors to spend a day checking boilers. Foreign investment rules have been relaxed for insurers, military contractors and real estate companies. A broad tax overhaul is underway. Renewed optimism from outside investors is spurring business expansion in cities around the country like Tiruppur, a hub of India’s yarn and textile industry. “Most of the factories in Tiruppur are doubling or tripling their capacity, and these are huge factories,” said Pritam Sanghai, the director of Arjay Apparel Industries.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba\\'s stock price has dipped below its first day close; is down 27% from its Nov 2014 peak: Alibaba, which held one of last year’s most high-profile initial public offerings, has drawn investors wanting to benefit from e-commerce traffic in China, the world’s largest Internet market. The company has come under pressure from shareholders in recent weeks after it reported quarterly revenue that failed to meet analysts’ estimates. The stock fell 2.5 percent to $86.85 at Tuesday’s close in New York, less than the closing price of $93.89 on Sept. 19, its first day of trading, though still above the initial sale price of $68. Starboard Value LP, an activist hedge fund, also acquired an Alibaba stake of 400,000 shares in the fourth quarter. The investor earlier took a stake in Yahoo! Inc., which owns about 15 percent of Alibaba, and pushed for the Web portal to monetize the stake in a tax-friendly manner. Last month, Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo said it would spin off the Chinese holdings in a deal that should wrap up by the end of the year. Hedge fund Tiger Global Management acquired 5.8 million shares, or 0.24 percent of Hangzhou, China-based Alibaba, at the end of last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sands Capital Management more than doubled its stake to 19.6 million shares, or 0.8 percent. T. Rowe Price reduced its holdings by 17 percent to 22.3 million shares, a 0.9 percent stake.\\n\\n\\nSnapchat seeking $500M in funding, at $19B valuation; would make it the 3rd most valuable venture-backed firm, after Xiaomi and Uber: (More coverage here and here) Snapchat is looking to raise as much as $500 million in a new funding round that would value the mobile messaging company at up to $19 billion, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing a person with knowledge of the matter. The latest valuation is a massive increase for the company, which Facebook Inc offered to buy for $3 billion in late 2013. Snapchat\\'s previous funding round, completed late last year, valued the company at more than $10 billion. Executives of the company, which allows its more than 100 million users to send messages that disappear after a few seconds, are in advanced talks with fund managers, the person told Bloomberg. (bloom.bg/1AiWtif) The investments being discussed would value Snapchat between $16 billion and $19 billion overall, Bloomberg reported. The drastic increase in valuation comes as Snapchat continues to add to its active user base and extends its service. Last month it added videos and articles by mainstream media outlets such as CNN and ESPN, bringing Snapchat into closer competition with Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc. It is also the latest evidence of a surge in venture capital financing for technology companies, that has produced some eye-popping valuations. Even at $19 billion, Snapchat would only be the third-most valuable tech startup that does not trade its shares publicly. According to research firm CB Insights, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi is worth $46 billion and app-based taxi service Uber is valued at $41 billion.\\n\\n\\nKickstarter secret to its reputation for accurate reviews: Lots of human intervention: Kickstarter Sheds Some Light On The Mechanics Of Its Semi-Automated Review Process Kickstarter has provided a look at how the reconfigured review system the put in place last year has worked out for them, providing some counterarguments to the opinion held in some corners of the Internet that Kickstarter has done away with a review system entirely, throwing open the gates to the wildlings of the north and other nefarious characters. In fact, Kickstarter says that the new process still results in the vast majority of projects submitted getting in front of human eyes, based on over six months’ worth of data. The system uses an algorithm as a first line of automated review, which is designed to select for things that are mostly cookie-cutter and overwhelmingly likely to get the nod form a real person anyway, according to the site. That means that of 69,015 submissions made since the introduction of this system, 27,897 were cleared by the algorithm for direct activation, and a further 6,265 of those actually requested human feedback from Kickstarter before pressing the big green button, meaning only 31 percent of projects launched without human involvement post-approval process change. That leaves 69 percent of projects benefiting from some kind of human intervention, and Kickstarter wants users to know that the human side is still a key part of what it’s offering. The blog post detailing the pool of stats from Yancey Strickler also talks about how the algorithm in use is continually being refined, and the purpose of it in the first place was to free up human reviewer time to give them more attention to offer help when and where it’s most needed. A recent investigative report from Yahoo! Tech’s Dan Tynan found that Kickstarter was the most resistant to attempts to create fake funding campaigns aimed at potentially defrauding backers, and with this much human intervention it begins to make sense why. But that doesn’t change the fact that Kickstarter can often resemble a pre-order mechanism, despite the fact that it very clearly isn’t.\\n\\n\\nApple orders 5-6M watches from its Asian suppliers: Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has asked its Asian suppliers to make 5-6 million units of its three Apple Watch models for the first-quarter, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Taiwan-based Quanta Computer Inc (2382.TW), the sole assembler of the Apple Watch, started mass production earlier this year to get ready for an April launch, the Journal said. (on.wsj.com/17MpwkR) Thousands will work round the clock during the Chinese New Year holidays at Quanta\\'s factory in Changshu, China, the newspaper reported, quoting one person. Apple said it does not comment on rumor or speculation. The iPhone maker\\'s shares rose as much as 1.9 percent to a record $129.45 on the Nasdaq on Tuesday morning. The entry-level Apple Watch Sport model accounts for half the production order, while the mid-tiered Apple Watch will count for a third, one person told the WSJ. The high-end Apple Watch Edition with 18-karat gold casing, is expected to have relatively small orders in the first quarter, but Apple plans to produce more than 1 million units per month in the second quarter, the Journal reported, citing the person. The Apple Watch, starting at $349, can receive phone calls and messages, play music, serve as a digital wallet to pay for goods and monitor heart rates via special sensors.\\n\\n\\nFacebook edges yet closer to eCommerce with Dynamic Product Ads for Data-Minded Retailers: Merchants like Target can upload catalogs and then zero in on consumers.Facebook is giving Target and other retailers a new way to market to its 1.4 billion users. It\\'s called product ads—yet another ad format that Facebook says sets it apart from rivals like Google because it can harness the social network\\'s popularity and behavioral and location data on consumers. The Menlo Park, Calif.-based company announced the marketing offering today, calling product ads \"a solution designed to help businesses promote multiple products, or their entire catalogs, across all the devices their customers use: phones, tablets and desktop computers.\"  Businesses will be able to upload their product catalogs and let Facebook generate ads for items while targeting them to users. These product ads could rival Google\\'s shopping ads, which have evidently performed well for retailers in search. In a blog post, Facebook explained further: \"Advertisers can curate ads as they see fit. For instance, they can highlight products that were viewed on their website/mobile app or showcase best-selling products. Or they can create a multi-product ad that highlights the different benefits of a single product.\" Like Google, Facebook\\'s system will also recognize when products are out of stock and stop advertising them. Target and Shutterfly are among the first merchants testing Facebook product ads.\\n\\n\\nJCPenney\\'s 4 Cent Video Ads on Twitter Could Threaten YouTube\\'s Longtime Dominance Retailer shows how social is changing: JCPenney\\'s Twitter was behind its most successful social program—not Facebook or YouTube—and credited the platform\\'s new video creation and viewing capabilities. The retailer only paid 4 cents for every view, an astoundingly low sum for digital video ads. Ad industry insiders familiar with social media rates said video ads elsewhere cost up to $1 a view. \"Some brands are seeing 2 cents per view on Twitter, which is very effective,\" said one ad industry exec not authorized to speak about rates on the record. JCPenney\\'s holiday campaign \"Just Got Jingled\" featured videos of customers receiving surprise gifts from strangers in stores. Needless to say, the Internet is fond of such random acts of kindness, even when they are part of a branded marketing stunt. The retailer caught the results on camera and promoted them on Twitter, which recently developed in-app, native video tools. Twitter CEO Dick Costolo has made video capabilities for brands, celebrities, media and everyday users a priority, which is why the company bought SnappyTV last year and Niche last week. The former is a technology that powers Twitter\\'s in-house video, and the latter manages Web celebrities to help them make money by selling ads against their videos. In its JCPenney report, Twitter revealed a rare peek at how one of its first Promoted Video ad campaigns performed. Here\\'s how it worked: JCPenney let strangers pick fellow shoppers in stores and paid for their items at checkout.  The retailer promoted the videos on Twitter and targeted them based on users\\' shopping profiles and interest in holiday deals. The retailer sent promoted tweets to Twitter users discussing the holidays, and adjusted messaging on the fly. The video generated more than 3 million views on the social media site (more than on YouTube), according to JCPenney. At 4 cents a view, the campaign would add up to about $120,000. Nine out of 10 impressions were unpaid, organic tweets viewed by users without the promoted tag. There were 16 million impressions, in all, on the promoted tweet.\\n\\n\\nSamsung has $56B in cash, and is looking to do acquisitions rather than return money to investors: Samsung Electronics Co Ltd aims to use its $56 billion cash pile to fund growth including acquisitions, the tech giant\\'s investor relations chief said, even as more shareholders clamor for bigger dividends. While the South Korean company\\'s profit declined in 2014 for the first time in three years as its lead in smartphones was challenged by Apple Inc, investors were cheered by a 40 percent dividend boost and its first share buyback since 2007. But Robert Yi, Samsung\\'s head of investor relations, signaled that shareholders should not expect the same in 2015 as the company keeps its focus on growth. \"Dividends and other forms of shareholder returns are responsibilities that the company has for shareholders, so we will make efforts to meet them. But our primary objective is growth and that is what we are communicating to our shareholders,\" Yi told Reuters in an interview. Samsung has become an increasingly active shopper, striking 10 deals in two years. Even so, its purchases have been small, prompting calls from some investors for bigger deals to revive growth momentum. \"We are primarily focused on M&A deals for companies that would be good fits to Samsung\\'s current businesses, and we believe that know-how and experience accrued from such transactions will make bigger M&A deals possible going forward,\" Yi said. Samsung Electronics held cash of 61.8 trillion won ($56.14 billion) at the end of 2014.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWi-fi first telcos might be about to disrupt the telecom business:\\xa0It would not be an insult to say Republic Wireless and FreedomPop are obscure little companies. But they dream big. The two companies are at the forefront of a tantalizing wireless communications concept that has proved hard to produce on a big scale: Reduce cellphone costs by relying on strategically placed Wi-Fi routers. And when there are no routers available, fall back on the traditional cellular network. They have been at this for nearly five years with mixed success. The companies say they are already profitable and gradually adding subscribers. But they are tiny — both say their customers are in the hundreds of thousands. Verizon Wireless, by comparison, has more than 100 million. Still, the upstarts have been trailblazers, proof that alternative wireless networks are feasible and maybe even profitable. Now some giant companies look to be following their lead. Last month, Cablevision announced a phone service that would be powered entirely by Wi-Fi, for $30 a month, while a traditional wireless contract costs around $100 a month. Google has also been working on a cellphone service that relies heavily on Wi-Fi, according to people briefed on the company’s plans. For consumers, all this could be very good news. The big American carriers — Verizon Wireless, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile USA — have not been worried about their Wi-Fi-powered competitors. But Cablevision and Google could force them to pay attention. And an industry already engaged in a price-cut war could be compelled to go even lower to keep the upstarts at bay. “Wi-Fi first is a massive disrupter to the current cost structure of the industry,” said Stephen Stokols, chief executive of FreedomPop. “That’s going to be a big shock to the carriers.” The concept championed by the two little companies in their nationwide services is surprisingly simple. The traditional wireless carriers operate their services with cell towers, but occasionally in areas with extra heavy traffic they resort to Wi-Fi to bear some of the load. FreedomPop and Republic Wireless do the opposite. They offer services that rely primarily on Wi-Fi networks, and in areas without Wi-Fi, customers can pull a signal from regular cell towers.\\n\\n\\nInfosys acquires SaaS provider Panaya in deal valued at $200M: Consulting and IT services provider Infosys announced today that it will acquire Panaya, an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software company. Worth an enterprise value of about $200 million, the deal is expected to close by the end of March.Infosys, which is based in Bengaluru, India, said that it will integrate technology from Panaya’s CloudQuality suite to bring automation to some of its software. CloudQuality helps businesses test changes to SAP, Oracle EBS, and Salesforce software by identifying functions that might break and providing potential solutions including code corrections. Infosys, one of India’s largest software exporters, is currently in the midst of revamping its strategy as it faces challenges including slower revenue growth than competitors like HCL Tech and TCS, and the departure of several key executives. Sikka told TechCrunch’s Ron Miller last July that he would take time to understand Infosys’ problems and that he believes software solutions should be about expanding the knowledge and capability of an organization. According to Crunchbase, Panaya has received $59 million in funding. Its last round, a Series E of $20 million, was disclosed in January.\\n\\n\\nFord and Tencent in talks to build messaging functions for Ford\\'s cars in China: Ford said it was in talks with Tencent, maker of the popular WeChat messaging app, to develop messaging functions for the manufacturer’s cars in China. David Huang, a senior engineer who heads Ford’s Asia Pacific connected-services unit, said, “People want to stay connected, stay informed and stay entertained all the time, even when they’re driving.” Drivers would sync their phone to their car’s software system and control WeChat functions, chosen by Tencent and certified by Ford as safe, through voice commands or limited use of buttons. Yale Zhang, managing director of the Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight, said connectivity was a deciding factor for Chinese customers buying a car. “Those kind of things are the fundamental things people will consider,” he added. Many Chinese use WeChat’s free voice messaging feature instead of phone calls, holding up their smartphones like walkie-talkies as they speak, tap and listen to replies. Rivals including Daimler and Nissan are also looking at ways to give drivers safe, hands-free access to mobile apps in China, home to the world’s largest number of smartphone users. WeChat is China’s most prevalent chatting app, with about half a billion active monthly users.\\n\\n\\nChina’s internet restrictions are hurting business, survey finds:\\xa0 Foreign businesspeople in China are increasingly frustrated by the growing obstacles to wide Internet access, including the onerous system of censorship known as the Great Firewall, according to survey results released this week by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. The survey was answered by 106 companies that are based in the European Union and have offices in China. Eighty-six percent of the respondents said their businesses had been negatively affected by the blocking of certain websites or tools. That was an increase from 71 percent in last year’s survey. The chamber also asked its members about the greater tightening of Internet access that occurred in China at the end of 2014 and this year. Eighty percent reported a worsening impact on business. Starting in late 2014, the Chinese government cut off access to Gmail from third-party apps, forcing people in China to rely on virtual private network, or V.P.N., software to get to Google’s email service. The regular Gmail site and other Google pages had been blocked consistently since last summer, but people in China had been able to use third-party apps to download Gmail to their devices until December. After blocking Gmail downloads through those apps, forcing more people to turn to VPN software, the government went on to aggressively attack V.P.N.’s. The chamber found that 13 percent of survey respondents had recently deferred investing more in research and development in China, or had been unwilling to set up those operations here, since restrictions grew at the beginning of the year.\\n\\n\\nRussian cybersecurity firm alleges the US embeds super-sophisticated spyware in Iran, Pakistan, Russia and elsewhere: The United States has found a way to permanently embed surveillance and sabotage tools in computers and networks it has targeted in Iran, Russia, Pakistan, China, Afghanistan and other countries closely watched by American intelligence agencies, according to a Russian cybersecurity firm. In a presentation of its findings at a conference in Mexico on Monday, Kaspersky Lab, the Russian firm, said that the implants had been placed by what it called the “Equation Group,” which appears to be a veiled reference to the National Security Agency and its military counterpart, United States Cyber Command. It linked the techniques to those used in Stuxnet, the computer worm that disabled about 1,000 centrifuges in Iran’s nuclear enrichment program. It was later revealed that Stuxnet was part of a program code-named Olympic Games and run jointly by Israel and the United States. Kaspersky’s report said that Olympic Games had similarities to a much broader effort to infect computers well beyond those in Iran. It detected particularly high infection rates in computers in Iran, Pakistan and Russia, three countries whose nuclear programs the United States routinely monitors. Some of the implants burrow so deep into the computer systems, Kaspersky said, that they infect the “firmware,” the embedded software that preps the computer’s hardware before the operating system starts. It is beyond the reach of existing antivirus products and most security controls, Kaspersky reported, making it virtually impossible to wipe out. In many cases, it also allows the American intelligence agencies to grab the encryption keys off a machine, unnoticed, and unlock scrambled contents. Moreover, many of the tools are designed to run on computers that are disconnected from the Internet, which was the case in the computers controlling Iran’s nuclear enrichment plants.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWall Street starts to get restless about Google\\'s \\'moonshots\\'; firm\\'s R&D costs stood at highest-ever 12% of revenue in 2014, but returns were sparse: Last month, after years of promotion, Google ended a test trial of its Internet-connected glasses, called Glass. While the device seemed to have promising commercial applications in hospitals or on factory floors, its first pass at the consumer world was unsuccessful. The very public failure of Glass points to a bigger question. After patiently abiding a steep increase in research and development spending on efforts that range from biology to space exploration, Wall Street is starting to wonder when — and if — Google’s science projects will pay off. “We want companies to continue to push the envelope, but there has to be some financial responsibility around that,” said Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie Securities. “We have no real insight into what’s going on.” So investors are left to guess. Two years ago, analysts estimated that Glass sales would be $3 billion to $11 billion by 2018. Google’s self-driving car project, which faces huge technological and regulatory hurdles, has been called a $200 billion opportunity by Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. “These are guesses at best,” he said. “Our price target is based on things that are tangible, but we say on top of that there are wild cards.” The wisdom of financing wild cards would not be under question if Google’s core advertising business — which accounts for about 90 percent of its revenue — were roaring. But its growth, while still up about 20 percent from a year ago, has slowed, and the company’s dominance in desktop search engines has been eroded as consumers spend more time on mobile phones whose tiny screens are a less lucrative ad space. Now, instead of pie-in-the-sky estimates for products that may never become reality, the focus is on more mundane issues like costs and profit margins. Research and development costs grew to about 12 percent of gross revenue last year, the highest share since the company went public in 2004. That includes the vast majority of engineers and technical expenses at the company.\\n\\n\\nReports that Snapdeal close to raising $400M at valuation of $4.5B - Alibaba apparently not in on the deal: Snapdeal.com, is in talks with new investors, including international hedge funds, to raise $400 million in a fresh round of funding, a person privy to the development told Techcircle.in. This round could see the estimated valuation of Snapdeal increase to $4.5 billion, more than doubling since October. Sources said the rumoured deal between Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and Snapdeal is not on. Snapdeal already counts eBay as a strategic investor in the company. In October last year, Japanese telecom and internet firm SoftBank Corp (which is the single largest shareholder of Alibaba) committed $627 million (Rs 3,846 crore) in Snapdeal. This is the third biggest fundraising round by an Indian e-commerce firm ever, after Flipkart’s record $1 billion funding round early in 2014 which was followed by another $700 million round later during the year. That round also included funding from other existing investors. Snapdeal has raised around $1 billion to date, the bulk of it in 2014 itself.\\n\\n\\nChina\\'s two largest taxi apps, backed by Alibaba and Tencent respectively, to merge; post-deal valuation of $6B: Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache, two of China\\'s leading taxi-hailing apps, said on Saturday they would merge to create one of the world\\'s largest smartphone-based transport services. The combined entity would be valued at roughly $6 billion, according to person familiar with the deal. The shareholding structure is unknown. The firms said the two companies, which have not announced a name for the combined entity, would operate independently under separate brands. Didi chief executive Wei Cheng and Kuaidi chief Dexter Chuanwei Lu would become co-chief executives and formally introduce the new business after the Lunar New Year, which begins on Feb. 19, the companies said.  Didi and Kuaidi, backed by Chinese Internet giants Tencent Holdings Ltd and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, respectively, have been locked in a bitter price war for the past year as each seeks to corner the massive Chinese market despite rumors of mounting losses. Didi was estimated to have a roughly 55 percent market share, with Kuaidi claiming nearly all of the rest in a December study by Analysis International.\\n\\n\\nApple Pay gets a vote-of-confidence from the US government:\\xa0Apple chief executive Tim Cook announced on Friday a major new merchant for the company\\'s mobile payment solution: the U.S. government. \"Starting in September, Apple Pay will be available for many transactions with the federal government, like for example when you pay for admission to your favorite national park,\" Cook said at a White House organized cybersecurity summit at Stanford University. The company is also working with the government to make procurement cards issued to government employees for expenses compatible with the system, he said. More than 2,000 banks have already signed on with Apple to bring the service to their customers, Cook said, and it is working with the financial industry to deploy the technology to help distribute state and federal benefit programs, including Social Security benefits.The full scope of Cook\\'s announcement was a bit unclear, but a White House fact sheet released in conjunction with the summit said Apple, Visa, MasterCard, Comerica Bank and U.S. Bank were committed to making Apple Pay \"available for users of federal payment cards, including DirectExpress and GSA SmartPay cards.\"  GSA SmartPay is the largest government payment program in the world, according to the General Services Administration — handling 87.4 million transactions worth $26.4 billion per year. That makes this a potentially big deal.\\n\\n\\nChinese smartphone users consume surprisingly little data - 200MB/month; only about a fourth of the global average: China has about 520 million active smartphone users right now. Unlike in most of Asia’s developing nations, China’s smartphone market is mature and close to its saturation point. Despite all this well-established growth, China’s smartphone users are still using surprisingly little data each month – in fact, they’re using just a quarter of the global average. New numbers from China’s tech ministry, MIIT, shows that mobile users in China now consume an average of 200MB of data each month (as spotted by Reuters). While that figure is going up, it’s still way below the global monthly average of 819MB. China’s mobile data usage has grown slowly from an average of 122.8 MB per month in mid-2013. 200MB is pretty small. It’s the equivalent of downloading or streaming 50 songs or two short TV shows.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXiaomi takes baby steps in the US - where Apple rules, and carrier-sales + phone subsidies blunt cost advantages; also nears manufacturing deal in Brazil: Xiaomi will begin selling headphones, smart wristbands and other accessories online in the United States in coming months, taking its first tentative step onto Apple Inc\\'s home turf without its signature Mi mobile devices. The company also said it is close to securing a manufacturing partner in Brazil, which will help it skirt punishing tariffs on imported electronics when it begins sales in Latin America\\'s largest economy in the first half of this year. Xiaomi, a five-year-old upstart whose name means \"Little Rice,\" came out of nowhere to become China\\'s fastest-selling mobile brand. It has been rapidly expanding its global footprint through direct, online sales. The company was valued at $45 billion in a December funding round that drew investors ranging from Singapore\\'s sovereign wealth fund to a private capital firm backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd co-founder Jack Ma. Its Mi devices, which scored with Chinese users because of their low cost and the company\\'s heavy reliance on user interaction and feedback, are now sold online across Asia, including most recently India. Brazil marks the company\\'s first foray with smartphones outside of its home continent. Global operations vice president Hugo Barra said Xiaomi intends to begin selling its phones there in the first half of this year. The company is in \"extremely advanced discussions\" with at least half a dozen manufacturing partners there, Barra, a former Google Inc executive, said without revealing names, which will help it side-step a roughly 60 percent tax on foreign electronics. The company is eschewing bigger-ticket items like phones and tablets for now partly because of the United States\\' carrier-sales and phone subsidy structure, which eliminates Xiaomi\\'s cost advantage. More generally, Bin and Barra talked about the time and effort needed to tailor its MIUI Android-based operating systems for individual markets and obtain certification, among other things. Xiaomi\\'s main intention for now is to engage American consumers and try and build a community there the same way it has in China and India - through fan events, interaction with users on social media such as a dedicated Facebook page, and gradually coming to know both local preferences and building its brand. For example, Barra told Reuters how Xiaomi might put its self-branded headphones in front of U.S. audiophiles and tweak the product depending on their detailed feedback.\\n\\n\\nPinterest launches App Pins, aimed at boosting app discovery on Apple\\'s app store (1.4M apps and counting):\\xa0There are more than 1.4 million mobile applications in Apple’s App Store, so unless you have a good idea of what you’re looking for, it can be tough to stumble upon novel, surprising items among Apple’s sprawling garden of apps. Pinterest, the popular social bookmarking start-up, thinks it has a fix for this. The company is unveiling a new product on Thursday that could make it easier for people to discover new smartphone apps without even having to go into Apple’s App Store. The product, called App Pins, aims to do the same thing for smartphone apps that Pinterest’s service has done for photos, recipes and many other types of websites. In short, the service is a type of digital corkboard that lets visitors save, or “pin,” items they like or places they want to go. Pinterest’s philosophy is that it can help nudge people into doing things — be it buying a coffee maker or trying a new recipe — by letting the site’s 70 million estimated regular visitors search for and save for later the things that interest them. Pinterest believes it is better positioned to help promote apps because of the nature of the service. People come to Pinterest, the company says, to find new things to do, see and buy. That is unlike Facebook, which has been used to connect with friends, or even Twitter, which is often about public discourse and news. In addition, more than 75 percent of Pinterest’s use comes from mobile users, a crowd more able and willing to download new apps. It is also a significant move for Apple, which has long surfaced popular smartphone apps via the “featured” section of its App Store. If an app is placed in Apple’s featured section, which is carefully curated by Apple employees, it is much more visible than the hundreds of thousands of other apps in the company’s gigantic repository. In the past, Apple has had some difficulty with providing adequate app search to its customers, and has made several moves to better surface apps. In 2012, Apple bought Chomp, an app search company, and it has also introduced a host of new features to the app store ace apps, including a menu that shows which apps are trending in popularity at the moment, and also gave users the ability to search by categories and sub-categories of apps.  Along with Pinterest’s App Pins initiative, Apple will introduce its own curated App Store account on Pinterest, featuring multiple boards on the service on Thursday; it will use its in-house team to promote apps that will vary by season, theme and even the choices of so-called “guest pinners.” Pinterest said it did not yet have any plans to make money directly from App Pins. However, if Pinterest aims to follow in the footsteps of other social networks, App Pins could be significant for Pinterest’s business.\\n\\n\\nContrasting routes to staying relevant: Texas Instruments (\\'small and spread out\\') and Cisco (\\'big and comprehensive\\'): Texas Instruments, a 63-year-old company that produced the first silicon transistor, ran into trouble several years ago selling digital chips for wireless products. The company refocused on cheaper and less sophisticated nondigital chips. Done well, these chips have exceptional profit margins, and Texas Instruments’ stock has gained 143 percent in the past five years. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 78 percent over the same period. The chips also turn out to be profitable at a time when seemingly everything is acquiring some kind of machine intelligence. Performance improvements that used to happen with better mechanical engineering now come from closer monitoring and computer analysis. Mr. Templeton foresaw Texas Instruments as targeting a lot of small manufacturers, the kinds of places with 50 employees turning out just a few products, that never came near his business before. The reason is that almost every part of the manufactured world, including things like outboard motors or novelty doorbells, is going to have to include machine intelligence to monitor its performance. He plans to sell it to small manufacturers through an online catalog of parts, with salespeople touching the larger accounts. “It’ll be difficult for you and your world to analyze,” he warned a room full of Wall Street bankers. “It’s literally hundreds of thousands of customers, very disaggregated.” On Wednesday, Cisco Systems reported second-quarter earnings well above what Wall Street expected. Revenue was $11.9 billion, versus a consensus estimate of $11.8 billion published in a survey by Thomson Reuters. Adjusted net income was $2.7 billion, or 53 cents a share, compared with an expected 51 cents a share. For John T. Chambers, Cisco’s chief, it seemed a vindication for several years of struggle. “I’m not sure people outside Cisco appreciate the magnitude of the changes we have made in the past years,” he said in an interview. Cisco, he said, had changed 30 percent of its leadership, moved 40 percent of its employees from traditional businesses like computer networking hardware, and into software, industry-specific applications, collaboration and cloud computing. Cisco laid off 6,000 people from its ranks of 74,000, but also hired 6,000 people for other jobs. All those changes were similar to what Texas Instruments had gone through: The old company was retooling for a world in which machine intelligence is everywhere. So far, however, Cisco’s “big and comprehensive” approach does not have the payoff of T.I.’s “small and spread out” style. These things have a way of swinging, of course, and the first rule for any incumbent facing change is the same: Find a way to survive that works for what you’ve got.\\n\\n\\nIndian startup action: Housing.com in talks to acquire PropEquity, a real estate data analytics firm:  Housing.com, is in talks to acquire Delhi-based P.E. Analytics Pvt Ltd, which owns a real estate data product PropEquity, sources close to the development told Techcircle.in. According to industry sources, Housing.com is believed to have offered around Rs 80 crore for the company. PropEquity recorded revenues of Rs 13.7 crore in 2014 and losses of Rs 70 lakh. The company has been in losses for the last three years as it had made investments in building a B2C product, according to sources. The deal will give Housing.com a ready revenue stream from B2B clients as the heavily funded company will come under increasing pressure to show revenues. PropEquity’s data and analytics enable clients – mainly real estate private equity investors, developers, and BFSI industry – to spot market trends, and generate macro/micro analytics. It claims of covering over 45,000 projects of 8,200 developers across over 40 cities in India and adding about 500 projects every month. Presently, the company has over 250 employees. On the other hand, Housing.com is a B2C product primarily with tools to sieve through mountains of data to develop indices and metrics that help consumer search for homes. PropEquity is majority owned by entities belonging to American hedge fund Och-Ziff Capital Management Group.\\n\\n\\nStruggling to expand beyond Japan, Taiwan and Thailand, Line attempts to become a messaging platform for businesses (as WeChat has already done): Messaging app company Line has released a new service that will allow brands, SMEs and other business users to tap into its platform communicate with customers and consumers. The Line@ app – which is available for iOS and Android — is essentially an enterprise-focused version of Line’s chat app, which has 170 million active users worldwide. Line@ plugs into the existing chat service and lets us users exchange message with regular Line users and post content to the social network-like ‘Timeline’, but it is designed for communicating with people who are not friends, for example clients, customers or fans. “The Line@ service will greatly expand the potential of Line, for example allowing stores and facilities, as well as brand, media, and online business operators to promote new information, communicate with clients and other business contacts, create service usage reservations, and more. Designs, artists, magazine models, and other freelance talent can also utilize the service to communicate with fans,” Line explained. The new service is free to use, but Line is charging users for a vanity ID ($24 for the first year, $12 thereafter) while free accounts are limited to sending 1,000 messages per month. Those wishing to go for more can pay $50 per month for 50,000 messages, messages beyond that bundle cost $0.01 each. Line is already open to brands and business via its ‘official’ (branded) account option, but it costs tens of thousands of dollars to create and use a branded account leaving many business users priced out. In countries like Japan, Thailand and Taiwan — where Line is the dominant chat app — small merchants and SMEs have long adopted the consumer version of the app for their business, but in dong so they mix personal and work contacts in the same place. That’s exactly the issue that Line@ is designed to cater to, and it allows users to have a personal and business profile on the service. WeChat, the dominant chat app in China that counts nearly 500 million active users, has already made its app friendly to business users. Enterprise accounts were opened to all businesses last September, and earlier in 2014 the service added a mobile store platform and released its payment service to all businesses — combined together, those three elements allow companies to run their business and communications via the service. Line has introduced payment too, and though it is dabbling in its own version of shopping, it is pushing an online-to-offline strategy that allows companies to interact with fans via its mobile messaging platform — giving them a dedicated point of access, beyond the expensive official accounts, is an important step. However, Line has struggled to dominate markets beyond Japan, Taiwan and Thailand. A lack of users in a country makes it harder to sell the need for Line@ to businesses and brands, so it remains to be seen how this new app will be adopted.\\n\\n\\nTwo gaming companies result: Zynga Q4 earnings miss: bookings $182M, stock down 10%; King Q4 earnings beat: bookings $586M, stock up 18%: The fickleness of the gaming industry was on full display in the earnings reports of \"FarmVille\" creator Zynga Inc and \"Candy Crush\" maker King Digital Entertainment Plc. Zynga\\'s shares fell 10 percent while King Digital\\'s soared 18 percent in extended trading on Thursday after the companies reported contrasting fortunes in a key industry metric. King\\'s total gross bookings, an indicator of future revenue, increased 8 percent to $586 million in the fourth quarter, about $45 million more than the average analyst forecast. Zynga reported bookings of $182.4 million, about $19 million less than expected, according to research firm StreetAccount. The company, whose market value hit more than $14 billion in 2012, lost most of its shine after failing to come up with new games to match the popularity of \"FarmVille\". It was also caught off guard by mobile-focused rivals such as Dublin-based King Digital and Supercell, the maker of \"Clash of Clans\" and is now valued at about $2.4 billion. King, which went public last March, has a market value of about $4.6 billion. That helped it to avoid the fate of Zynga and \"Angry Birds\" developer Rovio Corp, which is also struggling to grow. King Digital\\'s revenue and profit easily trumped market estimates as its newer games more than made up for the declining popularity of older titles. Zynga\\'s main launch, the multi-player word game \"Words with Friends\", failed to excite gamers and launches aimed at the Chinese market failed to live up to expectations. The company said it would close its Beijing office and lay off all 71 employees. Zynga\\'s forecast for bookings in the current quarter also fell far short of estimates, according to StreetAccount. Up to Thursday\\'s close of $14.74, King Digital\\'s shares had risen 10 percent in the past six months. Zynga\\'s shares had fallen 7 percent to $2.66.\\n\\n\\nGroupon Q4 revenue $926M, +20% Y/Y, stock flat: Groupon gave a forecast for first-quarter results that fell short of Wall Street\\'s expectations on Thursday, as the online commerce company confirmed that several parties have expressed interest in acquiring its South Korean subsidiary Ticket Monster. Those parties had opened discussions with Groupon about possibly buying the loss-making Asian e-commerce firm, which sells tickets online and is valued at about $1 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported last month. Groupon said it was too early to comment on the likelihood of such a deal, though it continues to explore alternatives for its various Asian businesses. Groupon bought Ticket Monster from rival LivingSocial Inc about a year ago for $260 million. On Thursday, Groupon, which once dominated the fast-growing online coupons arena, forecast revenue of $790 million to $840 million in the March quarter, up 13 percent from a year earlier on a foreign exchange-neutral basis. That lagged Groupon\\'s target for 15 percent growth on the same basis in 2015. It also fell short of an average analyst estimate of $856.14 million. Revenue was up 20 percent at $925.4 million during the three-month holiday period. Shares in the company slid 1 percent to $7.38 in after-hours trade.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n25,000:1 - that\\'s the ratio of data center machines to employees at Facebook, says FB\\'s VP Engineering: While most enterprises have a ratio in data centers of one person for every 250 to 500 computers, Facebook has 25,000 machines for every person, Mr. Parikh said. Facebook’s entire network, he said, is overseen by just one person at any given time. Given Facebook\\'s employee strength of ~10,000, this implies that its data centers could have ~250M machines; similar calculations would place Google at between 25M and 50M machines. \\n\\n\\nA curated introductions startup gains as a way to meet top tech talent in Silicon Valley\\'s red-hot job market: Given the current job market in Silicon Valley, one of the biggest challenges faced by startups and established companies alike is the difficulty in finding and recruiting the best engineers. If you’re a company that’s got a lot of mindshare, you might not have much trouble getting those hot applicants — or you can raise enough to buy smaller teams. But for those without years worth of networking under their belts, finding new engineers can be a real struggle that takes focus away from the task of actually building a product. Enter InterviewJet, which gives employers who sign up a weekly curated introduction to experienced engineers with in-demand skill sets — think Ruby on Rails, Python, and mobile developers. Once the introduction has been made, potential employers have 72 hours to lock down an interview with candidates. InterviewJet co-founder and CEO Joshua Holtzman says the startup has facilitated 1,000 interviews and signed up more than 450 employers to their network since rolling out as a beta in early 2014. With just ten employees, InterviewJet is currently signing up approximately half of the 40-50 companies that apply to join each week and vetting 10-12 new candidates to show off to its member companies. InterviewJet takes a flat fee for every hire it facilitates — $9,500 to be more precise, which Holtzman says often undercuts the finders fee usually paid to headhunters working for top firms. That rate might change in the future based on factors like candidate skill sets or when companies use the service to hire multiple engineers in one pass as an acquisition. That’s happened three times now, including an acqui-hire arranged last summer by Samsung that was facilitated entirely through the service. Since launching its beta version, InterviewJet went through the Talent Tech Labs incubator in New York, which is dedicated to bolstering startups in the talent acquisition space. Post-incubator, the startup has raised $750,000 in seed funding from Mitchell Martin, an IT and healthcare staffing company. Holtzman says that money will go to expanding InterviewJet’s sales and product teams, increasing staff on both by half.\\n\\n\\nFacebook Unveils Networking Switch to Take On Cisco, Juniper: Facebook Inc. unveiled a new networking-equipment system designed to displace products from companies like Cisco Systems Inc. and Juniper Networks Inc. with flexible hardware at the heart of large data centers. The system, nicknamed 6-pack, will let Facebook build networks by filling large racks with a smaller switch called Wedge, introduced in June. Using its own design helped Facebook, whose social-networking website has 1.4 billion users, reduce spending on infrastructure and upgrade its capabilities without depending on outside suppliers. The 6-pack is built to replace high-capacity spine switches that handle the bulk of traffic in data centers. Though it was originally marketed as a cheaper, top-of-rack switch, Wedge was designed to become a building block for systems to replace more expensive kinds of gear, said Najam Ahmad, Facebook’s vice president of infrastructure. The spine switch market was worth about $2.9 billion in 2014, smaller yet more profitable than the $3.1 billion top-of-rack switch market, according to Infonetics Research, a unit of IHS Inc. In the past, Menlo Park, California-based Facebook bought its spine switches from traditional networking-gear providers like Cisco and Juniper, Ahmad said, without specifying the company’s suppliers. \\n\\n\\nCompetitors react cautiously to Facebook\\'s moves: Kelly Kramer, Cisco’s chief financial officer, downplayed the risk to Cisco, and pointed to strong sales of its Nexus family of switches in its most recent quarter. She noted that Cisco was also a member of the Open Compute Project, to “better understand where our customers are going.” Juniper is more actively supporting the open approach. In December, it submitted a design for a new switch called the OCX1100 to the Open Compute Project. If accepted, any OCP member could build the machine or write software for it. Arista Networks Inc., a fast-growing supplier specializing in data center switches, is the most threatened by the open approach, given that it gets a high percentage of its sales from a few large cloud providers, according to Jason Noah Ader, an analyst at William Blair & Co.\\n\\n\\nCisco Q4 Earnings: revenue $11.94B, +7%, net income $2.4B, shares up 5.5% on earnings beat: Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) reported stronger-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit as demand for switching equipment and routers helped make up for weak spending by the company\\'s traditional telecom customers. Cisco, which saw its shares rise 5.6 percent in extended trading on Wednesday, has been trying to make a transition toward a new cycle of high-end switches and routers. \"\"We executed very well in a tough environment, and I\\'d say our strategy is playing out like we expected,\" Chief Financial Officer Kelly Kramer told Reuters. The switching business, which makes products that handle traffic at large internet data centers, brought in about 39 percent of Cisco\\'s total hardware revenue in 2014, while the router business accounted for about 21.2 percent. \"They are seeing very robust switching sales,\" Needham & Co analyst Alex Henderson told Reuters, adding that this was good news for others in the sector such as Infoblox Inc (BLOX.N), Gigamon Inc (GIMO.N) and F5 Networks Inc (FFIV.O). Revenue from Cisco\\'s hardware business rose 7.8 percent to $9.08 billion in the company\\'s second quarter ended Jan. 24. Revenue from services, which includes the company\\'s software and cloud offerings, rose 4.6 percent to $2.86 billion. Subscriptions generate more predictable recurring revenue than hardware sales. The services business is also less likely to suffer from sudden shifts in demand. \"They may have the worst in the rear view right now,\" said Wedbush Securities analyst Scott Thompson.\\n\\n\\nBaidu Q4 earnings: revenue $2.26B, +47.5%; shares down 9% on earnings miss; Baidu, owner of China\\'s dominant search engine, reported a lower-than-expected 47.5 percent rise in quarterly revenue as more users switched from PCs to mobile devices, which have less space for more lucrative forms of advertising. Shares of the U.S.-listed company fell 7.8 percent to $198 in extended trading on Wednesday. Baidu, sometimes referred to as China\\'s Google, reported revenue of 14.05 billion yuan, or $2.26 billion, for the fourth quarter, falling short of the average analyst estimate of 14.12 billion yuan, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Mobile revenue represented 42 percent of total revenue, up from 36 percent in the third quarter, Baidu said. \"In December, for the first time search revenue from mobile surpassed PC,\" Chief Executive Robin Li said in a statement. Baidu forecast revenue of 12.65 billion-13.07 billion yuan ($2.04 billion-$2.12 billion) for the current quarter. Analysts on average expected revenue of 13.62 billion yuan. The forecast reflects the combined impact of the late timing of Chinese New Year and increased contribution from mobile as a percentage of overall revenue, the company said. Baidu is facing increased competition on smartphones as companies such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) and Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) invest in apps and content to keep users engaged. Net income attributable to Baidu jumped 16 percent to 3.23 billion yuan, or $520.4 million, for the fourth quarter.\\n\\n\\nBangalore lending platform Capital Float, SME lender to Flipkart, Snapdeal sellers, gets $13M in funding: Bangalore-headquartered Zen Lefin Pvt Ltd, the company behind Capital Float, an online platform that provides working capital finance to SMEs (small and medium enterprises) in India, has secured $13 million (Rs 81 crore) in Series A funding from Sequoia Capital with participation of existing investors SAIF Partners and Aspada, it said on Wednesday. The funds will be used for expanding into more cities, improve its tech platform and launch new products. Capital Float works with underserved small businesses via a technology-led loan origination and credit underwriting platform. It provides short-term loans to SMEs that can be used to purchase inventory, service new orders or optimise cash cycles. Borrowers can apply online, select desired repayment terms and receive funds in their bank accounts in seven days. The firm caters to SMEs across a variety of sectors, including manufacturing, services and e-commerce. “We’ve focused on building the platform to deliver flexible and convenient access to finance that can scale with their business (borrowers). By leveraging alternative data in our underwriting model, we are increasingly able to not only make faster decisions but also lend to emerging business models,” said Hinduja and Rishyasringa in a joint statement. To date, the platform claims of having lent nearly Rs 40 crore to SMEs across more than 10 cities in India. Most of the loan applications come from vendors on marketplaces such as Snapdeal, Flipkart, Amazon, PayTM and Myntra.\\n\\n\\nAtlas, Facebook\\'s ad tech network is becoming a platform, as agency giants plug in: Facebook is opening its ad tech to more agencies and brands after making a round of new deals with big holding companies and advertising software firms. Publicis and its tech arm, VivaKi, are now plugged into Facebook\\'s Atlas ad network, which launched in the fall to compete with Google\\'s DoubleClick and to help brands and agencies deliver ads across the Internet, desktop computers and mobile devices. Also, ad tech companies Mediaocean and Merkle are now tapped into the system.These new Atlas partners reveal how Facebook is approaching the future of its ad business, said Erik Johnson, head of Atlas. The social site is bringing on strategic advisors and ad tech experts to help implement its vision for a digital advertising ecosystem. \"We have three holding companies on board, and the remaining three of the big six we\\'re optimistic about getting,\" Johnson said. Omnicom was a launch partner when Facebook unveiled Atlas in the fall. Facebook then explained it would shift from cookie-based digital measurements, which track users by the software placed on websites, to \"people-based\" metrics. Since the launch, Facebook has brought Havas and Publicis into the fold. The Mediaocean deal means that company\\'s brand clients will be able to use Atlas and its unique measurements. \"We\\'re now reporting at an audience level. Most other third-party ad servers all are cookie based,\" said Bill Wise, CEO of Mediaocean. \"Instead of just reporting on unique users or unique devices, we\\'re reporting on unique people.\" Facebook and its partners say this people-based measurement means more efficient ad spending, because it removes some uncertainty when delivering ads based on user or device identifications that may or may not know exactly who is on the other end. Facebook\\'s 1.4 billion logged-in user base gives it a lot of intelligence about who views an ad on any device.\\n\\n\\nAmazon Prime delivery was riddled with problems this holiday season, says survey - Amazon is n\\'t so sure: Amazon.com Inc packages ordered by its Prime members regularly arrived late during the holidays, a Reuters/Ipsos survey shows, reflecting the strain on the logistics network that transformed the company into an e-commerce powerhouse. Customer satisfaction with Prime is extremely high - 96 percent are happy with its two-day shipping service, the survey revealed. But the results raise questions for Amazon as it expands and takes greater control of its shipping system. Amazon said the survey was flawed and disputed its findings. Amazon said U.S. Prime memberships increased 50 percent last year. Analysts reckon that the largest U.S. online retailer now promises standard two-day shipping to what amounts to nearly one-third of U.S. households. In the Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted last month, 10 percent of about 1,700 Amazon shoppers who chose the two-day shipping option said packages ordered between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31 did not arrive on the expected day. Amazon has increasingly tapped local and regional package delivery companies to cut costs and improve speeds. None of the firms Amazon lists as delivery partners on its website would comment for this article. This is the first time Reuters has conducted this survey, so it is unclear how Amazon fared in the past. In addition, Reuters did not compare delays at Amazon with other retailers. The Reuters/Ipsos survey had a credibility interval of plus or minus 1.4 percentage points. Amazon\\'s net shipping costs as a percentage of revenue have remained relatively constant over the last several years, at about 4.7 percent. However, Amazon and other shippers continue to worry about rising costs. Early this month, United Parcel Service Inc said it would begin applying surcharges to deliver packages to homes. UPS, which reported that its earnings were hit by holiday shipping expenses, said its own cost to deliver a package to a residence are three times more than to a business. Guaranteed two-day shipping on items as low as a few dollars - such as $5.17 for a set of measuring spoons - costs Amazon big. Prime is also the vehicle for Amazon\\'s other pricey ventures, including film and television production, same-day shipping and even one-hour delivery in New York.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

The new “Sell” feature, which is now starting to roll out globally to more groups, will allow members to create a post where you can add a description of the item for sale, set a price and set a pick-up or delivery location. The social network today already hosts tens of millions of groups based around a variety of interests, and “For Sale” groups are one of the most popular categories. In these groups, members use Facebook as an alternative to something like Craigslist for local selling, or as an alternative to eBay for selling collectibles or other items of broad interest, like books or electronics. Currently, members in these “For Sale” groups generally post photos and text descriptions of their items, but the addition of the “Sell” feature will make filling out the necessary information a bit more structured than before. \\n\\n\\nICICI Bank has launched a digital wallet that will allow its users to instantly send money to any e-mail id, mobile number, or Facebook friend, besides a bank account. Called ‘Pockets’, the wallet also enables users to pay bills, recharge mobiles numbers, book movie tickets, order food, send physical and e-gifts, as well as split and share expenses with friends. How it works? After downloading the wallet from Google Play store, users will need to tap on ‘create an account’, and enter basic details like their name, mobile number, gender, email id, date of birth and address. Post that, users will receive a one time password (OTP) on their mobile numbers to create a user id and password, after which they can get started by loading funds into ‘Pockets’ using any bank’s net banking or debit card details. In comparison, existing ICICI bank savings account customers can register for the e-wallet by simply using their internet banking login credentials and authenticating the OTP sent to their registered mobile number. How is it different? The e- wallet uses a virtual VISA card with which users can shop online on any website or mobile application in India. Customers can also request for a physical card to use it at any retail outlet. Users can set up ‘favourites’ from their contacts, thereby allowing them to make payments quickly. From the app, users can also request for a savings account to be added to the e-wallet, and an ICICI bank official will visit them to open the savings account using ‘Tab Banking’. The users can view their account statement and track expenses by clubbing them under a hashtag. Off late, ICICI bank has been launching a number of technology-led services that include the launch of the Windows version of iMobile; fully automated 24X7 ‘Touch Banking’ branches; Tab Banking; and contactless debit and credit cards. Last month, the bank had launched ‘icicibankpay’, which it claims is India’s first service that allows users to send money over micro-blogging site Twitter.\\n\\n\\nTop tech firms, already sitting on mountains of cash, are borrowing record amounts. Why? Because they can. Microsoft, one of a handful of U.S. companies with top AAA credit ratings, sold a record $10.8 billion of bonds Monday. The 40-year portion of the offering pays an annual interest rate of 4 percent. The Redmond, Washington-based company had $6.4 billion of cash and cash-like securities on its books as of year end. And Apple, which had a whopping $19.5 billion of cash stashed away at the end of December, is back in the bond market for the second time this month. The iPhone creator raised $6.5 billion in an offering last week and is now heading to Switzerland to sell at least 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.1 billion) in its debut offering in that nation.  The party in bonds seems like a win-win for everyone -- for now, at least. Buyers of Microsoft’s $10.8 billion bond sale Monday reaped a $32.7 million reward just in the first few hours after the sale as the debt’s market value climbed. So, what’s the problem? Well, it’s always a little scary when everyone piles into a trade that already seemed crowded. Yields on U.S. investment-grade corporate bonds have fallen to 3.1 percent, compared with 4.7 percent on average over the past decade, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Buying top-rated bonds isn’t a guaranteed payday either. These notes are more sensitive to moves in benchmark government yields, a potential liability as the Federal Reserve debates raising interest rates this year. Why should having billions of dollars in cash stop you from borrowing more? That appears to be the logic at top-rated companies like Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. They’re selling bonds at an accelerating clip, locking in cheap interest rates for as long as 40 years. “The cost of capital that you’re paying is so obscenely low that there’s no reason not to” borrow, said Jody Lurie, a corporate credit analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia. Corporate treasurers are wondering: “When is this wonderful market situation for these higher-rated credits going to end?”\\n\\n\\nFlush with cash, Apple is expected to expand its share buyback programs, CEO asserts that Apple isn’t a cash hoarder. That’s the message Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook delivered to investors on Tuesday at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference in San Francisco. “By and large, my view is for cash that we don’t need -- with some level of buffer -- we want to give back,” Cook said. “It may come across that we are, but we’re not hoarders.” The Cupertino, California-based company is reviewing its capital-return program and will announce changes in April, he said. Apple has completed $103 billion of its $130 billion dividend and stock-repurchase plan, which has been increased several times before. “We started with dividends and buybacks and we’ve tweaked that model every year,” Cook said. “We’ve been sort of on a cadence of once a year we look at it very deeply, very thoughtfully, and we change the program accordingly.” The iPhone maker ended December with $178 billion in cash and marketable securities, according to a company statement on Jan. 27. Of that, $157.8 billion was held by foreign subsidiaries, where the money is shielded from U.S. taxes unless it’s repatriated. The company has raised the equivalent of more than $40 billion in debt in less than two years to help finance dividends and buybacks, including the sale of $6.5 billion in bonds last week and 1.25 billion Swiss francs ($1.35 billion) of bonds in that currency this week. Apple is boosting its borrowing as it seeks to return more capital to investors without incurring U.S. taxes on foreign profits. The company’s cash hoard grew by about $23 billion in the December quarter from the previous period as the introduction of more expensive, larger-screened iPhones helped boost Apple’s profit to a record. China in particular was a bright spot, with sales rising 70 percent. Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn has been pressuring Apple to increase its buybacks, arguing that the stock is undervalued and should be trading at a price that would give the company a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion. The shares rose 1.9 percent to $122.02 on Tuesday in New York trading, boosting the company’s market value to more than $710 billion. “In April, we believe Apple is set to announce a new 3-year total capital return program in the $150 billion to $200 billion range when it refreshes its goals this spring,” Ben Reitzes, an analyst at Barclays Plc, wrote in a note to investors. “We believe management will want to give itself some flexibility to raise this forecast later down the road (its usual practice) and also have some flexibility to re-evaluate the targets should it get more certainty on tax policies.”\\n\\n\\nSeveral of the best-funded startups in Singapore are struggling; rocket startup Lazada is the one unicorn on the list:  1. Lazada, US$686 million: The fashion ecommerce retailer is one of Rocket Internet’s greatest successes so far, and is the only unicorn on this list with a valuation of US$1.25 billion. Thanks to its recent shift to a marketplace model for third-party merchants, Lazada’s sales – or gross merchandise volume (GMV) – doubled in the second half of 2014 as compared to the former half, bringing its total GMV for that year to roughly US$274.2 million. 2. Zalora, US$238 million: The other Rocket Internet-backed startup on the list, Zalora’s last-seen numbers aren’t exactly rosy. According to leaked documents, it had a net negative income of US$91 million in 2012, expecting to reach profitability by 2015.  3. iCarsClub, US$70.5 million: A peer-to-peer car rental platform is a great idea in Singapore, given the high costs of car ownership here. Nailing the execution, however, is a whole different ballgame, and iCarsClub has received some negative publicity in 2014 regarding just that. Still, having a war chest at its disposal will certainly help if it is directed in the right direction. iCarsClub and its Beijing-based spinoff PPzuche now have over 120,000 private cars available in their databases. 4. PropertyGuru, US$53 million: Online property classifieds are a hotly-contested industry in Southeast Asia, but somehow PropertyGuru have managed to stay ahead of the pack. In Singapore, 99.co is the latest challenger. CEO Steve Melhuish had revealed a couple of years ago that the company might go public, but nothing has happened since then. 5. Reebonz, US$40 million, 6. Bubbly, US$39 million, 7. MyRepublic, US$37.5 million, 8. Migme, US$34.6 million , 9. Wego, US$34.5 million, 10. Viki, US$24.3 million \\n\\n\\n[Indian startup action] StoreKing, an e-com enabler for offline stores in small towns gets funding from Mangrove Capital: Mangrove Capital Partners, a Luxembourg-based venture capital firm which has backed Skype and Nimbuzz, has invested in LocalCube Commerce Pvt Ltd, an e-com enabler for offline stores in small towns under the brand StoreKing, as per its website. Although the investment amount stands undisclosed, the VC firm typically puts in $5-10 million in a company initially. It is learnt that the transaction was completed a few weeks ago. We have contacted Sridhar Gundaiah, founder of LocalCube, and will update the post as and when we hear from him. StoreKing is essentially an enabler for offline stores to expand their reach. It installs digital kiosks with screens at stores in small towns providing a self-service shopping experience to consumers. It claims it is present in over 600 stores in 22 districts of Karnataka and covers over 190 towns in the state According to its site, its kiosk-enabled stores sees over 50,000 walk-ins everyday and over 200,000 people have registered on its platform and it has sold over 30,000 SKUs to date. The Bangalore-based startup was founded in 2011 by Gundaiah, a computer science engineer who was previously with online travel agency Via.com. He had also founded a location based startup Yulop and in the past worked at Yellow Tag and EDS. Meanwhile, Mangrove Capital’s partner Michael Jackson told The Economic Times that the VC firm has earmarked a corpus of $200-250 million to invest in India’s e-commerce, internet and telecom startups. It has an investment horizon of 5-10 years.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlast-from-the-past: A famous old post on Amazon\\'s move to a Service Oriented Architecture:\\xa0One day Jeff Bezos issued a mandate. He’s doing that all the time, of course, and people scramble like ants being pounded with a rubber mallet whenever it happens. But on one occasion — back around 2002 I think, plus or minus a year — he issued a mandate that was so out there, so huge and eye-bulgingly ponderous, that it made all of his other mandates look like unsolicited peer bonuses. His Big Mandate went something along these lines: 1) All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces. 2) Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces. 3) There will be no other form of interprocess communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team’s data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network. 4) It doesn’t matter what technology they use. HTTP, Corba, Pubsub, custom protocols — doesn’t matter. Bezos doesn’t care. 5) All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions. 6) Anyone who doesn’t do this will be fired. 7) Thank you; have a nice day! Ha, ha! You 150-odd ex-Amazon folks here will of course realize immediately that #7 was a little joke I threw in, because Bezos most definitely does not give a shit about your day. Over the next couple of years, Amazon transformed internally into a service-oriented architecture. They learned a tremendous amount while effecting this transformation. There was lots of existing documentation and lore about SOAs, but at Amazon’s vast scale it was about as useful as telling Indiana Jones to look both ways before crossing the street. Amazon’s dev staff made a lot of discoveries along the way. A teeny tiny sampling of these discoveries included: – pager escalation gets way harder, because a ticket might bounce through 20 service calls before the real owner is identified. If each bounce goes through a team with a 15-minute response time, it can be hours before the right team finally finds out, unless you build a lot of scaffolding and metrics and reporting. – every single one of your peer teams suddenly becomes a potential DOS attacker. Nobody can make any real forward progress until very serious quotas and throttling are put in place in every single service. – monitoring and QA are the same thing. You’d never think so until you try doing a big SOA. But when your service says “oh yes, I’m fine”, it may well be the case that the only thing still functioning in the server is the little component that knows how to say “I’m fine, roger roger, over and out” in a cheery droid voice. In order to tell whether the service is actually responding, you have to make individual calls. The problem continues recursively until your monitoring is doing comprehensive semantics checking of your entire range of services and data, at which point it’s indistinguishable from automated QA. So they’re a continuum. – if you have hundreds of services, and your code MUST communicate with other groups’ code via these services, then you won’t be able to find any of them without a service-discovery mechanism. And you can’t have that without a service registration mechanism, which itself is another service. So Amazon has a universal service registry where you can find out reflectively (programmatically) about every service, what its APIs are, and also whether it is currently up, and where. – debugging problems with someone else’s code gets a LOT harder, and is basically impossible unless there is a universal standard way to run every service in a debuggable sandbox. That’s just a very small sample. There are dozens, maybe hundreds of individual learnings like these that Amazon had to discover organically. There were a lot of wacky ones around externalizing services, but not as many as you might think. Organizing into services taught teams not to trust each other in most of the same ways they’re not supposed to trust external developers.\\n\\n\\nWinner-takes-all: Apple Grabs 93% of the Handset Industry’s Profit; Apple + Samsung > 100% of Industry Profits Report Says: Apple’s record-breaking holiday quarter, which brought in $18 billion in earnings, allowed the company to capture 93 percent of the profit in the handset industry, according to a new report from Canaccord Genuity, an investment firm. Samsung took the rest, but its share is shrinking, the report said. Canaccord Genuity’s report on industry profits a year ago estimated that Apple took 87.4 percent of phone earnings in the fourth quarter of 2013, while Samsung took in 32.2 percent of industry profits. (The numbers add up to more than 100 percent because Apple and Samsung combined made more money than other competitors lost.) The report acknowledges that it may be overstating Apple’s profit because it does not include estimates for some Chinese vendors like Xiaomi, which is one of the biggest smartphone makers in China, the largest smartphone market in the world. The report notes that no estimate could be drawn because Xiaomi, a private company, does not disclose its profit numbers. However, Xiaomi’s profit model does not primarily rely on smartphone sales. The company sells its phones for nearly the same amount it costs to buy and assemble the materials. To make money, Xiaomi focuses on selling apps, games, and special Android operating system themes and Internet services. The upshot of the report is that Samsung is losing ground in its fight with Apple for smartphone dominance. Samsung still sells more cellphones than any other company. But its profit is eroding because Apple is eating into its sales of high-end smartphones, a trend that is likely to continue after the enormous success of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Both iPhones, which include bigger screens, gave Apple a huge boost in China, an important market for Samsung.\\n\\n\\nThe package delivery start-up space is getting increasingly crowded in the US: Sidecar, a Ride-Hailing Start-Up, Pushes Into Package Delivery Start-ups like Uber and Lyft are making it acceptable to carpool with total strangers. In the future, you may start carpooling with their lunch. That is exactly what Sidecar, a ride-hailing start-up in competition with the likes of Uber and Lyft, aims to make happen. The company announced on Monday it plans to use its fleet of cars to introduce a package delivery service, delivering items like food and groceries for partner companies. That service will be powered by Sidecar drivers who are also picking up and dropping off passengers, a move the company says cuts pricing and delivery times dramatically. The new service, which is now available in all of the American cities in which Sidecar operates, is essentially an open call to restaurants, grocers and stores which do not otherwise offer a delivery service. Sidecar, which is based in San Francisco, will face numerous competitors. GrubHub, the big online food-ordering service, recently acquired DiningIn and Restaurants on the Run, two companies that will allow GrubHub to start offering delivery for the restaurants it serves. Postmates, another start-up, owns a fleet of messengers who order and pick up food from thousands of restaurants. Sidecar will rub up against Uber, too, in its ultimate ambitions of becoming a way to delivery anything — from groceries to gourmet food — anytime, anywhere to anyone. And to some degree, Sidecar’s move into deliver will also pit it against a couple of the tech titans, Amazon and Google, which have both dabbled in same-day delivery projects.\\n\\n\\nPatent story #1 of the day: Qualcomm Inc. was fined $975 million by Chinese antitrust regulators, who set new terms for smartphone makers to license the chipmaker’s technology, ending an inquiry that threatened the U.S. company’s growth in the biggest mobile market. China’s National Development and Reform Commission issued a decision that Qualcomm violated its anti-monopoly law, the San Diego-based company said Monday in a statement. Qualcomm won’t challenge the decision, which includes a fine of 6.088 billion yuan ($975 million) and imposes conditions on royalties charged on phones sold in China. The accord puts to rest an investigation that lasted more than a year and hurt Qualcomm’s ability to collect licensing revenue in China, where some handset makers have delayed royalty payments or paid less than they owe. Qualcomm, whose chips run most of the world’s phones that can access the Internet, gets the majority of its profit from patent-licensing fees related to its ownership of technology fundamental to cellular-phone systems. “It’s a net positive when it’s all shook out,” said Mike Walkley, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, who recommends buying Qualcomm stock. “It makes more sense if China wants to protect the Chinese consumer.” Qualcomm shares rose 3.1 percent in extended trading following the announcement. They gained 1.2 percent to $67.11 at the close in New York. The stock was little changed last year as the company grappled with the impact of the investigation on its business. As a concession to Chinese authorities, Qualcomm will offer licenses to 3G and 4G essential patents and will no longer require the bundling of those rights with other patents in its portfolio, the company said. For handsets sold in China, Qualcomm will charge a licensing rate that’s similar to the royalty rates it charges elsewhere in the world, countering concerns that it would be forced to offer a discount to settle the investigation. While the percentage being charged is similar, the value of the handsets -- used as the basis for the calculation -- will be assessed at 65 percent of the device’s total price for phones sold in China, Qualcomm said. “We end up better-positioned as a company in China as a result,” Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf said in a telephone interview. “It removes the uncertainty.” The company had $31.6 billion of cash and marketable securities at the end of its most recent quarter. While chip sales provided 74 percent of revenue in that period, licensing fees contributed 58 percent of pretax profit. The company has collected more than $30 billion in royalties in the past five years. The chipmaker said it now projects revenue for the year that ends in September will be $26.3 billion to $28 billion, compared with a Jan. 28 forecast that revenue would be as low as $26 billion. Annual profit excluding certain costs will be $4.85 to $5.05 a share, Qualcomm said, up from an earlier estimate of $4.75 to $5.05\\n\\n\\nPatent story #2 of the day: Microsoft and Samsung have settled a contract dispute over patent royalties, though terms of the settlement are confidential, Microsoft said in a statement on Monday. Microsoft sued Samsung last year in a federal court in New York, accusing Samsung of breaching a collaboration agreement by initially refusing to make royalty payments after the U.S. company announced its intention to acquire Nokia\\'s handset business in September 2013. The lawsuit claimed Samsung still owed $6.9 million in interest on more than $1 billion in patent royalties it delayed paying. Samsung has countered that the Nokia acquisition violated its 2011 collaboration deal with Microsoft. In 2011 a technology analyst at Citigroup estimated that Microsoft was getting $5 per Android handset sold by phone maker HTC under a patent agreement, and that Microsoft was looking for up to $12.50 per phone from other handset makers it had yet to come to an agreement with. Microsoft has never confirmed those figures, but neither has it said publicly that the estimates were out of line. To apply the $5 price to Samsung, the Korean company could be paying Microsoft about $1.6 billion per year, based on Samsung\\'s sales of 318 million smartphones in 2014, according to IDC shipment numbers. Samsung said it had agreed in 2011 to pay Microsoft royalties in exchange for a patent license covering phones that ran Google Inc\\'s Android operating system. Samsung also agreed to develop Windows phones and share confidential business information with Microsoft, according to court filings. Once Microsoft acquired Nokia, it became a direct hardware competitor with Samsung, the filings said, and Samsung refused to share some sensitive information because of antitrust concerns.\\n\\n\\nPatent story #3 of the day: IBM filed a lawsuit against Priceline on Monday, accusing it of infringing four IBM patents in running its travel and dining websites. International Business Machines Corp asked the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware to bar Priceline from using the patents, to award IBM royalties and to order Priceline to pay IBM\\'s costs and attorney\\'s fees. IBM also said that the infringement was willful, and asked for all damages to be trebled. IBM said it had approached Priceline about the alleged infringement. \"Despite IBM’s repeated demands, Priceline refuses to negotiate a license. This lawsuit seeks to stop Priceline from continuing to use IBM’s intellectual property without authorization,\" IBM said in its complaint. Two of the IBM patents are from the late 1990s, one which tracks prior conversations with a user and another which speeds Internet transmissions. The third patent is from 2006 and is a method of showing Internet advertising; a fourth from 2009 improves on a single sign-on. Priceline also used the patented technology on its websites kayak.com and opentable.com, IBM alleged.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba, Xiaomi have reason to worry: Apple has disrupted the Chinese smartphone market: When Apple reported a record-shattering profit of $18 billion last month, the company said its growth came largely from sales in greater China. This week, some research firms gave a clearer picture of just how big Apple has become in China. Both Kantar Worldpanel and Canalys, firms that track global smartphone sales, said Apple’s iOS mobile operating system gained market share in China at the expense of Google’s Android. Chris Jones, an analyst for Canalys, said that in the fourth quarter of last year, iOS was in 12.3 percent of the smartphones sold in China, a sharp increase from 5 percent in the previous quarter. Android was in 86.3 percent of smartphones in the fourth quarter, compared with 93.7 percent in the third quarter, according to Mr. Jones. Canalys estimates that Apple is now the top smartphone vendor in China. But Mr. Jones said Canalys would explain how it reached this conclusion only to clients, not with the news media or competitors. Kantar Worldpanel found slightly different results. It focused its research on so-called urban China — a portion of mainland China where smartphones are more commonplace. Kantar also found that Apple’s iOS gained at the expense of Android. But the firm found that Apple was the No. 2 vendor in the region, with about 21.5 percent of the market, behind the Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi (29.2 percent) and ahead of Huawei and Samsung (about 12 percent each). Whether Apple is No. 1 or No. 2, its growth in China has been remarkable. Just last October, the company was the No. 6 smartphone maker in China, behind Huawei, Lenovo, Samsung, Xiaomi and Yulong, according to Canalys. Kantar Worldpanel also noted that about a quarter of the Chinese consumers who bought iPhones in the last three months were buying smartphones for the first time. Carolina Milanesi, a Kantar analyst, said Apple’s introduction of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which both have larger screens than previous iPhones, clearly drove the growth. “The success that Apple is seeing is certainly coming from the larger screen,” she said. She added that sales there of the larger iPhone 6 Plus surpassed sales of the iPhone 6 in December. Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said recently that it was only a matter of time until the majority of the company’s sales would come from China. The company plans to open 25 retail stores in greater China over the next two years, adding to the 15 stores it now operates in the area.\\n\\n\\n..Against that backdrop, Alibaba will buy a minority stake in little-known domestic smartphone maker Meizu Technology Co for $590 million, as the e-commerce giant extends its hardware growth strategy into mobile devices. Alibaba, now worth $213 billion by market value, didn\\'t disclose how big its holding will be in a privately owned handset maker that is a distant rival to much bigger smartphone firms like Xiaomi Inc [XTC.UL]. Based in Zhuhai, Guangdong, Meizu employs more than 1,000 people, according to its website. The deal will help Alibaba push its mobile operating system within China through Meizu\\'s handsets, while giving Meizu access to Alibaba\\'s e-commerce sales channels and other resources, the companies said in a joint statement. Alibaba has in the past concentrated on software and services, including its core e-commerce business. Now, in a move reminiscent of U.S. rival Amazon.com Inc\\'s own foray into smartphones with the Fire Phone, the Meizu investment builds on Alibaba\\'s more recent efforts to develop in hardware, like internet TV via set-top boxes. \"The investment in Meizu represents...an important step in our overall mobile strategy as we strive to bring users a wider array of mobile offerings and experiences,\" said Wang Jian, Alibaba\\'s chief technology officer, in Monday\\'s statement. China is the world\\'s largest smartphone market, with 557 million people accessing the internet via mobile devices, according to government data. But smartphone sales are flagging. Shipments in China were 389 million phones in 2014, down from 423 million the previous year, according to China\\'s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Meizu also doesn\\'t feature among China\\'s top smartphone brands. The top four in the fourth quarter of 2014 were Apple Inc, Xiaomi, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], according to data research firm Canalys.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe move is seen as Alibaba\\'s effort to kickstart its struggling mobile phone division:\\xa0Alibaba is stumping up more than half a billion dollars to kick its lacklustre mobile phone business into gear. The NYSE-listed e-commerce giant today announced a $590 million investment in Chinese phone-maker Meizu. The deal grants Alibaba an undisclosed “minority” share in the Guangdong-based company, which sold 1.5 million of its Android-based smartphones in January, but it is particularly notable for the strategic alliance between the two. Meizu, which operates a Xiaomi-like online sales model but is yet to break into China’s top five smartphone companies based on sales, will integrate its hardware with Alibaba’s struggling operating system. Aliyun, which is based around Android, is used for smartphones and smart TV sets. The move is an interesting one when you consider that Xiaomi, the smartphone success story of 2014, is rapidly moving into e-commerce after starting out in mobile hardware and software.\\n\\n\\nIndia\\'s efforts to attract electronics manufacturing are finally gaining some traction: General Electric Co. and Nidec Corp. are among companies looking to take advantage of a subsidy India is offering for electronics manufacturing amid Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s push to boost economic growth. The government has received at least 60 applications, with about half of them approved, for a subsidy of as much as 25 percent on capital investment, Ajay Kumar, joint secretary in the Department of Electronics & Information Technology, said in an interview in New Delhi. More than 40 submissions were made after Modi took office in May, he said. “The subsidy is a very good investment scheme that existed before Modi, but it wasn’t marketed very well,” Sunil Kumar, compliance officer at Nidec’s Indian unit, said by phone. “The government machinery is functioning better than before.” India introduced incentives in July 2012 for new projects and for expansion in electronics manufacturing in industries such as telecommunications, automobiles, medical and semiconductors. It started accepting applications for subsidies from August 2013, said Kumar at the Department of Electronics. “Suddenly with the emphasis on Digital India, electronics makers know there’ll be more demand for their products,” said Kumar. “Now, practically on a weekly basis applications come in.” Jabil Circuit Inc., the maker of electronics for Apple Inc. that got approval for its investment proposal in June, plans to double its revenue from a factory in the western city of Pune making products including television set-top boxes, Sunil Naik, operations manager at the India unit, said by phone. The St. Petersburg, Florida-based company, which plans to invest as much as $20 million, has already spent $6 million.\\n\\n\\nRecent product updates from Facebook showcase the firm\\'s sophistication in location targeting and audience targeting: Local Awareness Ads: Overview: Businesses now have the option of targeting their Facebook ads to individuals located near one of their brick-and-mortar stores. Details: Driving foot traffic that leads to sales is now a reality via Facebook. Advertisers can set a radius as small as a mile, and the Facebook ads will show up on the phones or web browsers of anyone who lives or was recently within that distance of a store. Businesses can even include directions in their ad, via a button that launches a map app on a consumer’s phone. Retailer Opportunities: Instead of broadly targeting your ads to an entire city, you can now reach people within a mile of your store. What You Should Know: This new geotargeting feature is really only beneficial to those online retailers that also have a brick-and-mortar presence. Also, these ads aren’t served in real-time, meaning that someone walking past your business won’t immediately see your store’s ad. Local awareness ads are available only for US business owners. Facebook Combines Atlas, Audience Network and LiveRail: Overview: The past two years of Facebook launches and acquisitions have now come together to show ads across the internet and track purchases they inspire both online and offline. Details: In February 2013, Facebook acquired Microsoft’s Atlas, a suite of tools for online ad measurement. Facebook is using Atlas as part of its push to measure across devices and platforms, and to leverage display targeting capabilities. In July 2014, Facebook acquired LiveRail, a video platform. Meanwhile, Facebook had built and launched Audience Network, a mobile ad network that lets advertisers easily extend their Facebook ad campaigns to appear in other mobile apps. The combo of Atlas, LiveRail and Audience Network now gives Facebook the connectivity to tie each of these pieces together. Retailer Opportunities: Advertisers on Atlas can buy ads on Facebook or use Audience Network to extend their campaigns to LiveRail and mobile apps. What You Should Know: Facebook understands its users’ identities in a way most platforms don’t. And the company’s wealth of user data means it can target ads more accurately.\\n\\n\\nGoogle is making a serious telecom play, and US telcos are nervous: First it conquered search. Then it was online video and advertising. Now Google is turning its attention toward telecom — and it’s no experiment. In recent months, Google has said it’s bringing ultra-fast Internet to at least 18 cities, including Atlanta and Nashville. It announced pilot tests of a low-cost, modular smartphone. The company’s joined an influential lobbying group for upstart telecom firms. And now Google is considering an entry into wireless service, as first reported by The Information, a technology news site founded by former Wall Street Journal reporter Jessica Lessin. All this adds up to what appears to be a serious play in the communications space, with broad implications for what consumers will pay for service, how businesses will compete and even the regulations that affect how Americans experience their technology. Google would reportedly offer wireless service by piggybacking off of Sprint and T-Mobile’s networks — essentially paying those companies so that Google can resell their services under its own brand. In addition, it would blend the two networks and allow its customers to hop between them depending on which carrier’s signal is strongest. Phones on the Google service would also be able to make calls over WiFi hotspots, meaning that at all times, devices would be hunting for the best of three options. Combine that with its forthcoming smartphone, the Android operating system and the Google-owned apps that ride on top of it all, and you’d get a formidable silo of hardware, software and services. \\n\\n\\nRocket\\'s Foodpanda.com has bought Indian rival Just Eat India, financials not disclosed: Foodpanda.com, a Rocket Internet-backed global, multi-location online food ordering marketplace (which operates under Hellofood brand in some markets) has acquired its Indian rival Just Eat India. The transaction details are not disclosed. Founded in April 2012, Foodpanda features location-specific listing of restaurants on its site. Users can check out menus, along with special offers, post that they can order and get food delivered to their homes. One can also search for restaurants according to cuisine, and/or by other parameters such as vegetarian/non-veg, healthy food, etc. The company helps restaurants increase sales through online and mobile platforms and also provides them with technology and analytics. Last year, the firm had raised $20 million in funding from Phenomen Ventures, a Russia-based venture capital firm and a group of unnamed investors. Globally, the company is present in over 40 countries in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. Just Eat Plc was launched in Denmark in 2001 and was traded publicly on the London Stock Exchange. The company’s Indian business was launched as ‘Hungry Bangalore’ back in 2006, but was renamed (in 2011) when Just Eat acquired a majority stake in the business. In this space, Mumbai-based hybrid startup incubation platform Antfarm Business Incubator Pvt Ltd (Ant Farm) had acquired city-based food delivery venture Meals on Wheels, run by Meal O Wheel Pvt Ltd, in a stock-and-cash deal worth Rs 11-15 crore ($1.7-2.4 million) in November 2014.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter Q4 earnings: revenue $479M, +97% Y/Y; net loss narrows to $125M,\\xa0stock up 11% on monetization success, but\\xa0user growth continues to fall:\\xa0Twitter on Thursday said its fourth-quarter revenue increased 97 percent to $479.1 million, with the net loss narrowing to $125.4 million. The San Francisco-based company also projected adding 13 million to 16 million users in the first quarter, up 4.5 percent sequentially -- faster than the 1.4 percent growth in the prior period. The results sent Twitter’s shares soaring in extended trading, adding to gains so far this year that are reversing last year’s 44 percent stock price drop. Chief Executive Officer Costolo, who has been under fire for the company’s slowing user growth and management turbulence, is working to recover investor trust by rolling out new features to attract people to the microblogging site and to rev up advertising revenue. “We know they have the monetization tools to significantly grow the business,” said James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co., adding that investors may forgive Twitter for slow user growth because of moves to distribute tweets more widely. “They get a pass this time.” Twitter isn’t out of the woods with investors. The company’s membership growth continues to decelerate year-over-year, even with the forecast for user growth to pick up sequentially in the current quarter. For the fourth quarter, monthly active users increased 20 percent from a year ago to 288 million, compared with 23 percent growth in the prior period. The company said the rollout of a new mobile operating system from Apple Inc. and integration issues cost it 4 million new users. For the first quarter, Twitter projected revenue of $440 million to $450 million, compared with the average analyst estimate of $449.9 million. “He did a great job taking some fairly negative results and putting them in a positive light,” Nate Elliott, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc., said of Costolo. “But the fact is, every quarter they make a big deal about how important it is to grow their user base, and every quarter they fail.” The changes are intended to keep people glued to Twitter’s product for longer. In the fourth quarter, the company said its members viewed their timelines more often, with 182 billion views, compared with 181 billion in the prior quarter. Mobile advertising was 88 percent of total ad revenue in the fourth quarter, Twitter said. International revenue more than doubled. \\n\\n\\nTwitters\\'s slowing user engagement is posing existential questions though: Here’s Twitter’s Slowing User Growth In One Chart: The company added a mere 4 million new monthly active users in the quarter, which is an adjustment that it will likely explain on its earnings call. That 4 million figure bumped Twitter’s monthly active user tally up from 284 million in its third quarter, to 288 million in the fourth. Up 20 percent compared to the year-ago quarter, it was a gain of just 1.4 percent on a sequential-quarter basis. Here’s the carnage: Twitter is still growing, but that final figure is dangerously close to zero. And if Twitter actually stops growing, even for a quarter, and shrinks, expect investors to release holy hell all over the company’s management team.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\n\\nSource: TechCrunch: Here’s Twitter’s Slowing User Growth In One Chart:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLinkedIn Q4 earnings revenue $643M, +44% Y/Y; net income $3.1M; strong hiring environment and success in China send shares up 7%: LinkedIn reported a higher-than-expected 44 percent jump in quarterly revenue as more businesses used its services to assess candidates for employment. The company\\'s shares rose 8 percent after the bell. LinkedIn\\'s hiring business has been thriving, clocking revenue growth of nearly 50 percent in each of the last three quarters, helped by rapid expansion in international markets such as China. \"In the fourth-quarter, more than 75 percent of new members came to LinkedIn from outside the United States,\" Chief Executive Jeff Weiner said on a post-earnings call. The company added 3,000 new customers to its hiring business in the quarter, Chief Financial Officer Steve Sordello said. Revenue in LinkedIn\\'s hiring business, called Talent Solutions, jumped 41 percent to $369.3 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, accounting for 57 percent of the company\\'s revenue. The company\\'s net income fell to $3.1 million, or 2 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from $3.8 million, or 3 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 61 cents per share. Revenue rose to $643.4 million from $447.2 million. LinkedIn also forecast an adjusted profit of $2.95 per share for 2015, above the average analyst estimate of $2.73. LinkedIn\\'s shares were trading at $255.55 after closing at $237.97 on Thursday.\\n\\n\\nIndian startup action: Alipay comes to India: investment in One97 confirmed; will acquire 25% stake - financials not disclosed: (more coverage here) Ant Financial, the affiliate group of Alibaba that oversees its third-party payment service Alipay, has invested in India’s One97, the parent company of third-party payment service Paytm, Bloomberg reports. The size of the investment has not been disclosed, but Ant Financial will take a 25 percent stake in the New Delhi-based firm. Rumors of the investment had been circulating for weeks, with the Wall Street Journal and others reporting the round was worth US$575 million. Paytm is a payment processor built specifically for India’s mobile shoppers. The Reserve Bank of India places tough restrictions on companies looking to receive a PPI license (prepaid payment instrument) license, so Paytm’s permission, coupled with its two-tap checkout procedure, have helped it gain strong traction domestically. When Tech in Asia profiled the company in October 2014, founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma claimed that Paytm was processing 600,000 orders every day, and 5 million orders on mobile every month. Ant Financial Services Group, China’s leading online financial services company that owns AliPay, is all set to acquire 25 per cent stake in Noida-headquartered mobile internet firm One97 Communications Ltd. The financials of the deal are not disclosed. Ant Financial, an affiliate of China’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, will provide One97’s m-com and virtual wallet property Paytm with strategic and technical support for its business, following the deal. The companies will also build on synergies in the mobile wallet front. This deal also marks Ant Financial’s entry into the Indian market. Last month, Techcircle.in had reported that One97 is raising $575 million from the world’s largest e-com firm Alibaba and the group’s separate payment unit Alipay. This was in addition to $60 million more from existing lead investor SAIF Partners. One97 had zeroed in on Alibaba Group as the new investor after negotiating with various possible suitors including Singapore’s state-owned investment firm Temasek among others. It had signed a term-sheet for investment with Temasek as first reported by Techcircle.in but decided to go ahead with a deal with Alibaba. Founded in 2000, One97 Communications is a leading mobile-internet company in India that offers digital goods & services to its mobile consumers under the Paytm brand. It also provides mobile advertising, marketing and payments for merchants. In addition, it has a partnership with existing lead investor SAIF Partners where it invests in early stage mobile internet startups through One97 Mobility Fund.\\n\\n\\nIndian startup action: India’s FreeCharge, Which Gives Users Coupons When They Pay Bills, Raises $80M Series C: FreeCharge, an India-based mobile commerce platform that gives users coupons and other rewards when they pay their phone, satellite television, and utility bills, has raised an $80 million series C. The round included new investors Valiant Capital Management and Tybourne Capital Management, as well as returning investors Sequoia Capital, RuNet, and Sofina. TechCrunch last covered FreeCharge in September, when it raised a $33 million Series B. Its latest funding brings FreeCharge’s total raised so far to about $115 million. The company says it now has a customer base of more than 20 million. Its mobile app was downloaded 10 million times last year. Customers use FreeCharge by logging onto its website or mobile apps to top up their prepaid mobile phone plans or pay TV and utility bills. FreeCharge then emails them coupons which can be redeemed at leading e-commerce sites like Flipkart and Amazon India or in brick-and-mortar retailers such as McDonalds, Baskin Robbins, and coffee shops. For participating vendors, FreeCharge offers insight into consumer behavior by tracking which coupons are redeemed and what products or services they are used for. In addition to providing coupons, FreeCharge eventually plans to expand into transaction advertising. It is eyeing growth in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Africa\\n\\n\\nMajor hacker attack on US insurance giant Anthem - motives unclear, but fears of Chinese state-sponsored group involvement:: A hack at Anthem, the second-largest health insurer in the country, exposed personal information about millions of employees and customers. But the attack is just the latest evidence that cybercriminals are increasingly targeting the medical sector where they can collect health information that can be sold for a premium on the black market. \"What we\\'ve seen in the last few years is that attackers have realized the economics of health-care data are very, very attractive,\" says Lee Weiner, senior vice president at cybersecurity firm Rapid7. Anthem said hackers collected several pieces of personal information about its employees and customers, including Social Security numbers, birthdays and street and e-mail addresses. But the hack also included medical information numbers, which can be among the most damaging types of stolen data and be used to commit medical fraud, according to security experts. Complete health insurance credentials sold for $20 a piece on underground markets in 2013, according to Dell SecureWorks. That is 10 to 20 times more than a U.S. credit card number with a security code. Fears of Chinese state-sponsored group involvement: Investigators of Anthem Inc.’s data breach are pursuing evidence that points to Chinese state-sponsored hackers who are stealing personal information from health-care companies for purposes other than pure profit, according to three people familiar with the probe. The breach, which exposed Social Security numbers and other sensitive details of 80 million customers, is one of the biggest thefts of medical-related customer data in U.S. history.  The attack appears to follow a pattern of thefts of medical data by foreigners seeking a pathway into the personal lives and computers of a select group -- defense contractors, government workers and others, according to a U.S. government official familiar with a more than year-long investigation into the evidence of a broader campaign. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is leading the investigation, according to Anthem, which has hired FireEye Inc., a Milpitas, California-based security company, to assist. China has said in the past that it doesn’t conduct espionage through hacking. The Chinese embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Hackers could use stolen information -- which Anthem said in its case included birthdates and e-mail addresses -- to conduct “phishing” attacks on customers who unwittingly provide access to their companies’ networks. Government officials have been investigating whether foreign interests are using personal, financial or medical information as leverage to gain intelligence from people who want their information to stay private, according to the U.S. official.\\n\\n\\nLeaking can be risky: SEC investigates options trades on Blackberry-Samsung rumors: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating a January 14 spike in trading in BlackBerry Ltd options that took place hours before Reuters reported that Samsung Electronics Co was in talks to buy the Canadian smartphone maker, according to a person familiar with the investigation. One trade the SEC is looking at took place at 12:06 p.m. on that day, when there was a purchase of options with the rights to buy 200,000 shares of BlackBerry stock at a strike price of $10 a share, the person said. Later that afternoon, Reuters reported that Samsung had offered to buy BlackBerry for as much as $7.5 billion, valuing its stock at between $13.35 to $15.49 per share, a 38 percent to 60 percent premium over BlackBerry’s trading price at the time. BlackBerry’s stock, which closed on Jan. 13 at $9.71, shot up 30% on the news to close at $12.60 on Jan. 14, its biggest one-day gain in years. The call options, which expired on January 23, were purchased for 10 cents in the trade. They surged on the Reuters story to a high of $2.55. If the buyer had been able to sell the options at that high they would have been able to make a profit of $490,000 on a $20,000 investment. It is unclear, though, whether the buyer was able to sell the options at a profit. The SEC is investigating whether a source of information provided to Reuters bought Blackberry options, according to the person familiar with the investigation. Both companies later denied they were in talks and BlackBerry’s shares tumbled. Reuters subsequently corrected its story to make clear that the discussions were between advisors rather than company officials. There is no indication that Reuters is a target of the investigation. A spokeswoman for Thomson Reuters declined to comment.\\n\\n\\nA sad day: RadioShack has officially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Once a home base to the radio/homebrew/DIY geeks of the world, RadioShack devolved into a glorified cell phone store in the early 2000s. While they’ve spent the last few years trying to find their roots with things like a dedicated section for Arduino gear*, they’ve mostly failed to get bodies back in the store.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter, Google strike deal; real-time tweets will feature in search results again; Twitter will receive licensing revenue;\\xa0scaled down ambitions for Google+:\\xa0Twitter is reported to have struck a significant partnership with Google on the eve of its latest financial results. Bloomberg reports that the two companies have agreed to a deal to put real-time tweets from Twitter back into Google’s search results sometime “in the first half of this year.” The partnership would give Google access to Twitter’s data ‘fire hose’ again, something that search rivals Yahoo and (Microsoft) Bing already enjoy. Twitter and Google struck a similar agreement back in 2009, but it was not renewed in 2011. That left Google needing to crawl the Twitter services to index tweet — a process that takes time. Terms of this apparent new deal will make tweets visible inside Google’s search results immediately after they are tweeted out. This coming together would be significant for a couple of reasons. Bloomberg’s sources claim there is no advertising revenue deal here, but Google will reportedly pay “data-licensing” revenue. That’s a revenue line item that Twitter grew from $16 million to $41 million in the past year, and — with Google on board — there’s more to come. Secondly, with Twitter expanding the scope of its advertising this week so that Promoted Tweets appear on third party apps and sites — starting with Flipboard and Yahoo Japan — the company is keen to pull in and monetize visitors to its service who are not registered Twitter users. Appearing more prominently in Google’s search results page could significantly boost this business. The deal may be positive for Twitter, but it could have implications for Google’s own social network. One of the positive features about Google+, the company’s own social service, was that updates prominently in search results — potentially driving new traffic websites and bringing more business for companies. The prospect of real-time Twitter returning is yet another signal that Google is stepping off the gas for Google+ — Vic Gundotra, who lead the service, left Google last April, as the company started viewing Google+ as a platform rather than a product.\\n\\n\\nTinder has redefined user behavior and is driving an explosion in online dating: Online dating, long dominated by big outfits like Match.com and eHarmony, has in the last two years been transformed by the rise of Tinder, the mobile phone app that lets its users scan photos and short profiles of potential dates. Then, as easy as a swipe of a finger, you can decide if you want to chat or pass on a prospect. But Tinder’s free app isn’t the only mobile dating game in town. Many app makers are trying to capitalize on the Tinder method of simple, smartphone-based dating. Of course, they add a twist to the swipe. An app called Hinge sifts only through your Facebook connections for friends of friends. Clover offers Tinder-like features but with an added, if dubious, bonus called “On-Demand Dating.” Think Uber for dating — you pick a location and a date, and Clover sends someone to meet you. And there are others with variations on the theme, including How About We, where you pose an idea for a fun date and see who bites, and the League, sort of a mobile dating app for the 1 percent: it promotes exclusivity and a carefully selected clientele. It’s easier, faster and more discreet to swipe through an app than to create laborious online profiles. The downside of that convenience is uncertainty, since mobile profiles tend to be sparse or nonexistent. Still, this simplicity has caused Tinder’s growth to explode in just two years. According to the company, it processes more than one billion swipes a day and matches some 12 million people a day. A “match” means two people agreed they were interested in one another. From there, they can choose whether to exchange messages or meet in person. Traditional dating sites like Match.com, eHarmony and OkCupid also have apps that let their users keep tabs on their profiles, messages and matches, of course. In fact Tinder, Match and OkCupid, among other dating sites, are all part of the IAC/InterActiveCorp media conglomerate. Amarnath Thombre, president of Match.com in North America, said that in the last year it had registered a 35 percent increase in the people who use Match through the app each month, and a 109 percent increase in the number of people who use only the app to reach Match every month. But he acknowledged that Tinder was creating an entirely new audience of digital daters. “What Tinder especially has accomplished, which I think none of our competitors could achieve before, is that it opened up this young demographic — 18- to 25-year-olds — that no product could open up before,” Mr. Thombre said.\\n\\n\\nTinder is starting to monetize - The Gap just ran a guerilla campaign on the app, its first. When you\\'re flipping through Tinder looking for a Valentine\\'s date, you might run into The Gap, too. The clothing company is launching a new ad campaign on the hot dating app, it said today. The Tinder ads are one part of The Gap\\'s new campaign ahead of its spring line, which includes a new micro-series filmed for Instagram starring Jenny Slate and Paul Dano. \"We did a little something special on Tinder,\" said Tricia Nichols, The Gap\\'s leader of consumer engagement and brand strategies. \"It\\'s a guerrilla [marketing] idea where you\\'ll see a profile with clever messaging in the spirit of love and the perfect match. It\\'s the perfect fit for Tinder.\" It\\'s also an unusual fit for Tinder. Until now, the dating app has not had many ad campaigns, especially from fashion brands. However, owned by IAC/InterActive, Tinder is looking for sources of revenue, offering a new premium ad-free option and running ads on the free service. This is the Gap\\'s first ad on the app, and the retailer declined to reveal how much the placement cost. \\n\\n\\nCanalys study: Micromax overtakes Samsung as India\\'s #1 smartphone supplier; Karbonn and Lava stay at #3 and #4; Samsung disputes findings: Smartphone maker Micromax has surpassed Samsung in the fourth quarter of 2014 to become the leading supplier in India’s booming smartphone market for the first time, according to a report by Canalys. Micromax accounted for 22 percent of smartphone shipments in India in the October-December quarter, up from 21 per cent in the previous quarter. Samsung’s market share fell 2 percent points sequentially to 20 per cent in the fourth quarter. This performance is partly due to Micromax’s continuing appeal to users upgrading to smartphones by catering to local market preferences, which has become increasingly important in India. “Micromax has been quicker than its competitors to improve the appeal of devices, for example, they included a wide variety of local languages on its Unite phones,” said Rushabh Doshi, analyst at Canalys. The firm said Micromax’s flagship line of products has also effectively targeted the INR 9,000 to INR 12,000 (US$150 to US$200) segment, with products such as the Canvas Nitro and Canvas Hue. Karbonn remained at the third spot followed by another domestic vendor, Lava. A total of 21.6 million smartphones were shipped in India in last quarter, up from 18.9 million in the third quarter. 41 percent were of devices in the INR 6,000 to INR 12,000 bracket (US$100 to US$200) while 23 percent of shipments were of devices priced under INR 6,000 ($100). Samsung is denying these numbers, and states that according to its own data, its share is nearly double to that of its closest rival.\\n\\n\\nSouth Korea is showing real intent in taking on Uber: South Korea on Thursday rejected online ride-sharing firm Uber Technologies Inc\\'s proposal for a new driver registration system, and vowed to shut down the U.S. company\\'s operations. Uber on Wednesday proposed a registration system to allow its drivers to operate legally in Asia\\'s fourth-largest economy, where CEO Travis Kalanick and the head of the company\\'s South Korean unit have been indicted for violating licensing rules. But the transport ministry said a parallel taxi registration system was unacceptable in a market already over-supplied with taxis. \"Transporting customers with private or rented cars and accepting compensation is clearly illegal. The company is ignoring local laws by stating its intention to continue such operations,\" the ministry said in a statement. It said it would continue to curtail Uber\\'s activities and work with legislators to ban the service. In January, the city of Seoul started offering rewards of up to 1 million won ($929) for people who reported private or rented car drivers providing transport through Uber.\\n\\n\\nTemasek invests $60M in analytics firm Manthan; Mu Sigma is reportedly in talks to raise $200M: Singapore’s state owned investment firm Temasek has led a $60 million (Rs 370 crore) investment round in Bangalore-based Manthan Software Services Pvt Ltd, a provider of business intelligence and Big Data analytics solutions for enterprises. Existing investor Norwest Venture Partners also participated, according to a top executive of the company. The investment includes both a primary issue where Manthan gets fresh financial resource as well as a secondary component where one of the three existing investors IDG Ventures has exited from the company. Another existing investor Fidelity has partially exited. The quantum of money going into the firm could not be immediately ascertained but a Mint report said the firm received Rs 105 crore as part of the investment round a few weeks ago. With headquarters in Bangalore, the firm also has offices in the US, the UK, the Philippines, Singapore and Brazil. In the space, Bangalore-based pure-play analytics provider Fractal Analytics raised an undisclosed amount in funding from Canadian loyalty management firm Aimia. India- and US-based Mu Sigma Inc., one of the leading Big Data analytics companies in the world, is in talks with a group of investors to raise upwards of $200 million in fresh funding.\\n\\n\\nConsolidation: Rumors swirl that Uber is looking to buy Meru and Olacabs is looking to buy TaxiForSure: Uber now reportedly in talks to buy Meru while Olacabs is said to be eyeing TaxiForSure. For all we know these could be just rumours possibly meant to scupper independent fundraising plans of the individual ventures. Both Meru and Uber have denied the reports calling it untrue. Meru, a legacy radio cab firm  owns several thousands of cars. However, the business model can be easily pivoted by leasing out the cars to fleet ownership and management firms. What’s more, it could hive off the car assets into another company which could be sold off to another firm thus separating the cars from Meru’s balance sheet. This is exactly what Flipkart did when it separated the legal ownership of WS Retail, its single largest vendor. That would make Meru a marketplace like its other fast growing peers. Last year Meru’s chief Sidharth Pahwa told us that around 60 per cent of the cars are not owned by the firm and that figure could well have got bumped up further.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba ties up with online marketplace lending giant to bring unsecured loans to American businesses looking to order from Alibaba: The companies behind two of the hottest stock market debuts of 2014, Lending Club and the Alibaba Group, are teaming up — to help American companies buy parts from Chinese manufacturers. The two announced on Tuesday that they would form a partnership to provide financing for manufacturers in the United States to buy products and supplies through the Chinese marketplace Alibaba.com. Through Lending Club, the giant of the online marketplace lending industry, those companies can line up from $5,000 to as much as $300,000 for each purchase order. It’s an unusual move meant in part to replace traditional business supply-chain borrowing, at least for the small- to medium-size businesses that look to Alibaba for a portion of their manufacturing. Rather than have to rely on banks or other traditional lenders who require collateral for their financing, these customers can instead use Lending Club’s systems to procure an unsecured loan with near-instant approval. it is a unifying of two of the most talked-about online marketplaces of the moment. Alibaba is one of China’s biggest Internet companies, whose multiple platforms — including Alibaba.com, which is meant for wholesale purchases — draw millions of customers. And Lending Club helped define what once was known as peer-to-peer lending, in which potential investors can go online to be matched with hopeful borrowers. The loans for the new venture, to be called “Alibaba.com e-Credit Line, Powered by Lending Club,” comes at lower interest rates than what others can provide. According to Mr. Laplanche, the new venture offers a monthly interest rate starting at 0.5 percent, about half of what a more traditional lender could provide. But unlike more traditional manufacturing financing options, such as “factoring,” the loans aren’t backed by particular assets. Alibaba had begun searching for a lending partner several months ago, eventually reaching out to both traditional banks and newer market-based lenders. After what amounted to a lengthy audition process, including trips to Alibaba’s offices in China, the Chinese e-commerce giant ultimately chose to go with Lending Club. “First of all, they are also a platform business,” Michael Lee, Alibaba.com’s global marketing and business development director, said in a telephone interview, adding that customers had asked for an simple financing solution for some time. “They are also very transparent with their rate and the way they do business. And they got good feedback from their own users.” For Alibaba, according to Mr. Lee, the hope is that customers will use such financing to make orders at least once a year. And if the system proves as easy to use as both sides hope, it could help convince more American businesses to order from Alibaba.com more often. For Lending Club, the move is meant to help further a move into new kinds of lending. Though it began life by offering debt consolidation loans to help pay off credit cards, the company has pushed to enter new kinds of financing, including elective surgical procedures and small-business loans.\\n\\n\\nAs RadioShack files for bankruptcy, Amazon is considering buying some of its brick-and-mortar locations: Amazon, aiming to bolster its brick-and-mortar operations, has discussed acquiring some RadioShack Corp. locations after the electronics chain files for bankruptcy, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Amazon has considered using the RadioShack stores as showcases for the Seattle-based company’s hardware, as well as potential pickup and drop-off centers for online customers, said one of the people, who asked not to be named because the deliberations are private. The possible move, discussed as part of RadioShack’s looming trip to bankruptcy court, would represent Amazon’s biggest push into traditional retail. Amazon joins other potential bidders, including Sprint Corp. and the investment group behind Brookstone, in evaluating RadioShack stores, people familiar with the situation said. RadioShack has more than 4,000 U.S. locations and is moving toward a deal to sell a portion and close the rest, according to some of the people. Sprint has discussed buying 1,300 to 2,000, they said.\\n\\n\\nAlan Eustace, SVP of Knowledge, is leaving Google: Alan Eustace, a longtime Google employee and its SVP of Knowledge — and also the current world-record holder for making the highest-altitude free-fall jump — is leaving the company. Eustace is not departing for another role elsewhere but is retiring, from what we understand. The news was conveyed to staff by internal memo, and it’s not clear who will be taking over his role and/or if there are any other departures. We’ve been told by a source that Google has been working through a larger reorganization of its business. Eustace had been looking to leave for a while and seized the moment. Things have been moving around at the executive level of Google in the last several months. In October last year (literally the same day Eustace set his skydiving record), several divisions of the company were centralised under Sundar Pichai, including Eustace’s research operations. Shortly after that, Android pioneer Andy Rubin left the company. Other research leaders who have left Google include Sebastian Thrun, who helped found Google X to develop “moonshot” products and technology. He stepped away from his VP and Fellow roles at the company last September to focus more on his education startup Udacity. Google is a company in transition, with the company’s widened focus today on areas like mobile, video, driverless cars, cloud-based services like maps and other apps, and connected home products, expanding its reach it well beyond the search business that was its main operation when Eustace joined in 2002.\\n\\n\\nTwitter stock jumped more than 6% as investors cheered its ad distribution deals for Promoted Tweets on Flipboard, Yahoo Japan. The stock was up on Tuesday after the social media company said its promoted tweets will appear on third-party mobile apps and websites under a new advertising distribution program. The syndication program will broaden the reach of Twitter\\'s ads beyond the 284 million monthly users who access its service every month, Twitter said. Its first partners are newsreader app Flipboard and Yahoo Japan. \"For the thousands of brands already advertising on Twitter, these new partnerships open a significant opportunity to extend the reach of their message to a larger audience,\" Twitter said in a post on its official blog. Twitter is due to report its fourth-quarter financial results on Thursday. The company\\'s stock price has been under pressure, down roughly 40 percent from its 52-week high of $67.24, on investor concerns that it is struggling to add new users to its service. Promoted tweets are going to show up outside of Twitter for the first time, the company announced today, revealing part of its strategy for increasing ad exposure that had been been limited to its own site and apps. Now, it will serve paid Twitter messages to partner sites and apps, including Flipboard and Yahoo Japan, partly owned by Yahoo. Both Web properties already have strong Twitter integrations with sections devoted to streams of activity powered by the social messaging site. Twitter said its Promoted Tweets would show up in those Twitter content areas on the third-party sites, as well as in other sections of the sites, and the ads would have the \"same look and feel that is native\" to the experiences on them. Twitter also said brands would be able to use the same targeting data and creative they use on its platform to reach users with these syndicated tweets. It is clear why Twitter is looking to expand its ad business off its own ad platform, a strategy it started wholly embracing when it bought the ad network MoPub in 2013: It needs to find larger audiences than it attracts on its own. With MoPub, Twitter has said it can hit more than 1 billion users on mobile devices across various Web properties. While announcing syndicated Promoted Tweets, it said that last quarter tweets generated 185 billion impressions outside Twitter.\\n\\n\\nTencent blocked key Alibaba apps ahead of the Spring Festival Holiday: As China’s massive Spring Festival holiday approaches, the folks at Tencent WeChat have been busy pressing the delete key on links between their app and a number of Alibaba services. First, Sina Tech reported that WeChat had shut down a sharing like with Alibaba’s Alipay that allowed Alipay users to send digital Spring Festival red envelopes of money to WeChat friends. Now, it appears WeChat has also shut down sharing connections with Alibaba music apps Xiami and Tiantian Dongting, meaning users can no longer share content from those apps directly with their WeChat friends. The Alipay closure is less of a surprise, as the two companies have been slugging it out over red envelopes for a couple of years now. WeChat has its own red-envelope-sending service, so stopping Alipay users from sending money easily to their WeChat friends makes some sense. If WeChat users can’t send money through Alipay, they might just send it through WeChat’s built-in service. That way Tencent, rather than Alibaba, earns money from the transaction. And with the Spring Festival holiday fast approaching, red envelope transactions will soon reach their yearlong high. It’s less clear why WeChat has closed its sharing connections with Alibaba music apps Xiami and Tiantian Dongting. No app-specific reason is apparent, but Tencent and Alibaba have been rivals for some time. Now it seems Tencent is declaring all-out war on Alibaba, and shutting down the connections between Alibaba’s apps and its own uber-popular social platform.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s been a decade since Amazon introduced its Prime service, which waives fees for two-day shipping and includes perks such as access to Amazon\\'s streaming video library -- for $99 per year. When Amazon first announced Prime in a 2005 earnings call, skeptics wondered how the company would make the then-$79 annual fee palatable to consumers -- and how it was going to foot the bill if the program caught on. A decade later, Amazon says Prime memberships number in the tens of millions and are growing. Over the past year alone, memberships have shot up 53 percent. On the day after Christmas, Amazon said 10 million people had signed up for Prime \"this holiday season.\" Greg Greeley, the vice president of Amazon Prime Global:  Prime introduced three concepts. It had two-day shipping at a time when people expected to pay for shipping and still not get their items for four to seven business days. It was very predictable: We put it on the Web site that if you ordered in the next 3 hours and 20 min., for example, you could have it in two days. And it was an unlimited, single membership fee that made fast delivery an everyday experience instead of an occasional indulgence. They are much more engaged. One of the benefits to them and us is that we’re top of mind -- they don’t have to drive around for a hard-to-find item. On the app or on the PC, they\\'re engaged on the other benefits as well. Prime offerings are always either [fulfilled by Amazon] or retail.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon\\'s strong Q4 profits (and slowing revenue) were both driven by a surge in marketplace:\\xa0\"Q4 2014 was whene Amazon flexed its marketplace muscles: After analyzing all the data, this quarter was a real stand out for the Amazon third-party marketplace.   In fact, Amazon has started to open the kimono a bit on how much they reveal about the 3P business (particularly FBA) and it was all very strong in Q4.  In fact, I’d go so far as to say the marketplace simultaneously drove the improved margin picture at Amazon and the revenue decline (will describe that in a future post). Acceleration – As mentioned above, the 3PM really accelerated to levels we haven’t seen in a long, long time.  33% y/y growth in a 15% e-commerce backdrop is quite impressive. 3P unit share – Another stand out metric from Q4 was Amazon announced that 43% of paid units came from third party sellers. Paid item growth -Paid item growth came in at 20%, flat with Q3. Media share – Media hit a low-water mark of 24% with EGM at a high-water mark of 70% (the missing 6% is other -ads and AWS). Geographical mix - Amazon’s revenues were 64% North American and 36% rest of world (Amazon’s largest regions outside the US are Germany, Japan and UK).  See below for the details on geo mix. Active users – If there was a blemish on Q4, it was units/user and active users.  Active users grew only 16% y/y to 270 (a slow-down from Q3’s 16% growth rate). Units per user – One interesting metric is the units/user – this metric shows us buyer frequency.  In other words, are buyers increasingly active or decreasing activity. Of course, increasing is good and programs like Prime, and recommendations and upsells are working.  Units per user was up .6% which is a bit of a slowdown.\"\\n\\n\\nEven-steven: Apple will spend $2B on a data center in Arizona, even as AT&T sells data center assets worth $2B: On Monday, Arizona announced that Apple would invest $2 billion in the creation of a data center at a facility in Mesa after its original plans to produce sapphire, a material tougher than glass, there were abandoned. Apple had contracted GT Advanced Technologies, a sapphire producer, to make sapphire screens for iPhones, among other things. But to Apple’s surprise, GTAT declared bankruptcy last October after failing to meet some of Apple’s demands. As a result, Apple released it latest iPhones without sapphire. While Apple may have abandoned sapphire production at the Arizona facility, the company has not given up on the facility itself, which measures 1.3 million square feet. Apple on Monday said that the multibillion-dollar investment in the data center was one of its most significant investments ever, creating 600 engineering and construction jobs. The center will be partly used as a central command center for monitoring Apple’s other data centers around the world, the company said. AT&T Inc is selling some data centers worth about $2 billion as it continues its streak of asset sales, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. AT&T, the No. 2 U.S wireless provider, has been exploring options to pay down its debt and raise funds for investments in recent months. The company declined to comment. The three sources requested anonymity because the matter is not public. AT&T and its rival Verizon have been selling non-core assets in recent months. Verizon is close to announcing divestitures of wireless towers and wireline markets worth $10 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. AT&T hired a financial adviser to assist in the sale. Following spectrum investments and pending acquisitions, AT&T\\'s debt ratio may rise in the near term, the company said last week after spending close to half of the total bids in the record-setting $44.9 billion spectrum sale that concluded last week. AT&T emerged the top bidder in the AWS-3 spectrum auction by bagging 251 licenses worth $18.2 billion.\\n\\n\\nApple sold $6.5 billion in bonds on strong demand..: after boosting the deal by 30 percent, in the iPhone maker’s fourth major debt offering in the past two years as it preserves its overseas cash hoard. The company sold the securities in five parts, with the longest portion maturing in 30 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The deal will be used for stock repurchases, dividend payments and debt repayments, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has issued the equivalent of $39 billion of bonds since April 2013, when it sold $17 billion in what at the time was the biggest corporate-bond offering ever. The Cupertino, California-based company’s previous debt deal was a sale of 2.8 billion euros ($3.17 billion) in November that allowed it to fund shareholder rewards without using cash from abroad that would be subject to U.S. repatriation taxes. “The company is building on the momentum of a strong past couple of weeks,” Jody Lurie, a corporate credit analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, which manages $61 billion in assets, said in a telephone interview. “They are being advantageous with the current environment.” The company issued $2 billion of 3.45 percent 30-year notes at a yield of 125 basis points more than similar-dated Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. That’s more than the relative yield of 100 basis points the company paid on 30-year bonds in the April 2013 offering. The shortest maturity portions included $1.25 billion of 1.55 percent five-year bonds that yielded 42 basis points more than comparable Treasuries. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. Apple’s bonds have returned 13.6 percent since the start of last year, outperforming the 10.3 percent gain in debt of similarly rated companies, and more than quadruple the 3.2 percent return on speculative-grade bonds, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch Indexes\\n\\n\\n..even as Netflix plans to raise $1B in borrowing despite a ratings downgrade: Netflix today said it plans to offer $1 billion in senior notes and plans to use the proceeds for “general corporate purposes, which may include content acquisitions, capital expenditures, investments, working capital and potential acquisitions and strategic transactions.” Markets are not entirely thrilled with the move. Netflix’s stock is trading down slightly, and S&P has downgraded the company’s debt rating to B+ from BB-. S&P notes that Netflix already has $9.5 billion streaming content commitment as of December 31, 2014, up from $7.3 billion a year earlier. “We expect that streaming content commitments will continue to increase and that Netflix’s pursuit of more original programming with global rights will increase its cash flow deficits,” it concludes.\\n\\n\\nTwitter out-performed Facebook during the Super Bowl, say some analysts:  Twitter appears to still be the place for live social media commentary, especially for brands that have to pay to get the most out of their Facebook activity. However, Facebook has made major efforts to capture the discussion, introducing trending topics (much like Twitter) and creating a Super Bowl hub for game chatter. Last night placed the two platforms head-to-head in a way that shows the benefits and drawbacks of both. In some areas, Twitter dominates, and Facebook controls others. Half the ads in the Super Bowl featured hashtags, while Facebook was mentioned four times. There were 265 million posts, comments and likes related to the Super Bowl on Facebook, the company said. Update: There were 36 million tweets related to the Super Bowl, up from about 25 million last year, and they recieved 2.5 billion impressions, according to Twitter.The conversation was most active on both platforms at the end of the game when New England sealed the victory with a last-second interception. Facebook said 1.36 million people per minute were discussing the Patriots\\' win by the end of the game. Twitter calculated 395,000 tweets per minute on the interception. Katy Perry\\'s halftime show generated 3 million tweets. Meanwhile, Facebook said more than 1 million people per minute discussed the performance in real time.\\n\\n\\nGoogle maybe getting ready to launch a competitor to Uber: Google Ventures, the search giant\\'s venture capital arm, invested $258 million in Uber in August 2013. It was Google Ventures\\' largest investment deal ever, and the company put more money into Uber\\'s next funding round less than a year later. Back then, it was easy for observers to imagine Google teaming closely with Uber, or even one day acquiring it. David Drummond, Google’s chief legal officer and senior vice president of corporate development, joined the Uber board of directors in 2013 and has served on it ever since. Now there are signs that the companies are more likely to be ferocious competitors than allies. Google is preparing to offer its own ride-hailing service, most likely in conjunction with its long-in-development driverless car project. Drummond has informed Uber\\'s board of this possibility, according to a person close to the Uber board, and Uber executives have seen screenshots of what appears to be a Google ride-sharing app that is currently being used by Google employees. This person, who requested not to be named because the talks are private, said the Uber board is now weighing whether to ask Drummond to resign his position as an Uber board member. have left executives at Uber deeply concerned—for good reason. Google is a deep-pocketed, technically sophisticated competitor, and Uber’s dependence on the search giant goes far beyond capital. Uber’s smartphone applications for drivers and riders are based on Google Maps, which gives Google a fire hose of data about transportation patterns within cities. Uber would be crippled if it lost access to the industry-leading mapping application, and alternatives— such as AOL\\'s MapQuest, Apple Maps, and a host of regional players—are widely seen as inferior. Google’s entrance into the ride-sharing market would also leave Uber without a partner in the suddenly plausible future in which cars without steering wheels roam the streets. Uber will either have to develop the technology itself or form an alliance with a company that can if it wants to offer autonomous vehicles within its fleet. Mercedes, Audi, Tesla, and other carmakers have said they are developing driverless cars, though it\\'s not clear that any is as advanced as Google\\'s. \\n\\n\\nLenovo Q4 earnings beat expectations on smartphone strength: revenue $14.1B, +31% Y/Y, net income $253M, down from $265M: Lenovo Group Ltd (0992.HK), the world\\'s leading PC maker, said on Tuesday its third-quarter revenue rose 31 percent to $14.1 bln, beating investor expectations, as its smartphone division sales more than doubled. The company said net profit was $253 million, down from $265 million a year prior due to ballooning operating expenses associated with two multi-billion dollar acquisitions completed in recent months. The results beat expectations of $13.71 billion in revenue and $200 million in net profit, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters SmartEstimates. The Beijing-based company acquired American phone brand Motorola for $2.91 billion and IBM\\'s low-end server unit for $2.1 billion to expand its business beyond the declining PC market. Lenovo, which closed the Motorola purchase in late October and included two months of Motorola\\'s results in this quarter\\'s earnings, touted the American handset brand\\'s early performance and said it achieved \"hyper growth\" in emerging markets outside China. Motorola sold more than 10 million handsets during the quarter, a company record, and its purchase by Lenovo made the combined company the world No. 3 smartphone maker with 6.6 percent market share, Lenovo said. Total sales from the mobile division rose 109 percent to $3.39 bln, or a quarter of the company\\'s sales. Lenovo continued to consolidate its hold on the shrinking PC market, reaching a record 20 percent share during the quarter with sales of $9.15 billion. Shipments rose 5 percent compared to a 3 percent decline in the broader industry, with growth particularly strong in Eastern Europe, Lenovo said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",
      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\nChinese agency softens criticism of Alibaba on sales of fake goods: It was only two days ago that a Chinese government regulator chastised the Alibaba Group, the e-commerce giant, for failing to curb the sale of fake goods on its sites. Now the two appear to have made up in a hurry. The regulator, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, said on Friday that its leader, Zhang Mao, had met with Alibaba’s executive chairman, Jack Ma, to discuss cooperating to fight counterfeiting and protect consumers. The agency made its criticism of Alibaba in a report released on Wednesday. But it is now backing away from the findings of that report, calling it a recounting of a July meeting between the two sides and not an official document with legal weight. It is a surprisingly quick turn of events for both Alibaba and the Chinese agency, given the public criticism that the S.A.I.C. delivered to one of its country’s most important Internet players. The S.A.I.C.’s blunt tone disappeared in the Friday statement. The agency described Alibaba as “steadfast and resolute” in fighting the sale of counterfeit goods, though it maintained that e-commerce platforms in China still needed to improve their self-policing. Both sides pledged to work more closely on matters like creating new regulatory mechanisms. “Both sides believe that the regulators and online platforms share the common interest to promote the healthy development of the online commerce industry and creating an online shopping environment where consumers feel safe and satisfied,” the regulator said, according to an English-language translation of its statement. In a post on its corporate blog, Alibaba said it planned to hire 300 people to form an anticounterfeiting task force to bolster its policing staff. A representative for Alibaba said in a statement: “The most recent S.A.I.C. posting speaks for itself. We feel vindicated.”\\n\\n\\nSome of the damage might be lasting though - Alibaba stock is down 15% in a week, and class action lawsuits in the US might follow non-disclosure of SAIC meeting before IPO: Alibaba\\'s representatives discussed the SAIC\\'s claims in meetings with the agency\\'s Internet regulation director, Liu Hongliang, in July—about two months before its record-breaking New York Stock Exchange debut. Did Alibaba need to disclose this information before going public? Following the plunge in Alibaba\\'s stock price, which has dropped almost 14 percent since Monday, the class action lawyers are taking aim at the company. Pomerantz, a firm that says it fights \"for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct,\" announced yesterday an investigation for Alibaba investors. Rosen Law Firm is investigating allegations the company \"may have issued materially misleading information to the investing public,\" the New York-based firm announced yesterday. The firm \"is preparing a class action lawsuit to recover losses suffered by [Alibaba] shareholders.\" Several other law firms have said they\\'re investigating, too. Responding to the law firms\\' announcements, Alibaba said today in a statement to Bloomberg that it is a company \"with strong values\" that \"will vigorously defend the truth and our reputation.\"\\n\\n\\nVerizon finally to allow complete opt-out of mobile ‘Supercookies’: (more coverage here)Verizon Wireless, which has been under fire by privacy advocates since late last year, has decided to make a major revision to its mobile ad-targeting program. Users who do not want to be tracked with an identifier that Verizon uses for ad-targeting purposes will soon be able to completely opt out, the company said on Friday. In the past, Verizon allowed users to opt out of the marketing side of the program, but they had no option to disable being tagged with its undeletable customer codes, which critics dubbed “supercookies.” Some security researchers quickly illustrated that third parties, like advertisers, could easily exploit Verizon’s persistent tracking to continually follow a user’s web browsing activities. In a recent interview, Praveen Atreya, a Verizon director who helped develop the technology behind the mobile marketing program, said the company was considering allowing its subscribers to opt out of being tagged with its undeletable customer codes. On Friday, Verizon confirmed this decision. But even if Verizon now allows subscribers to opt-out of having their online activities tracked using a unique customer code, that option may not satisfy privacy advocates who say consumers are unlikely to understand the implications of default tracking. Some say Verizon should have the feature turned off by default and require people to voluntarily switch it on. But whether Verizon ultimately gives its subscribers the choice to opt out or opt in, cyber-security experts say Verizon will still have to grapple with a basic issue: how to prevent third parties from hijacking its unique customer codes for their own purposes?\\n\\n\\nLine launches grocery delivery in Thailand, seeks to make jump to eCommerce from messaging as growth slows: (More coverage here) A month after introducing its own Uber-like service in Tokyo, Line — the Japanese messaging service known for its zany cartoon stickers — is taking a first step towards grocery sales and delivery in Southeast Asia, in the style of U.S. startup Instacart. Beginning in Thailand this week, where it claims 36 million registered users, Line will offer up a range of perishable and non-perishable goods via its messaging app. It is initially testing the concept using a daily deals model, which will include three daily deals and two “heavily discounted” offers per week, but there are plans to do more over time. The promotions will be publicized by three existing Line ‘brand’ accounts that have showcased promotions for consumer products since last year — in other words, Line users deliberately opt in for the grocery deals, it isn’t spam that is sent to all. The longer-term plan here is for Line to build out a fuller channel for food (and general) shopping across Southeast Asia. Finally, Line is promising free, next-day delivery for all purchases, although the company isn’t handling this side of the project. aCommerce — a Bangkok-based startup that raised $10.7 million from Docomo and others last summer, and works with Line on other commerce ventures — will provide the logistics and fulfillment backbone. Line claims 92 million active users across Japan, Thailand and Taiwan, and it seems feasible that a mobile commerce play could work in these markets. But its most recent financial report showed new user growth is slowing, and half of its 181 million active users worldwide is located in those three aforementioned countries. That makes the potential adoption of regional and global services somewhat uncertain at this point.\\n\\n\\nSpotify seeks to raise $500M at $6-7B valuation, delay IPO: Spotify, the popular streaming music service, has retained Goldman Sachs to raise $500 million in private investment, a move that would probably delay the possibility of an initial public stock offering in the near future.As a result of this latest round of investment, Spotify’s valuation would increase to at least $6 billion, and possibly $7 billion or more, according to a person briefed on the company’s plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In its last fund-raising round, in late 2013, it took in $250 million and was valued at more than $4 billion. Spotify says it now has 60 million users around the world, 15 million of whom pay. On Wednesday, it scored a coup in the digital music market when Sony said it would soon shut Music Unlimited, its failed streaming outlet, and replace it with Spotify.\\n\\n\\nGoogle CFO sounds unconcerned at prospect of browsers replacing Google as default search engine: Patrick Pichette, Google\\'s chief financial officer, says people can change. On Thursday\\'s earnings call, he suggested that people will seek out Google\\'s search engine even if their browsers default to a different one. \"If they love Google, they\\'ll continue to find Google, whichever platform, whichever browser,\" Pichette said on the call. \"The way to win in this in the long term is very simple. You just make wonderful products. And when you make wonderful products that are magical, people will find them.\" That\\'s some magical thinking, but it\\'s probably wrong. In November, Mozilla switched to Yahoo! as the default search engine on Firefox in the U.S. The next month, Google\\'s share of the U.S. search market sank 4 percentage points, the biggest drop since 2009, according to analytics firm StatCounter. That month, Yahoo increased its share by 3 percentage points. Pichette declined to comment on the Mozilla deal. Google isn\\'t in danger of losing its money-printing machine to Marissa Mayer any time soon. Even after that victory last month, the Yahoo chief executive officer has amassed just 10.4 percent of the U.S. search market. Google has 75.2 percent of it—and even more in Europe. There\\'s only so much impact Firefox can have. The once-dominant browser has been left hanging onto about 12 percent of U.S. users, according to StatCounter. And there\\'s still a chance that some Firefox faithful will switch their settings back to Google. The real reason Google investors are biting their nails over the Firefox deal is because Apple could do the same thing. Apple makes a lot of money from Google searches made through its Safari Web browser on the iPhone and iPad. But it\\'s no secret that relations between the two companies are about as deflated as Tom Brady\\'s footballs. Besides dropping Google Maps and YouTube from home screens, Apple went with Microsoft\\'s Bing to power Siri\\'s new search features. Microsoft knows better than anyone that default software settings stick. A few years back, Microsoft researchers discovered that less than 5 percent of users touch any application settings at all. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChina is cracking down on long-tolerated VPN workarounds, making internet censorship even more pervasive: China has long had some of the world’s most onerous Internet restrictions. But until now, the authorities had effectively tolerated the proliferation of V.P.N.s as a lifeline for millions of people, from archaeologists to foreign investors, who rely heavily on less-fettered access to the Internet. But earlier this week, after a number of V.P.N. companies, including StrongVPN and Golden Frog, complained that the Chinese government had disrupted their services with unprecedented sophistication, a senior official for the first time acknowledged its hand in the attacks and implicitly promised more of the same. The move to disable some of the most widely used V.P.N.s has provoked a torrent of outrage among video artists, entrepreneurs and professors who complain that in its quest for so-called cyber-sovereignty” — Beijing’s euphemism for online filtering — the Communist Party is stifling the innovation and productivity needed to revive the Chinese economy at a time of slowing growth. Multinational companies are also alarmed by the growing online constraints. Especially worrisome, they say, are new regulations that would force foreign technology and telecom companies to give the government “back doors” to their hardware and software and require them to store data within China. Like their Chinese counterparts, Western business owners have been complaining about their inability to gain access to many Google services since the summer. A few weeks ago, China cut off the ability to receive Gmail on smartphones through third-party email services like Apple Mail or Microsoft Outlook. The recent disabling of several widely used V.P.N.s has made it difficult for company employees to use collaborative programs like Google Docs, although some people have found workarounds — for the time being. By interfering with Astrill and several other popular virtual private networks, or V.P.N.s, the government has complicated the lives of Chinese astronomers seeking the latest scientific data from abroad, graphic designers shopping for clip art on Shutterstock and students submitting online applications to American universities.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba Q4 earnings disappoint: revenue $4.2B (+40% Y/Y), net income $964M, (-28% Y/Y), GMV $126.4B (+49% Y/Y), stock down 8%:\\xa0Alibaba said that in the quarter that ended on Dec. 31, its net profit jumped to $2.1 billion, above the $1.9 billion estimated by 23 analysts polled by Reuters, using figures derived from nonstandard accounting rules. Alibaba’s revenue rose to $4.2 billion from a year earlier but missed the $4.5 billion estimate of 27 analysts polled by Reuters. Alibaba also reported net profit using generally accepted accounting principles of $964 million, a drop of 28 percent from a year earlier. The company cited costs related to stock awards before its listing, taxes and fees.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAmazon Q4 earnings: revenue $29B, +15% Y/Y; surprise $214M profit sends stock up 13%:  Amazon reported a quarterly profit of $214 million Thursday, besting its own estimates and surprising investors. The news was enough to send the company\\'s stock up more than 13 percent to about $350 in after-hours trading. Revenue was up 15 percent to $29.33 billion. But analysts were expecting $29.67 billion. Analysts were anticipating 17 cents a share in profits, according to Thomson Reuters. When the retailer earned nearly three times that — 45 cents — on improved margins, it was a sign that maybe the sizable profits that all true believers in Amazon expect are on the way at last. Profits, however, were down from the fourth quarter of 2013, when Amazon earned 51 cents a share.\\xa0Prime is surging: Amazon’s delivery service, Prime, is surging. Amazon said its worldwide paid membership in Prime rose 53 percent in 2014. A price increase for Prime to $99 apparently discouraged few customers. Analysts say they think Prime has around 40 million members, although the company declined on Thursday to give a number or offer any hard facts about how much a new Prime member increases his shopping.\\xa0India was called out at the Amazon earnings call: Among the big e-commerce battlegrounds in the near future will be India. Amazon said on Thursday that it was already India’s largest e-commerce operation, just two years after opening. “We think it’s very, very early,” Mr. Szkutak said. “We are investing.”\\n\\n\\nGoogle Q4 earnings: revenue $18.1B, +15% Y/Y; net income $4.76B, shares flat on indifferent results: In the last three months of 2014, Google’s net revenue growth slowed to 10 percent when compared with the same quarter a year ago, according to an earnings report released Thursday. While impressive for a company with more than $60 billion in revenue, it is well short of the recent results of other tech industry standard-bearers, like Apple and Facebook. Google’s search business would still be the envy of most companies. Revenue from Google’s own sites, which includes things like its search engine and YouTube and accounts for a little more than two-thirds of the company’s business, increased 18 percent compared with a year ago. Indeed, Google’s share of search ad spending in the United States, including desktop and mobile devices, was 71.6 percent in 2014, according to eMarketer. In a conference call with Wall Street analysts, Google executives declined to answer questions about the company’s lesser-known businesses. But there were some indications of progress. Google said revenue in the “other” category — including the Play Store, where people can buy digital goods like mobile applications or streamed movies, and other services Google sells to businesses — increased 19 percent from the same quarter of last year, to $1.95 billion. The company reported revenue of $18.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, a 15 percent increase from the same period last year. Net revenue, which excludes payments to Google’s advertising partners, was $14.5 billion. Net income was $4.76 billion in the quarter, compared with $3.38 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. Earnings per share, not including certain charges, were slightly below analyst expectations. Analysts had also expected net revenue — the figure excluding advertiser payments — to be $14.8 billion, according to Bloomberg. Notably, research and development costs rose to $2.8 billion from $2.1 billion in the same quarter a year ago, stoking fears that efforts Google executives like to call “moonshots” — like investing in a private rocket company — are adding to expenses with no hope of a financial return in the near future.The report comes at a rough time for Google’s stock. Shares in the company, as of Thursday morning, were down about 10 percent since April 2014, a period in which the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index has increased and peers like Facebook have rallied 25 percent. Google shares were up a little more than 1 percent in after-hours trading after the results were announced.\\n\\n\\n\\nChinese government seems to back down on report criticized Alibaba: Hovering over the results was a white paper about Alibaba issued on Wednesday by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, or S.A.I.C., a Chinese regulator. The letter said the agency had discovered “the long-term existence of illegal problems regarding the management of transaction activity and other issues.” The agency said that it presented findings to Alibaba executives in a July 17 meeting at the company’s headquarters in the eastern city of Hangzhou, but that it had kept the results confidential at the time so as “not to affect Alibaba’s preparations for a stock market listing.” Alibaba began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in September. Though the end result of the S.A.I.C. investigation is not yet clear, by Thursday afternoon Alibaba appeared to have scored a victory against the regulator when the white paper was removed from the agency’s website without explanation. In New York trading on Thursday, the company’s shares closed more than 8 percent lower.\\n\\n\\nMore Alibaba Stats: GMV Taobao marketplace reached RMB 494 billion (US$79.3 billion) in gross merchandise volume (GMV), That’s up 43 percent from the same period in 2013. Sister site Tmall hit RMB 293 billion (US$47 billion) in GMV, up 60 percent from 12 months ago. In total, Alibaba’s China estores saw RMB 787 billion (US$126.4 billion) in spending (GMV) in Q4, which is up 49 percent from the same period a year before. Annual active buyers on Taobao and Tmall grew to 334 million, up from 231 million the year before. Mobile GMV rocketed to RMB 327 billion (US$53 billion) in Q4, up 213 percent annually. Mobile GMV accounted for 42 percent of total GMV in Q4 2014, compared to 20 percent in Q4 2013. Mobile monthly active users (MAUs) grew to 265 million, which nearly doubled from the 136 million figure 12 months prior.\\n\\n\\nAWS results will be broken out separately going forward; AWS will continue to dominate capex: One question investors always have about Amazon will soon be solved. The company said it would start breaking out numbers for its cloud computing platform, AWS, after the current quarter. AWS is growing much faster than Amazon as a whole, although price wars with other leading players are presumably cutting into profitability. Revenue in the “other” category, which is dominated by AWS, was $1.74 billion in the fourth quarter, up 41 percent.\\xa0AWS is likely Amazon\\'s most profitable division, some opine: Still, the shift is a good sign for investors, who have been clamoring for Amazon to disclose more about its fastest-growing and likely most profitable division that some analysts say accounts for 4 percent of total sales. The change seemed unlikely until AWS made up 10 percent of Amazon\\'s net sales, the threshold at which U.S. securities regulators require disclosure. Szkutak also added that a large portion of Amazon\\'s capital expenditure will go toward AWS, which has stepped up its efforts to win over lucrative contracts with large, corporate clients.\\n\\n\\nWorryingly the gap between Amazon’s growth rate and that of the North American e-commerce industry narrowed to a sliver last year. The Seattle-based company’s growth is decelerating even as Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos invests in speedier delivery and gadgets. In 2014, Amazon’s sales in North America -- its biggest region by revenue -- rose 23 percent, compared with 16 percent for the e-commerce market in the U.S. and Canada, according to researcher EMarketer Inc. The seven percentage point difference is the smallest since at least 2009, the earliest that EMarketer started keeping track of such data. In 2011, Amazon’s North American sales grew at 41 percent, about 2.5 times the 17 percent pace of the e-commerce market. The diminishing gap highlights just how much Amazon’s once breakneck pace of growth has slowed. The online retailer is confronting challenges, including a large size that makes moving the needle on sales more difficult, as well as more competitors stepping up their online efforts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn an unusual move, a Chinese government agency slammed Alibaba, sending its stock down 4%: Alibaba hit back, personally criticizing a government official. More coverage here: In unusually blunt criticism, a Chinese government agency on Wednesday took aim at the e-commerce giant Alibaba Group for what it said were unlicensed merchants, fake goods and other illegal practices on its hugely popular shopping websites. The news sent Alibaba’s shares down more than 4 percent in New York China’s main corporate regulator, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, released a report summarizing its findings of the deficiencies on Alibaba’s sites, including Taobao Marketplace and Tmall.com. In a statement on its website, the regulator said that after a thorough review, it had discovered “the long-term existence of illegal problems regarding the management of transaction activity and other issues.” The agency said that it had presented the findings to unidentified top Alibaba executives in a July 17 meeting at the company’s headquarters in the eastern city of Hangzhou, but that it had kept the results confidential at the time so as “not to affect Alibaba’s preparations for a stock market listing.” Alibaba went on to raise a record $25 billion in September in an initial public offering in New York. The regulator’s report, first made public on Wednesday, said it had found 19 problems in five main areas on Alibaba’s sites. Those included a number of unlicensed or unregistered vendors selling items, including knockoffs and goods that were improperly imported or banned from sale in China. Such items included fake cigarettes, wine and mobile phones; knockoff handbags; gambling equipment; wiretapping devices; and restricted types of knives. In a response on its verified account on the social messaging service Weibo, Taobao on Wednesday said that it had been a victim of fakes and had gone to great lengths to prevent them from being sold on its site. At the same time, the company took issue with the regulator’s approach, saying that it “welcomes fair and just supervision” but that the agency had not been objective. Taobao went further still, and in a rarely seen public criticism of a government official, it accused Liu Hongliang, a bureau chief at the administration for industry and commerce, of using inappropriate procedures in carrying out his investigation. The company said it would file a formal complaint to the agency.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Secure and controllable\": Chinese rules on technology have significant and worrying implications for technology firms: China will force companies which sell computer equipment to banks to hand over secret source code, undergo sensitive audits and set up research and development centers in the country, the New York Times reported on Thursday. Beijing wants 75 percent of technology products used by China\\'s financial institutions \"secure and controllable\" by 2019, the paper reported, citing an official document expected to be circulated to businesses in the next few months. The new rules have aggravated concerns among foreign companies that Chinese authorities are trying to force them out of the country, the Times said. Approved by authorities late last year, the rules do not specify what is meant by \"secure and controllable\", the paper added. Source code - the usually tightly guarded commands that create programs - for most computing and networking equipment would have to be turned over to officials, according to the incoming regulations. Firms planning to sell computer equipment to Chinese banks would have to set up research and development centers in the country, get permits for workers servicing technology equipment and build \"ports\" which enable Chinese officials to manage and monitor data processed by their hardware. It quoted a letter sent on Wednesday to a top-level Communist Party committee on cybersecurity from foreign business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, accusing them of protectionism.\\n\\n\\nFacebook earnings: Q4 revenue $3.85B, +49% Y/Y; net income $701M, +34% Y/Y; sharply higher expenses send stock down 2%:\\xa0When Mark Zuckerberg warned investors three months ago that Facebook’s expenses were going to rise sharply, he really meant it. The company reported on Wednesday that revenue increased 49 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the previous year, exceeding Wall Street’s expectations. But expenses rose even faster, up 87 percent from the same quarter a year ago, driven in part by a huge increase in stock payouts to employees. The social network, which makes most of its money by including advertising in the news feeds of its users, said about 69 percent of its advertising revenue came from mobile devices, which have become the most common way people tap into the service. Facebook reported that it had 1.39 billion monthly users worldwide in December, up 3.2 percent from September. Facebook said that it had revenue of $3.85 billion in the fourth quarter, compared to $2.59 billion a year ago. Net income was $701 million, or 25 cents a share, up from $523 million, or 20 cents a share, in the previous fourth quarter. After excluding certain expenses, the company’s profit was 54 cents a share. On that adjusted basis, Wall Street had expected the company to earn 49 cents a share on revenue of $3.77 billion. Facebook’s share price was down about 2 percent in after-hours trading after the results were announced. The stock is up more than 40 percent over the last year. The company said it brought in an average of $9 in revenue per American and Canadian user during the quarter. European and Asian users are much less lucrative, while newer areas of focus for the company, like Africa, bring in virtually no revenue. Over all, the average Facebook user was worth $2.81 to the company in the quarter. Video, which Facebook began highlighting last summer, was particularly strong in the quarter, the company said, with users viewing three billion videos a day. Ms. Sandberg said the company still anticipated huge opportunities to sell more ads, and was investing heavily in measurement technology to prove to advertisers that the platform delivers results. At the same time, Facebook is in no rush to make money from the separate services it owns, including Instagram, a photo-sharing service which has 300 million users, and WhatsApp, which has 700 million.\\n\\n\\nFacebook ad targeting has led to spectacular monetization improvements in the US and Europe: Facebook’s been a quest to improve its ad measurement, and it’s definitely paying off. In Q4 2014, Facebook’s user count in the US & Canada only grew by a tiny 0.97% from 204 million to 206 million, but the average ad revenue it earns from each of those users grew 24% from $6.64 to $8.26. It means that through better ad targeting to connect customers to the brands they’re likely to buy from, and improved online and offline sales measurement to track those purchases, it’s been able to grow ad revenue about 25X faster than user count. That’s not just in North America. In Europe, average ad revenue per user was up 21% on just 1.3% user growth. Now the question is whether can figure out how to do the same in the developing world. In the “Rest Of World” region that includes many developing nations in Africa and South America, user count grew 3% from 423 million to 436 million users, yet average ad revenue per user there only grew 12% from $0.82 to $0.92. That’s strong, but not like it is in the US and Canada.\\n\\n\\nFacebook video is on fire:\\xa0Facebook Now Has Over 3B Video Views Per Day: If it’s starting to feel like every visit you make to Facebook these days is full of videos, you are not alone. Facebook today reported in a strong set of Q4 earnings that there are 3 billion videos viewed on its site each day. With the company also reporting daily active users of 890 million, this works out to more than 3 videos per day. Facebook more specifically later noted that over 50% of people in the US who come to Facebook daily watch at least one video per day. It doesn’t break out how many of those are auto-played but did noted that over 65% of Facebook video views occur on mobile. CEO Mark Zuckerberg pointed out in the call that while usage of Facebook has shifted over the last ten years, from primarily text through to “primarily photos with some text and video,” he may be understating things a bit. As a point of comparison, he noted that there are 2 billion photos each day shared across Facebook sites — or, put another way, 1 billion less photos than videos posted to Facebook daily. And as a sign of just how much Facebook is pushing video growth, it was only in June 2014 that the company passed 1 billion video views per day. Facebook said that in the last year, the number of video posts per person on Facebook increased 75% globally and 94% in the U.S. Facebook reported $3.6 billion in advertising sales on overall revenues of $3.85 billion but did not break out how much of that came from video advertising versus other formats.\\n\\n\\nAmazon Web Services on Wednesday announced Amazon WorkMail, an email service that adds a new front to the fierce competition in the cloud. WorkMail, which works behind existing interfaces like Microsoft Outlook, is being promoted as safer and cheaper than other systems. “Customers have repeatedly asked us for a business email and calendaring service that is more cost-effective and simpler to manage than their on-premises solution, more secure than the cloud-based offerings available today, and that is backed by the same best-in-class infrastructure platform on which they’re reliably running so many of their current (and future) workloads,” said Peter De Santis, vice president of AWS Compute Services, said in a news release. More here: Amazon.com accelerated its efforts to win over corporate clients on Wednesday by announcing an email and scheduling service that will compete with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Google Inc (GOOGL.O). The service, dubbed WorkMail, will launch in the second quarter and has been developed by the company\\'s cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It highlights Amazon\\'s efforts to convince deep-pocketed companies, called enterprises in tech parlance, to shift more of their work to AWS. Launching an email and scheduling service is likely the first step toward a broader suite of Amazon tools to gain corporate clients, analysts said. For example, Google\\'s Gmail offers many other services beyond email and calendars including file-sharing and video conferencing. AWS has spent the last couple of years trying to get corporate clients on board because big businesses spend more on data centers than startups, who were the initial focus of its business. But there are concerns that Amazon is spreading itself too thin, given its other sizeable investments in areas like Hollywood-style production and consumer devices. \"Email is a Trojan Horse into the enterprise,\" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said. He added that email is a $1 billion opportunity for Amazon given the popularity of AWS and Amazon\\'s willingness to sacrifice margins for volume.\\n\\n\\nSamsung Electronics reported its lowest annual profit since 2011 as its smartphone sales continue to suffer from increasing competition. In 2014, the company’s profit was 25 trillion won, a 32 percent drop from a high of 36.8 trillion won in 2013. Its 4Q2014 net profit fell 27 percent to 5.3 trillion won year-over-year, in-line with Samsung’s earning guidance earlier this month. The Korean tech giant reported that its mobile unit’s earnings dropped 64 percent year-over-year to 1.96 trillion won, marketing its fifth quarterly decline in a row. Mobile sales accounted for just 58 percent of Samsung’s total operating profit last year, a significant decrease from 70 percent in 2013. The company said smartphone shipments fell in 4Q2014 and will continue to decline this quarter. Samsung’s semiconductor business helped buoy up its profits, even though it didn’t make up for shortfalls in its mobile unit’s performance. The unit posted 4Q2014 operating profit of 5.3 trillion won and said its performance will continue to improve as more smartphone and tablet manufacturers order chips from Samsung, especially for high-end devices. The performance of Samsung’s mobile unit stands in contrast to its arch-rival Apple, which yesterday reported that it had sold a record-breaking 74.5 million iPhones during the first quarter of its fiscal 2015 year. Apple gained ground thanks to the popularity of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, especially in China, where it competes with Samsung as well as domestic smartphone makers like Xiaomi and Lenovo. In fact, research firm Canalys reported that Apple topped smartphone shipments in China for the first time last quarter. This means that Samsung is now in third place, behind Apple and Xiaomi.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple\\xa0Earnings: revenue $74.6B +30% Y/Y, profit $18B: Apple Just Had The Most Profitable Quarter Of Any\\xa0Company Ever:  Apple quarterly results smashed Wall Street expectations with record sales of big-screen iPhones in the holiday shopping season and a 70 percent rise in China sales, powering the company to the largest profit in corporate history. The company sold 74.5 million iPhones in its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 27, while many analysts had expected fewer than 70 million. Revenue rose to $74.6 billion from $57.6 billion a year earlier. Profit of $18 billion was the biggest ever reported by a public company, worldwide, according to S&P analyst Howard Silverblatt. Apple\\'s cash pile is now $178 billion, enough to buy IBM (IBM.N) or the equivalent to $556 for every American. Apple\\'s cash pile is now $178 billion, enough to buy IBM (IBM.N) or the equivalent to $556 for every American. Shares rose about 5 percent to $114.90 in after-hours trade.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Pay is “doing exceptionally well,” Steve Weinstein, an analyst at ITG Investment Research Inc., said in an interview before the earnings. “Once somebody uses it, it becomes a little over 5 percent of transactions that they were doing. It’s a lot. It’s really surprising, because you can’t even use Apple Pay in that many locations.” Twenty percent to 30 percent of people who buy the new iPhones activate Apple Pay, Weinstein said. A smaller percentage uses the service regularly. “It seems that Apple Pay was a motivating factor for people buying the iPhone,” Nick Holland, an analyst at financial-services consultant Javelin Strategy & Research, said in an interview. A “double-digit” percentage of about 2,000 consumers Javelin surveyed last year after the service debuted said Apple Pay was part of the reason for their decision to buy a new Apple device.\\n\\n\\nApple is now the No. 1 smartphone maker in CHina: Apple is famous for setting trends. In China, though, Apple has found success by following one. For years, Apple rivals like Samsung offered large-screen smartphones. Although the bigger phones sold well in China, Apple held off on releasing a similar model, and the country remained a weak spot. But Apple introduced its own versions last September, and now the sales spigot is wide open. The company on Tuesday reported $16.1 billion in revenue from “greater China” — which includes mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan — in its first fiscal quarter, up 70 percent from the same period a year ago. Canalys, a research firm, estimates that Apple is now the No. 1 smartphone maker in China. The success in China helped push Apple to a blockbuster first quarter, increasing overall profit to $18 billion and revenue to $74.6 billion. In the same quarter a year ago, the company had profit of $13.1 billion and revenue of $57.6 billion.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nApple is increasingly reliant on the iPhone however, as Macs and iPads become less important: Overall sales of iPhones shattered analysts’ predictions. Apple said it sold 74.5 million iPhones in the quarter, as many as 12 million more than expected. The company’s overall revenue, almost $75 billion, easily beat analysts’ average estimates of $67.7 billion, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters. The company’s shares, which have gained more than 50 percent in the last year, rose more than 5 percent in after-hours trading. Strong sales of Macs also contributed to the company’s growth. The company said it sold 5.5 million of the computers in the quarter, up from 4.8 million in the same quarter of last year. But iPad sales continued to shrink. The company sold 21.4 million iPads in the quarter, down 18 percent from 26 million in the quarter a year ago. Increasingly, though, the company’s fortunes rely on the iPhone. Sales of iPhones accounted for 69 percent of the company’s revenue in the quarter, up from 56 percent in the same quarter a year ago. “A bet on Apple is increasingly a bet on the iPhone,” said Toni Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. “The good news is, iPhones are great. The bad news is, right now that’s driving over 100 percent of the revenue growth of the company.” \\n\\n\\nApple is getting consumers to pay more for phones even as industry trends move in the other direction: Apple\\'s sales figures are all the more impressive because they come at a time when the worldwide market for expensive smartphones is dropping. According to research from the Consumer Electronics Association, the average selling price of a smartphone has fallen from $440 to an expected $275 in just five years. The full price of the cheapest iPhone is $649. In fact, the average price of an iPhone actually went up, thanks to the popularity of the iPhone 6 Plus, which starts at $749. That\\'s right; Apple\\'s actually getting us to pay more for our phones. (Of course, most are purchased at subsidized prices through wireless carriers).\\n\\n\\nYahoo reports weak earnings (revenue $1.18B, -1.8% Y/Y), but tax-efficient spin-off of Alibaba stake sends shares up 7% despite weakness in the rump of Yahoo: Marissa Mayer, chief executive of Yahoo, said on Tuesday that the Internet company would spin off its 15.4 percent stake in Alibaba, China’s leading e-commerce company, into a separate company. The decision, which Wall Street has been waiting for since Ms. Mayer joined the company in 2012, cheered shareholders because they will directly reap all the remaining profit from Yahoo’s prescient investment, which cost almost nothing a decade ago but is now worth about $39.5 billion. In the process, Yahoo will avoid any taxes on the transaction but will be stripped of its single most valuable asset. The Alibaba stake alone now makes up nearly 85 percent of Yahoo’s market value. Ms. Mayer delivered a report card on her turnaround plan on Tuesday, noting that overall revenue and profit fell in the fourth quarter. But the company’s mobile businesses, as well as other newer initiatives, like so-called native ads, showed rapid growth. Still, the immediate reaction to the Alibaba announcement was positive, with investors driving Yahoo’s stock up about 7 percent in after-hours trading after disclosure of the plan. Yahoo reported revenue of $1.25 billion and adjusted profit of 30 cents a share in the quarter, slightly exceeding Wall Street’s expectations. Analysts had on average expected the company to report revenue of $1.18 billion and adjusted earnings of 29 cents a share, according to data collected by S&P Capital IQ. The company’s net income was $166 million, or 17 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with $348 million, or 33 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago. Yahoo sold a hefty chunk of its stake in Alibaba in September when the Chinese company sold shares in an initial public offering. Yahoo had a $10.3 billion gain from the sale, but nearly 40 percent of that was eaten up by taxes. Yahoo executives promised shareholders that they would find a way to dispose of the rest of the Alibaba stake in a way that incurred a much lower tax bill. Their solution — a spinoff of the Alibaba stake and a Yahoo operating business — avoids $16 billion in corporate taxes that Yahoo would have owed if it had simply sold the stake, executives said. Investors will receive shares in the spun-off company in proportion to their stakes in Yahoo, and will pay taxes on their capital gains when they sell those shares. But the plan will not give Yahoo a new pile of cash with which it could make big acquisitions. The spinoff is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter.\\n\\n\\nRemarketing goes offline with beacon technology: By now you\\'ve probably heard of \"beacons,\" and how they allow advertisers to send targeted messages and offers to shoppers\\' smartphones as soon as they enter a physical store. Today a deal has been struck which is about to make beacons a whole lot more interesting - and useful - for advertisers for when the shopper steps out of that store. Norway-based startup media platform and ad server Unacast and California-based Total Communicator Solutions (a company that specializes in location-based marketing and claims to have more beacon installations than any other company. It counts P&G among its clients.) have today announced a global partnership to launch what they claim is an industry first: The ability for brands to \"re-target\" online and mobile ads to shoppers based on the actual items they have been looking at in-store. Here\\'s how it will work: A shopper with a retailer\\'s app installed on their phone and Bluetooth turned on walks into a shoe store. If they\\'ve opted in for beacon messages, they\\'re greeted with a personalized message on their phone\\'s display. They walk over to the men\\'s shoe department and are then served with a new message about the new line of designer brogues that have just arrived in-store. And here\\'s the new bit: A day, a week, or a month later when that same customer goes online to have a look at a YouTube video. They are served a pre-roll video ad for that very same brand of brogues they were looking at in-store. They check the headlines on a newspaper website: Again, the very same shoes he was looking at appear in an ad, which says they\\'re available to buy now. That\\'s huge. Until now, the utility of beacons has been limited to allowing retailers and brands to communicate with shoppers whilst they are in the store. Now beacons are acting as the data collector to inform post-shopping ad campaigns. Unacast is looking to sign up more beacon companies (known as proximity solution providers/PSPs) to create a global network to anonymously group and standardize beacon data to allow advertisers and retailers to retarget consumers online, based on their offline interactions.\\n\\n\\nTwitter adds video, group messaging features: Twitter on Tuesday introduced a feature that lets you record up to 30 seconds of video to share on its micro-blogging site. You can shoot, edit and share video from within the app. The feature complements Twitter\\'s Vine video app, which lets users make looping six-second clips to share. The social network also announced that users will be able to send direct messages to more than one person at a time, making it more useful for setting up dinner plans or group movie dates without letting the whole world know about it. The features are rolling out to all users over the next few weeks, the company said in an official blog post. Both moves better position Twitter to take on the growing number of messaging apps that let users communicate privately -- one of the most popular app categories on the market right now. They also follow a number of product improvements in recent months that are aimed at attracting an audience beyond the super-plugged-in, constantly updating crowd that it has right now. For example, last week the company introduced a \"while you were away\" digest-like feature that offers summaries of messages users may have missed while not logged on to Twitter. The practical features are being called the brainchildren of Twitter\\'s new product manager, Kevin Weil, who was appointed in October with the mandate to give Twitter a wider appeal in the face of new social competitors such as WhatsApp and Snapchat.\\n\\n\\nFacebook and Instagram were inaccessible for about an hour Tuesday, but cause was an internal malfunction rather than a cyberattack. Facebook users began reporting problems in gaining access to the social media site on Tuesday morning, Hong Kong time. On Twitter, users posted images of an error message from Facebook that read: ‘‘Sorry, something went wrong. We’re working on it and we’ll get it fixed as soon as we can.’’ Both Facebook’s mobile application and its website were inaccessible. Facebook owns Instagram. ‘‘Earlier this evening many people had trouble accessing Facebook and Instagram,’’ Facebook said from its California headquarters. ‘‘This was not the result of a third party attack but instead occurred after we introduced a change that affected our configuration systems. We moved quickly to fix the problem, and both services are back to 100 percent for everyone.’’\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft Q4 earnings: revenue $26.5B, +8% Y/Y, profit $5.86B, shares fell 3% on earnings miss:\\xa0(more coverage\\xa0here,\\xa0here\\xa0and\\xa0here):\\xa0Microsoft reported profit of $5.86 billion, or 71 cents per share for the latest quarter, compared with $6.56 billion, or 78 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Sales rose 8 percent to $26.47 billion, largely due to the acquisition of Nokia\\'s phone handset business last year. Analysts had expected revenue of $26.3 billion and earnings of 71 cents per share, on average, including some restructuring costs. Shares of the world\\'s largest software company, which have surged to 14 year highs in the past few months, fell 3 percent in after-hours trading, to $45.63. The company ended the quarter with $90.25 billion in cash and equivalents. According to Microsoft, its commercial cloud revenue grew 114 percent compared to the year-ago period. In the sequentially preceding quarter, the company noted a 128 percent rise. It ended the current quarter on a $5.5 billion run rate. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLong overshadowed by its rival Alibaba, JD has emerged as China’s other online goliath by carving out its own distinct identity: While Alibaba’s marketplace serves as a platform to connect buyers and sellers, JD buys goods from manufacturers and distributors and holds the inventory in its own warehouses, in a model that echoes Amazon’s. It then arranges for quick delivery of virtually everything from television sets and refrigerators to socks and T-shirts, using motorbikes that weave in and out of traffic in some of the country’s biggest cities. Like Amazon, JD has invested heavily in infrastructure, pumping more than $1.5 billion into building and leasing warehouses and order-fulfillment centers around China. But JD has gone even further, venturing into home delivery with its own fleet of trucks and more than 20,000 couriers, all in the hope of capturing what is projected to be a $1 trillion Chinese e-commerce market by 2020. JD, which is publicly traded in the United States, is now China’s biggest direct-sales retailer, with 46 million active users and an estimated $20 billion in revenue last year. “This isn’t a business model for everyone, but they were smart to build it,” said Elinor Leung, a Hong Kong-based Internet analyst at CLSA, an investment bank. “Now, their traffic is exploding.” And yet this costly approach to building an online retailer has worried some analysts, who say that JD could be weighed down by its physical assets and mounting debt. Several analysts say the company won’t turn a profit before 2017. Competitors like Jack Ma, chairman of Alibaba, have even disparaged the company’s business model, calling it tragically flawed. “It’s not that we are better,” Mr. Ma said in a recently published interview. “It’s an issue of direction. So, I tell my people: Definitely do not get involved with JD.com. Don’t come blaming us if you die one day.” He later apologized for his comments. Executives at JD, which is based in Beijing, insist they are building a company that will eventually have a commanding advantage in e-commerce, with strong customer service, speedy delivery and assurances that the products it ships are authentic, not counterfeit. Among the biggest challenges now, they say, is keeping up with an enormous volume of online orders, which have doubled in each of the last three years. “If we wanted, we could be profitable right now,” said Shen Haoyu, chief executive of JD Mall, the company’s biggest division. “But our immediate goal is to grow our customer base.” the company boasts seven fulfillment centers and 118 warehouses in 39 cities. There are also 1,045 smaller pickup centers in about 500 cities. And since 2010, the company has pledged that most online orders placed before 11 at night will be delivered by 3 p.m. the next day. Morgan Stanley calls JD’s business model a combination of Amazon and UPS; other analysts say the company is beginning to look like Walmart, steeped in logistics and infrastructure and backed by a website.\\n\\n\\nVerizon’s mobile ‘supercookies’ show how telcos are monetizing user data:  Verizon is now at the forefront of telecommunications companies selling intelligence about their customers to advertisers. AT&T experimented last year with a similar ad-targeting program, which involved inserting a unique numeric code into a subscriber’s web requests. But after scrutiny in the news media, AT&T said it was halting its program, at least until it came up with a better approach. The ad-targeting experiments by Verizon and AT&T are striking examples of the data-mining opportunities open to phone carriers now that they have become the nexus of the information universe, providing a connection to the Internet for people anywhere they go, at any time. Verizon’s marketing efforts are part of a high-frequency digital ad trading system called real-time bidding, in which many kinds of players track and analyze users’ online activities to identify the characteristics of those who would be most receptive to certain ads. A Verizon service called Relevant Mobile Advertising, for instance, combines details obtained from information resellers like Acxiom and Experian with the wireless carrier’s own data to classify its mobile subscribers by gender, income, interests or other criteria; the company allows its subscribers to opt out of receiving ads customized through this program. Another service, called Verizon Selects — which consumers can opt in to in exchange for reward points — segments subscribers based on their web browsing and use of apps. Verizon says its customer categorization programs offer an advantage to advertisers because the company has a direct relationship with subscribers and it can understand their general location based on the places from which they make calls or send texts. The services use a unique alphanumeric code for each subscriber, rather than real names or contact information, to group them into ad clusters. Mr. Atreya, the Verizon director, says the company changes these customer codes every few days.\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft buys R startup Revolution Analytics to boost the data analytics offering of its cloud suite: Microsoft bought Revolution Analytics which makes tools to sift through data, to help the company build up its cloud-services business. Terms weren’t disclosed. The deal was driven by the growing volumes of data that companies are contending with and the need for more software that can help analyze the information, Microsoft said in a blog post on Friday. Revolution Analytics, based in Mountain View, California, makes a statistics programming language called R that helps analyze data. David Smith, chief community officer at Revolution Analytics, said in a blog post that the deal will spread the usage of advanced analytics within Microsoft products, including the Azure cloud service. Revolution Analytics counts financial companies such as American Century Investments and Northern Trust as customers, according to the company’s website. The R programming language is widely used by statisticians and scientists and has surged in popularity as people have turned to it to manipulate large pools of data. R was the world’s 18th most popular programming language in January, according to a study conducted by Tiobe Software, compared to 44th a year earlier. In a separate study, researcher RedMonk put R as the world’s 13th most popular programming language in January, up from 15th in 2014.\\n\\n\\nThe line between eCommerce and messaging is blurring, as messaging apps are increasingly becoming distribution and moneymaking platforms:  Developers have been expanding the uses of the apps, making new functions possible. And investors, seeing huge potential, have driven the apps to ever-higher valuations. “The most popular apps that sustain themselves day after day, month after month, at the top of the leader board, are messengers,” said Fred Wilson, managing partner at Union Square Ventures and an investor in Kik, a messaging app popular with young users. “That’s a reflection of what people do on their phones.” He added, “Once they become full-blown ‘portals’ for mobile content and mobile commerce, we will really see how massive this opportunity is.” The initial appeal of the apps is simple. They are faster to use than email, and they generally allow you to send text, links, video and photos to friends more cheaply than traditional texting services offered by wireless carriers like Verizon or AT&T. The uses are multiplying, though. On the app KakaoTalk, for example, people can discover other new smartphone apps and share them with their friends. On Snapchat, users can send money to one another inside the app. And Line, a messaging app popular in Japan, lets people pay for things at brick-and-mortar retail stores using Line Pay, the company’s payments service. Soon, media outlets like ESPN, Vice and CNN will be publishing original content directly to a new editorial section in Snapchat, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. “Media and communication are converging,” said Jonah Peretti, chief executive of BuzzFeed. “Some of what we’re all creating now will be a huge part of these messaging apps over the next one or two years.” Some of the most popular options are Viber, which says it has more than 200 million monthly visitors; Line, Japan’s most popular messaging app, with 170 million users; and WhatsApp, the leading service, which has more than 700 million regular visitors. For now, though, not all of the apps are generating big revenue. WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, reported just $10.2 million in sales in 2013. The revenue came from the small fraction of users who paid $1 to use the app. Still, the valuations of many messaging start-ups continue to rise. In February, Rakuten, the big Japanese online retailer, bought Viber for $900 million. The next month, the Chinese e-commerce behemoth the Alibaba Group led a $280 million investment in Tango, valuing the nearly six-year-old start-up at about $1 billion. Facebook paid $21.8 billion for WhatsApp in February. For investors, the thesis is a Silicon Valley adage: Get millions of people to use the service first, and eventually it will find a way to make money. Many entrepreneurs see WeChat, the hugely popular Chinese service run by the Internet giant Tencent, as the ideal model for building a business in messaging. Released four years ago, the app now claims nearly 500 million monthly active users — who not only send image-laden messages, but play games and book car rides and plane tickets. The rapid growth in messaging apps, some say, has been a response to the more public nature of popular apps like Twitter and Facebook, where status updates and posts are visible to the many rather than the few. “It’s a much more intimate experience,” said Marissa Campise, a partner at SoftBank Capital, the venture arm of Japanese telecom giant SoftBank. “Messaging apps are smaller and less visible than the public networks and far more engaged and trusted. It often feels like a more controlled, real-time replacement for email,” she said. Messaging users tend on average to pick up their phones several times an hour, Talmon Marco, the chief executive of Viber, noted in an interview late last year. That makes messaging apps an ideal place to introduce other offerings like games, virtual stickers or even physical goods. Asia has been a particularly fertile breeding ground for expanding the uses of the apps. In 2013, for example, WeChat joined Xiaomi, the Chinese smartphone giant, to offer a limited quantity of the company’s newest phone for purchase on the chat app. Users could reserve and then buy the new smartphone entirely inside the WeChat app using Tenpay, the payments service owned by Tencent. Xiaomi said it sold 150,000 phones in less than 10 minutes.\\n\\n\\nOnline Storage Company Box Has Strong Debut in First Day of Trading: Although questions had arisen about how Box’s initial public offering would fare, public investors gave the company a warm welcome on Friday, its first day of trading. Shares in Box, the online file storage company, opened at $20.20 on Friday morning, 44 percent higher than its I.P.O. price of $14 a share. The stock continued to surge to close the day at $23.23, up nearly 66 percent, giving the company a market value of $2.7 billion. At that level, the start-up has surpassed the $2.4 billion valuation that it fetched in its most recent private financing round last summer. Its strong first-day performance may ease some concerns among investors that highflying Silicon Valley start-ups were looking overvalued. Now that it has gone public, nearly a year after kicking off the process during a period of market upheaval, Box can focus on a more pressing issue: standing out in an industry that has quickly filled with competition, particularly from much bigger rivals like Google and Microsoft.\\n\\n\\nYahoo likely to announce plans to avoid huge tax hit on Alibaba windfall - two possible structures considered plausible: Yahoo on Tuesday is expected to reveal something most companies usually try to keep secret: how it plans to avoid a multibillion-dollar tax bill. The Web portal has spent more than a year figuring out how to cash out a chunk of its $40 billion stake in China-based Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Typically, a U.S. company faces a federal tax bill of about 35 percent when it sells stock in another enterprise for cash. Yahoo took a $3 billion tax hit last year when it sold about $10 billion in Alibaba shares. This time around, activist investors are leaning on the Sunnyvale, California-based company to be more savvy. Marissa Mayer, Yahoo’s chief executive officer, probably will maintain at least part of the Alibaba holding to keep a finger in China’s fast-growing Web market. Were Yahoo to sell the entire stake, it could face a federal tax bill of as much as $14 billion.Here are some of Yahoo’s options to avoid capital-gains tax, both legal: Option One: Last summer, John Malone’s Liberty Ventures wanted to avoid taxes on selling its stake in travel website TripAdvisor Inc. Liberty did so by transferring that stake, as well as online costume-retailer BuySeasons, to a new unit created specifically for the deal. Under the plan, the new unit took out a $400 million bank loan. Most of that cash was destined for Liberty and the new unit’s stock spun off to Liberty shareholders. The expectation was that TripAdvisor would acquire the new unit in exchange for the travel site’s own stock. TripAdvisor also agreed to repay the $400 million loan. When it’s all wrapped up, Liberty Ventures gets cash and exits TripAdvisor -- without incurring the tax bill a straight sale would trigger. Liberty’s shareholders get stock in TripAdvisor as though Liberty had distributed its holding in the site to its own investors. Liberty’s investors also don’t face taxes on the deal. In Yahoo’s case, it would spin off its stake into a new entity, which would borrow money and distribute the cash to the Internet company. “The tax savings sort of gets carved up between the two parties and they each get a chunk,” Option Two: Another option is to follow Warren Buffett’s lead, with what’s known in tax circles as the cash-rich split. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Graham Holdings Co. last March agreed to a deal that lets Buffett’s company unload its stake in the former Washington Post Co. while avoiding capital-gains tax. That deal called for Graham to transfer cash and a Miami television business -- combined, roughly equal to Berkshire Hathaway’s investment -- into a new subsidiary. Graham then shifts stock in that new unit to Berkshire Hathaway, while Buffett’s company moves its Graham stake back to the media company. Economically, it’s as though Berkshire Hathaway sold its Graham stake for cash -- and a TV station. But because the deal is structured as an exchange of shares, not a straight-up sale, it gets tax-free treatment. Were Yahoo to follow this route, it would exchange Alibaba shares for a stake in a new unit that would consist mostly of cash. Alibaba would have to shed some assets for Yahoo to get the advantage of such a deal; a cash-only transaction probably would trigger a tax bill. Accounting experts say it shouldn’t be difficult to find something to throw in the pot.\\n\\n\\nAs Alibaba and Chinese investors pour into Israel, the nation\\'s high-tech startups scored big exits in 2014: With nearly $15 billion in exits through mergers and acquisitions and public offerings, 2014 was an all-time record year for the Israeli hi-tech industry, compared with a mere $1.2 billion raised in 2013, according to a PwC report for 2014. The exits were spread out between a variety of tech industries, including Internet, IT, life sciences, communications and semiconductors. Semiconductors had a 38% of the share, but just one semiconductor IPO out of the 18 in total. The road accident avoidance technology developerMobilEye raised $1.023 billion in its August IPO, a record an Israeli company. As for new giant exits emerging, most argue that Israel’s hi-tech diversity is its strength. “While there seems to be a general hype around IoT, security and fintech, I find Israel to be a very unique place in the fact that entrepreneurs don’t tend to have group think and as such, we are seeing ventures tackling a very wide array of industries.” said Yaron Carni, the founder of two Israeli VC fundsMaverick Ventures and Tel Aviv Angel Group. And more international companies are beginning to take notice of Israel’s technological strengths. In fact, 2014 ended with a news item that might indicate China’s increasingly hefty presence in the Israeli hi-tech sector. Last year might be remembered as the time when Chinese technology companies embraced Israeli startups in a big way. On December 20, The Chinese eCommerce giant Alibaba invested in Visualead, a company that specializes in QR code generation. Based in Herzliya, the Israeli equivalent of Silicon Valley, the 15-person start-up was Aliababa’s first Israeli acquisition. Last September, China’s Yuanda Enterprise Group bought AutoAgronome, a maker of smart irrigation and fertilization systems for $20 million in order to move into high-tech agriculture.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon buys an Israeli chip startup for $350-370M; Annapurna Labs makes chips optimized for the cloud business:\\xa0(More coverage here and here)\\xa0Amazon agreed to acquire Israeli semiconductor company Annapurna Labs, seeking to improve performance within its Amazon Web Services cloud unit. A deal has been reached but hasn’t yet closed, said Mary Camarata, a spokeswoman at Amazon Web Services. She declined to comment on the terms. Acquisition talks were reported earlier by Israeli newspaper Calcalist, which said the purchase price could be as much as $370 million. Annapurna Labs develops microprocessors that allow fast data traffic for power-efficient computing and storage servers, according to the newspaper.  Seattle-based Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, is constantly seeking to improve the cost and performance of the equipment in its data centers and has been hiring more semiconductor engineers to add to its capabilities, James Hamilton, a vice president of Amazon Web Services, said in a November interview. The unit rents out computing power on its servers to businesses for access through the Web. \\n\\n\\nGoogle is gearing up to sell wireless service directly to customers as a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), by acquiring excess network capacity from Sprint and T-Mobile and reselling it to customers under its own brand. This is the same approach used by Cricket Wireless, MetroPCS, Pure Talk, Republic Wireless and many others in the U.S., but Google’s arrangement apparently required special consideration, according to The Wall Street Journal, given the potential threat network providers perceived in giving the search giant and Android maker too much control. Sprint built a volume clause into their agreement with Google, per WSJ, which triggers if the Google wireless service acquires a large number of users and lets Sprint renegotiate the terms of the deal. There’s no word on how T-Mobile’s arrangement works, but given comments about the U.S. carrier by its parent company Deutsche Telekom, the provider is probably looking for ways to shore up the sustainability of its prolonged “Uncarrier” campaign. More analysis here: What is Google planning? The company hasn\\'t confirmed anything, but reports suggest that Google wants to offer its own brand of cellular service by partnering with Sprint and T-Mobile, the nation\\'s third- and fourth-largest carriers, respectively. This means you\\'d buy minutes and data from Google, but it would all ride over the other two companies\\' pipes. Is this like Google Fiber for cellphones? Not quite. With Google Fiber, Google is connecting homes to high-speed fiber-optic infrastructure that, in many places, the search giant laid down itself. But in this case, it doesn\\'t appear that Google is building its own cell towers; it would simply resell Sprint and T-Mobile under the Google banner. Would this shake up the wireless industry? Google probably hopes so, but unlike the wired broadband industry that Google Fiber has been so successful at disrupting, the wireless industry is actually fairly competitive already. You have four major national carriers that are engaged in a major battle over pricing and customers right now. You also have dozens if not hundreds of smaller carriers who operate on the same basis as Google\\'s rumored plan — paying the national carriers a wholesale rate and then repackaging the service into a different product. These piggyback carriers are called MVNOs, short for mobile virtual network operators. Why would Google want to become a wireless provider? If there\\'s one thing driving Google, it\\'s a thirst for your commercial data. Think about all the data generated by your Google searches that gets scooped up and used for advertising. Now think about all the data you generate when you place a phone call: whom you\\'re calling, for how long, what time of day and so on. This information is incredibly personal and can be used to help build a profile of you — which, if you\\'ll recall, is partly why everyone was so outraged when they found out about the National Security Agency\\'s snooping into phone records. Then there\\'s the business information Google can collect about which data plans people find most attractive and how they use those plans. And naturally, all of Google\\'s handsets would likely run on Android, so there\\'s that software integration. \\n\\n\\nBox prices IPO - implied valuation of $1.6B, 33% discount to last funding as Box struggles to rise from storage play to platform play: (More here) Box Inc. is set to price its initial public offering at a discount to its latest financing round, as stiff competition overshadows the cloud-storage company’s plans to expand into new areas. The IPO comes almost a year after Box, which lets businesses manage, store and have access to data over the Web instead of through onsite computers, first filed to go public. The company’s financials in its March prospectus underwhelmed some investors just as deep-pocketed competitors including Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) were entering the fray, and the IPO was delayed. Ten months later, Box’s losses have narrowed as revenue surged 70 percent in the most recent quarter, and the company is offering new services that could help it retain and increase its customer base. The company, led by 29-year-old Aaron Levie, is still valuing itself below the level it fetched in a July private-financing round, betting the combination of its turnaround plan and cheaper price will lure buyers. “Investors are either going to have to buy into that story that they can diversify their business, or that this is coming cheap and that there will be consolidation,” said James Gellert, the president and chief executive officer of Rapid Ratings International Inc., which uses quantitative models to grade securities. Box, based in Los Altos, California, is seeking as much as $163 million from the IPO, scheduled to price Jan. 22. It is offering 12.5 million shares for $11 to $13 apiece, according to a Jan. 9 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Those terms indicate a valuation as high as $1.6 billion, reflecting a 33 percent discount to the $2.4 billion Box was valued at during a private round by investors including TPG Capital and Coatue Management LLC. The market for file sharing and synchronization software is forecast to grow 23 percent a year on average to $2.3 billion in 2018, market researcher IDC said in a report looking at 2013. The enterprise side of the market, where Box fits, is growing slightly faster at 27 percent a year. Box had 14 percent share in the overall market, behind Dropbox Inc. with 27 percent and Microsoft with 17 percent. The challenge for Box, said IDC’s Maureen Fleming, is that Microsoft has been dropping prices for its OneDrive and including it free for customers who are signing up to use its Office apps online. That means many corporate customers decide to at least try OneDrive, curbing Box’s growth rates. Fleming regards Box as superior to OneDrive for companies looking for cloud-based systems but said product quality doesn’t always matter to chief information officers in the market for software. In response to those price wars, Box has created ancillary services on top of storage to differentiate its offerings. They include programs to help companies to build custom applications as well as security features that can be customized. The company also has a consulting arm, which helps customers navigate its services. Said Eli Lilly CIO Mike Meadows: “They are doing the right things and saying the right things,But we haven’t come across the use case that would drive us using them in more of platform mode rather than just a storage mode.”\\n\\n\\nReddit\\'s Pick for New Ad Leader Shows the Site Is Getting Serious About Mobile Hires Zubair Jandali away from Google. The company hired Zubair Jandali from Google, who started this month as Reddit\\'s first vp of sales. Jandali had been with Google since 2009 when the company bought ad network AdMob, where he also worked. His hiring is yet another sign Reddit is serious about developing a mobile advertising presence. Reddit recently bought Alien Blue, the app that lets readers access Reddit on mobile, to hone a more sophisticated approach to smartphones and tablets. Alien Blue is Reddit\\'s first in-house app. Now, it has a vp of sales with experience in mobile advertising to go along with the product. \"Mobile is definitely one big area of investment for the company, so my background certainly plays into that,\" Jandali said in a phone interview this week. Reddit offers brands two ways to advertise on its site, which reaches 150 million people a month: banners and sponsored headlines. Headlines are the items that users and brands post to Reddit, and users can vote up or down on whether they like them. The user-submitted headlines that accumulate the most positive votes rise to a higher position on the page, but brands pay for top placement. There are over 8,000 \"active\" user-generated groups on the site called subreddits dedicated to different categories; they can attract fans of brands, movies, science fiction or just about any interest you can imagine. Advertisers can target a subreddit or buy ads on the front page of the site, which gets 50 million views a day, Jandali said. For instance, on Wednesday TBS promoted a headline on reddit.com at the top of the page for the show King of the Nerds. Jandali said visitors who click on sponsored headlines can spend up to five minutes in the posts. Jandali reports to CEO Ellen Pao, who took the role after a shake-up late last year that saw the exit of the former CEO and the return of co-founder Alexis Ohanian to board chairman. The ad sales teams are based in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.\\n\\n\\nTwitter pleads with power users not to use Instagram: Twitter appears to be sending out a message to a group of very high-profile users suggesting that these users post photos directly to Twitter instead of sharing through Instagram. Mashable secured a screenshot of the prompt, which shows the aesthetic differences between sharing an Instagram link and posting a photo directly through Twitter. In 2012, Instagram shut off Twitter Cards integration, meaning that the images would no longer appear in-line on the Twitter feed. Instead, Instagram photos shared out to Twitter would simply show as an Instagram.com link and push the user to the website for viewing. At the time, many people were upset that Instagram would interfere with the user experience for Twitter. It’s also worth noting that parent company Facebook has always displayed and still proudly shows Instagram images right in the feed. The original backlash over Instagram shutting down Twitter integration has long been forgotten, and in many ways, Instagram has won. In December, Instagram announced that it had surpassed 300 million active users, surging past Twitter’s 284 million active users. Twitter, which is older than Instagram, has struggled to keep up with the young gun in the media department. Twitter has released countless updates to the web product and the mobile apps to try to bring more attention to images and videos. It added a tab under user profiles to view media only, and put more focus on images that are used on profiles, like the addition of the Facebook-style header image and the now-larger profile photos. The company also added photo filters and editing tools long ago to deal with Instagram’s exodus from the feed in 2012. This latest message from Twitter to its mega-users, asking them to post photos from the app itself, only shows the severity of that struggle as consumers hungrily consume more and more multimedia content.\\n\\n\\nButton, a mobile start-up, looks to deep link apps with commerce: It took years for the web to become what it is today: a sprawling, interconnected network of sites endlessly linking back and forth to one another. It will likely take years for the same thing to happen to smartphone applications, which are mostly stuck in silos, disconnected from one another. One New York-based start-up believes it can help speed that process. “The mobile app world is so very fragmented that for users, it makes interactions between apps much more difficult than they should be,” said Michael Jaconi, chief executive of Button, which announced a $12 million round of venture financing on Thursday morning. “Our thesis is, can we connect the mobile economy in a smarter way?” Button’s value proposition is largely technical: The company wants to create the plumbing behind what’s known as deep-linking between apps that make sense to be connected. So for example, if a customer books a table at a restaurant using Resy, a restaurant reservation app, Button could suggest you book a ride to the restaurant using Uber, the ride-hailing service, and link the customer directly to the Uber app to request a ride. That connection may come with a commerce-based incentive — say, a $30 credit toward an Uber ride. Button makes its money based solely on the amount of traffic it drives to its app partners. The idea, Mr. Jaconi said, is similar to what Google did for search more than a decade ago. When a user wants to find something specific, they type in a search query and Google serves up a list of suggestions, along with a series of advertisements. Google has made billions capitalizing on what technologists call the moment of intent — that is, the exact time when a person wants to see a paid advertisement. Button believes it can pinpoint that moment of intent inside apps, a problem that Google has yet to crack. “The future, we think, is one where we’re no longer living in a world of typing, but rather in a world of taps,” Mr. Jaconi said. “Using your phone, we’ll be able to infer what you want to do next based on your location, the time of day, the context of the other apps you’re using.” “It’s increasingly difficult for app developers to rise above the noise and acquire users, and then re-engage these users over time,” said Chris Moore, a partner at Redpoint Ventures, a venture capital firm that led Button’s recent funding round. “Button enables a new channel for user acquisition and engagement.” Button is not the only company taking on deep app links. Facebook wants its deep-linking solution, announced last year, to become the standard for developers. And start-ups like Branch Metrics, URX and Quixey offer different approaches to the same problem as well.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",
      "(\"Onager's Daily Tech Snippets\", '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA big day for Microsoft, which unveiled lots more about Windows 10, a new browser named Spartan, and Windows Holographic, an augmented reality headset: the next generation of its operating system, including how it will work across mobile, tablet, desktop and other platforms. The biggest surprise was probably the new HoloLens augmented reality headset Microsoft created, and the Windows Holographic software it built to support said gadget: Microsoft Reveals Windows Holographic, An Augmented Reality User Interface For The World. Microsoft To Bring Xbox One Game Streaming to Windows 10 Devices Later This Year. Microsoft Previews Windows 10, Unveils New Internet Browser: Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), seeking to use the next version of its Windows software to win back consumers and keep business customers happy, gave a detailed look at the new operating system and took the wraps off a revamped Web browser. At an event Wednesday to preview Windows 10, the new iteration of its flagship personal-computer software, Microsoft showed the browser that will succeed Internet Explorer, code-named Project Spartan. The update to Windows, coming later this year, will also bring Cortana, the voice-activated digital assistant, to PC desktops, and will have touch-enabled Office applications such as Word and Excel built-in for smartphones and tablets. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, who took the helm almost a year ago, is trying to resuscitate Windows even as mobile computing continues to surge, PC demand sputters, and Microsoft focuses on versions of its Office applications for rival software platforms. He’s also tasked with overhauling the product little more than two years after the last update -- Windows 8 -- failed to jump-start consumer demand while alienating corporate customers. Microsoft also announced Windows Holographic, and a headset with glasses called HoloLens that will enable users to see holograms while tracking a user’s voice, motion and surroundings. The glasses will be available “in the Windows 10 timeframe,” said Alex Kipman, a technical fellow in Microsoft’s operating system group. The company also showed HoloStudio, software tools for creating holograms, 3-D printing them and sharing them. The new browser showed today lets users annotate websites using a stylus and touch or mouse and keyboard, and then send and share comments through e-mail and social media. The company also announced a new device called the Surface Hub, an 84-inch touch-screen computer designed for workplace collaboration that will run Windows 10.\\n\\n\\nUber closes $1.6 Billion in convertible debt that incentivize Uber to IPO in less than 4 years; also in talks to raise $600M in Series E; valuation at $41.2B: Uber, the popular ride-hailing start-up, has closed $1.6 billion in financing from clients of Goldman Sachs’s private wealth arm, the investment bank confirmed on Wednesday. The new round of financing comes just months after the company raised $1.2 billion from big institutions. Including that investment, the company is valued at some $41.2 billion, one of the richest-ever valuations for a private start-up. Moreover, Uber may still raise an additional $600 million in stock from hedge funds and strategic overseas investors, according to two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are ongoing. The funding adds to Uber’s already overflowing war chest; to date, the company has raised upward of $4 billion. With the new cash, Uber has more incentive to take on a new life as a publicly traded company. The securities sold to Goldman’s clients — in what was one of the biggest-ever sales of convertible debt — can be converted into shares in the start-up once it begins trading on a stock exchange, at a discount of 20 percent to 30 percent of the price set in an initial public offering, people briefed on the matter have said. Should the company not stage an I.P.O. within four years, however, the interest rate on those securities will rise.\\n\\n\\nVessel, a YouTube competitor launched by ex-Hulu execs went live to the public today; several big brands have signed on, and terms are more favorable to content producers than YouTube\\'s: Vessel, the much-awaited online video startup founded by ex Hulu executives Jason Kilar and Richard Tom, finally opened its service to the public today. It may take time to see if users are willing to pay to watch Web videos that are usually free, but the company says brands like Chevy, Corona Extra, Land Rover and Jaguar, as well as Unilever\\'s Axe, Dove, Suave and St. Ives, have signed up as advertisers. Kilar wrote in a blog post that Vessel is now welcoming sign-ups for an invite-only beta version of its service. To access content, users can choose to pay $2.99 per month or watch ad-supported videos. Vessel ads come in two forms: Five-second pre-rolls or interstitial units, which appear as branded \"motion posters.\" The latter pops up as users scroll through the site.  The platform offers creators a more favorable revenue share than YouTube, which splits ad revenue 45/55 in favor of the Google-owned video platform. Creators get 70 percent of all ad revenue made from their content on Vessel. Plus, the site earmarks 60 percent of its subscription revenue to divvy up among creators—if a creator\\'s videos make up 10 percent of platform views, he or she would get 10 percent of that allotment. A referral program also pays creators who attract new subscribers. (The company estimates that creators will make $50 per 1,000 views.) To qualify for the subscription-based revenue, creators agree to post new content on Vessel for at least 72 hours before offering it elsewhere for free. After the early access period, the content then moves to Vessel\\'s free, ad-supported service and can be posted on other non-subscription-based platforms.\\n\\n\\nEBay\\'s disappointing earnings: Q4 revenue $4.92B, Y/Y +9%, net income $936M, Y/Y +10%; will cut 2,400 positions and explore listing its warehousing & logistics unit:  EBay reported earnings of $936 million in the last quarter, a 10 percent increase from the same period a year ago. Overall revenue rose 9 percent, to $4.92 billion, nearly in line with analysts’ estimates of $4.93 billion. But other numbers foretell the reasoning behind the company’s drastic restructuring. EBay’s revenue growth in the company’s marketplaces division rose just 1.3 percent, to $2.3 billion, signaling the slowest growth of its auction sites in years. Mr. Swan said the company planned to reinvest in its marketing efforts to promote its auctions arm to encourage repeat business. It will also heavily promote PayPal and Braintree, the payments start-up eBay acquired in 2013, as competition from rivals like Apple, Google and other start-ups begins to heat up. Facing stiff competition and the declining growth of its auctions business, eBay announced a shake-up of the company on Wednesday, saying it planned to cut 2,400 positions, or 7 percent of its global work force. “It’s going to get a little bit worse before it gets better,” said Bob Swan, chief financial officer of eBay, citing declines of traffic and repeat customers in the company’s online auction business. “Our ecosystem has simply been disrupted.” The layoffs come in advance of a planned spinoff of PayPal, the company’s payments arm, set for later this year. EBay said it would also explore a sale or a possible initial public offering of eBay Enterprise, the company’s warehouse and logistics unit for third-party eBay sellers. eBay announced an agreement with activist investor Carl Icahn that will give investors a greater say in its PayPal payments unit once it is spun off and said it exploring a sale or public offering of its enterprise unit. The moves could lay the groundwork for a future acquisition of eBay and PayPal by companies looking to gain a foothold in the e-commerce and online payments markets. Wall Street analysts have identified Alibaba (BABA.N), Google (GOOGL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) as potential acquirers. EBay also said it plans to cut its workforce by 7 percent, or 2,400 jobs, in the current quarter. EBay shares were up 2.6 percent at $54.75 in after hours trade.\\n\\n\\nShazam, a smartphone app that identifies songs playing on TV/radio, raised $30M at ~$1B valuation: Shazam, a smartphone application that can identify songs, announced on Wednesday that it had raised $30 million in new funding round that valued the company at roughly $1 billion. The start-up, which was founded in London and has around 100 monthly million users worldwide, has been rumored to be moving toward an initial public offering. It is expected to join other fast-growing technology companies that have tapped the public markets in recent months. Shazam uses audio-recognition technology to allow people to identify songs by holding their smartphone or other mobile device next to a television or radio. The company’s technology typically identifies the song within seconds, and Shazam generates revenue from taking a percentage of sales from music found through its app and mobile advertising. As tech giants like Google and Amazon move aggressively into Shazam’s core music market, the company has reached a series of deals to expand its core business. Among them is an agreement with the Warner Music Group to create a label imprint for new artists who are discovered through Shazam. Shazam has also made deals with a number of brands and blue-chip advertisers allowing individuals to view additional content on cellphones or tablets about products when they use Shazam’s app with certain television commercials.\\n\\n\\nIndia internet/digital usage stats from a global report released by \\'We Are Social\\': Social marketing agency, We Are Social, released a whopping 376 page report on the latest digital numbers around the world. Here is a summary of the India stats: India has 242 million active internet users (China boasts of 642 million).75 percent of the population has mobile subscriptions, a total of 946 million.95 percent of the Indian mobile subscriptions are on prepaid plans. Only 11 percent of the mobile users have accessed 3G and 4G. A deeper look into the web traffic in the country reveals, 72 percent of all online activity in India is done on mobile, up by 9 percent rise from last year. Laptops and desktops account for 27 percent of the activity, a drop of 19 percent. India has 118 million active social media accounts, of which 100 million of which are mobile users. Facebook, Google Plus, and Twitter top the list as the most popular social networks in India. Interestingly, LinkedIn is more popular than Pinterest and Instagram. Also 14 percent of Indians shopped online via a PC, while 9 percent made purchases from a mobile phone last month.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNetflix Q4 revenue $1.3B (+35.7% Y/Y); net income beat,\\xa0profit outlook for 2017 sends shares up 16%: Netflix will\\xa0expand to 200 countries, raise $1B in debt to create original content:\\xa0Netflix Revenue rose 35.7 percent, to $1.3 billion, compared with the year-earlier period. Net income for the quarter was $83 million, or $1.35 a share, up from $48 million a year earlier, because of a benefit related to the resolution of a tax audit. Without that tax benefit, net income would have been $45 million, beating the forecast for $27 million. The company lost less money than it had expected in its international business and also benefited from other tax credits. The company said it had exceeded its forecast for total paid streaming subscribers. That number increased to 54.5 million in the quarter that ended Dec. 31, 2014, up 31.5 percent from the same period in 2013.  n the United States, Netflix had 39 million streaming members in the fourth quarter, a net addition of 1.9 million. In the year-earlier period, it added 2.3 million members. For the coming quarter, Netflix predicted that growth would slow further. Netflix is pouring resources into original productions. Investors sent the shares up as much as 16 percent after the Los Gatos, California-based company said it will profitably reach all 200 of the countries that have broadband Internet service within two years. “We then intend to generate material global profits from 2017 onwards,” Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings and his finance chief, David Wells, said today on the company’s website. The outlook reassured investors who have expressed concerns about the company’s narrow margins, widening international losses and a budget for films and TV shows that’s swollen to $9.5 billion from $7.3 billion in the past year. Netflix rose 15 percent to $404.01 in extended trading. It reached as high as $405.70 following fourth-quarter results that included better-than-predicted subscriber growth. The stock gained 3.4 percent to $348.80 at the close in New York. International subscriber growth outstripped gains in the U.S. for the third straight quarter, as Hastings raced to plant his flag before other would-be competitors. Users outside the U.S. expanded by a record 2.43 million in the fourth quarter, reaching 18.3 million. Fourth-quarter revenue rose 26 percent to $1.48 billion, compared with analysts’ predictions of $1.49 billion. Net income almost doubled to $83.4 million, or $1.35 cents a share, aided by a tax benefit, Netflix said on its website. Domestically, the company added 1.9 million new customers to reach 39.1 million, compared with the 1.85 million predicted. That brought the worldwide total to 57.4 million. This quarter, Netflix forecasts 1.8 million new U.S. customers. Profit will be $37 million, or 60 cents a share. To support its programming efforts, Netflix plans to borrow at least $1 billion. The company’s has committed to spending $9.5 billion on programming.\\n\\n\\nIBM misses on both topline and bottomline, posts 11th straight quarterly revenue declines, shares down 1.8%: International Business Machines Corp posted a new 2015 profit target and quarterly revenue that both missed analysts\\' estimates, as the one-time world technology leader continues to grapple with its journey from low-margin hardware maker to the new world of cloud computing.Shares of IBM, which is still the world\\'s largest technology services company, but no longer regarded as a leader in innovation, fell 1.8 percent to $154.05 in extended trading. It was the 11th straight quarter that the Armonk, New York-based company has reported falling quarterly revenue, including the effects of currency. It has seen shrinking revenue for three years now as it sheds low-profit businesses such as cash registers, low-end servers and semiconductors and tries to focus on emerging areas such as security software and cloud services. But the new businesses have so far failed to make up for revenue lost to divestitures. Annual revenue fell to $93 billion for 2014, from $107 billion in 2011. The company had no guarantee that it would not fall further. \"We\\'re not interested in revenue for revenue\\'s sake,\" IBM Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter told Reuters in a phone interview. \"We\\'ll continue to divest if something doesn\\'t fit the model.\" The struggle to make headway in the new Internet-based technology industry is shared by other longstanding giants. SAP SE, Europe\\'s largest software group, on Tuesday cut key profit forecasts and abandoned a target for higher margins. \"IBM as well as other tech stalwarts such as Oracle, SAP, HP and Cisco face major headwinds as they adjust to this new cloud paradigm shift, which coupled with a cloudy IT spending environment have negatively impacted results,\" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. IBM is in the midst of a challenging transition, and its fourth-quarter financial results reflected that reality. The technology giant on Tuesday reported quarterly declines in both sales and profits, though its earnings were above Wall Street’s diminished expectations. The company said net income in the quarter fell to $5.5 billion, down 11 percent from the same quarter a year ago. The company’s operating earnings declined to $5.81 a share, above the average estimate of analysts for $5.41 a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters. IBM’s revenue slid to $24.1 billion, well below the $27.7 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Its quarterly sales were somewhat below Wall Street’s consensus forecast of $24.8 billion. In after-hours trading, IBM’s stock price slipped $2.90 a share, or about 1.9 percent, to $154.05. The new businesses the company has earmarked for growth — data analytics, cloud, security and mobile apps for corporations — grew at a 16 percent rate in 2014 and contributed $25 billion in revenue, or 27 percent of the company’s total sales. These growth businesses, he said, should continue to expand at a double-digit rate. But analysts question how well IBM is doing in achieving its objectives. \\n\\n\\nTwitter\\'s makes first India acquisition, buys missed call startup Zipdial for $30-40M; gains a Bangalore office and a way to engage customers offline: Twitter acquired Indian startup Zipdial earlier today, signaling that the social network is doubling down on the fast changing Indian market. But the ramifications of the buy-out don’t stop there. What Zipdial does is give companies a way to engage with people without forcing consumers to make calls, send SMS, or go online. All people have to do is send a missed call to a specific number belonging to a brand or service, and that subscribes the individual to relevant updates. It’s a little bit like Twitter, except it works mostly offline. And now that Twitter owns Zipdial, that way of operating will be used by the social network in India and a lot more countries. “It can drive growth in other similar emerging markets, like Indonesia or Brazil,” says Rishi Jaitly, Twitter’s market director for India and Southeast Asia. While there are no specific plans yet, Jaitly explains to Tech in Asia that Zipdial has experience across Southeast Asia and Africa, so the know-how is ready to roll. What Zipdial offers Twitter, says Jaitly, is a way for people to “connect to digital content offline. Jaitly says those early experiments in conjunction with Zipdial worked well. Those allowed India’s phone users to make a missed call to follow certain celebrities on Twitter. This worked entirely offline, by receiving SMS updates, and didn’t require the individual to sign up to Twitter. “All kinds of people on all kinds of devices consumed content” through those projects, says Jaitly. “You can expect us to draw lessons from experiments with Zipdial and scale them up,” he adds. The acquisition – Twitter’s first in India, and which gives it a Bangalore office – leaves Twitter with a lot moves it can make in emerging markets, which also opens up new revenues streams from brands and media using this “missed call” service to engage with consumers. Although deal size was not disclosed, separate media reports pegged it at $30-40 million. ZipDial’s user experience combines SMS, voice, mobile web and access to mobile apps to bridge users from offline to online. The company’s core business model, though, was built on leveraging the ubiquitous behaviour of ‘missed calls’ between friends and applying them as an offline call-to-action for brand engagement. For example, through ZipDial, one can engage with a publisher or brand by making a toll-free ‘missed call’ to a designated phone number. The caller will then begin receiving inbound content and further engagement on his/her phone in real time through voice, SMS or an app notification. These interactions are especially appealing in areas where people aren’t always connected to data or only access data through intermittent Wi-Fi networks. Additionally, prepaid recharge or top-up (money added to a user’s prepaid mobile account) is considered as valuable as currency in emerging markets. That became a foundation for the company’s couponing and gratification products.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba is everywhere: invests in an Israeli QR code startup, and also seeks a stake in a giant state-owned Chinese insurance firm: QR Codes: Alibaba invests in Visualead, an Israeli startup that generates QR codes. Alibaba has announced it has helped raise a series B round in Israel’s Visualead, a startup that lets users generate visually appealing QR codes. The size of Alibaba’s investment remains undisclosed, but Visualead has previously raised US$2.4 million to according to CrunchBase. Visualead helps small business create QR codes that blend into images more seamlessly than standard black-and-white QR codes. Using the company’s web-based service, users can upload images, specify urls, and generate QR codes that mesh into the particular graphic. The company offers numerous tiers for individuals and enterprises based on the number of QR codes they hope to create. According to a release from Visualead, Alibaba will help its Taobao and Tmall vendors integrate Visualead into their marketing initiatives. The Chinese ecommerce giant has its own QR-code initiative, Mashangtao, which helps merchants create QR codes for any number of purposes like parcel tracking or marketing. Insurance: Alibaba is planning to buy shares in the state-run New China Life Insurance Shanghai Securities News said on Wednesday, citing unnamed sources. Alibaba is already invested in China\\'s insurance market. The founders of Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) were among a consortium of investors who purchased stakes in Ping An Insurance Group Co of China Ltd (2318.HK) (601318.SS) in a HK$36.5 billion ($4.7 billion) deal in December. New China Life Insurance has a market capitalisation of $24 billion and provides life insurance services and products. \\n\\n\\nAlibaba, Tencent and Baidu are starting to make increasingly similar investments and behave more and more alike: Before China became the biggest smartphone market, there was little overlap between the businesses of e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, social networking firm Tencent Holdings Ltd and search engine provider Baidu Inc. Now, as more and more Chinese use their phones for everything from shopping to booking restaurants, the three companies are increasingly stepping over each other - and investing in the same services - to attract the same users. In little over a month, taxi-hailing apps Didi Dache, supported by Tencent, and Alibaba-funded Kuaidi Dache raised over half a billion dollars each, while U.S. taxi app Uber attracted an undisclosed sum from Baidu. The next arena looks set to be group-buying services, where customers agree to buy a certain item or service at the same time to gain discounts. Baidu bought out Nuomi last year and Alibaba-backed Meituan on Monday said it raised $700 million, valuing the company at $7 billion.\\n\\n\\nRumors have it that Olacabs might be close to raising another $300-500M at $2B: Barely three months after Mumbai-based ANI Technologies Pvt Ltd, the company behind Olacabs, an online marketplace for cabs and car rental services, raised $210 million led by SoftBank, it is back in the market to scoop between $300-500 million more, sources privy to the development told Techcircle.in. “Ola has doubled in size in terms of revenue run rate since its last fundraise when it was valued at $1 billion. It is now seeking twice the valuation,” said one of the sources. The source added that it is likely to rope in at least two new investors including a New York-based fund besides a Hong Kong-based fund house, besides participation from most of its existing investors. “While one of the new investors is a hedge fund, the other is a PE investor,” he said. The proposed fundraising, which would be its Series E or fifth round of institutional funding, would strengthen its position as the most heavily funded player in its business. It would also make it the third most funded new generation tech venture behind Flipkart and Snapdeal. One97 which operates Paytm is in the final stage of scooping a large round. Olacabs had raised $210 million in its Series D round led by Japanese internet and telecom giant SoftBank. Previously, it raised Rs 250 crore ($41.8 million) in its Series C round of funding led by Hong Kong-based hedge fund manager Steadview Capital and Silicon Valley-based Sequoia Capital. Existing investors Matrix Partners India and Tiger Global Management also participated in this round. In November 2013, Olacabs had raised its Series B round of funding led by Matrix Partners India for a big minority stake, with participation from existing investor Tiger Global Management. Although the company had not disclosed the amount at the time, media reports pegged it at $20 million. Prior to that, it had raised Rs 19.2 crore ($3.2 million) from existing investor Tiger Global in July the same year, which was believed to be part of the same round. Back in 2012, the company had raised over $5 million in its Series A funding from Tiger Global. Prior to that, it had raised angel funding from a bunch of individual investors, including Rehan Yar Khan and Anupam Mittal. In the cab booking segment, Ola is seen as the biggest player competing with Google Ventures-backed global major Uber and domestic players such as TaxiForSure (backed by Accel Partners and Bessemer Venture Partners), Savaari, taxiGUIDE and Cabs24X7.\\n\\n\\nBig-data based lending story #1: Small startups attempt to use borrower profiling models that use behavioral signals to cut default rates on student loans, personal loans: When bankers of the future decide whether to make a loan, they may look to see if potential customers use only capital letters when filling out forms, or at the amount of time they spend online reading terms and conditions — and not so much at credit history. These signals about behavior — picked up by sophisticated software that can scan thousands of pieces of data about online and offline lives — are the focus of a handful of start-ups that are creating new models of lending. No single signal is definitive, but each is a piece in a mosaic, a predictive picture, compiled by collecting an array of information from diverse sources, including household buying habits, bill-paying records and social network connections. It amounts to a digital-age spin on the most basic principle of banking: Know your customer. Yet the technology is so new that the potential is unproved. Also, applying the modern techniques of data science to consumer lending raises questions, especially for regulators who enforce anti-discrimination laws. None of the new start-ups are consumer banks in the full-service sense of taking deposits. Instead, they are focused on transforming the economics of underwriting and the experience of consumer borrowing — and hope to make more loans available at lower cost for millions of Americans. Earnest uses the new tools to make personal loans. Affirm, another start-up, offers alternatives to credit cards for online purchases. And another, ZestFinance, has focused on the relative niche market of payday loans. They all envision consumer finance fueled by abundant information and clever software — the tools of data science, or big data — as opposed to the traditional math of creditworthiness, which relies mainly on a person’s credit history. Investors certainly see the potential; money and talent are flowing into this emerging market. Major banks, credit card companies and Internet giants are watching the upstarts and studying their techniques — and watching for the perils. By law, lenders cannot discriminate against loan applicants on the basis of race, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age or the receipt of public assistance. Big-data lending, though, relies on software algorithms largely working on their own and learning as they go. The danger is that with so much data and so much complexity, an automated system is in control. The software could end up discriminating against certain racial or ethnic groups without being programmed to do so. The data-driven lending start-ups see opportunity. As many as 70 million Americans either have no credit score or a slender paper trail of credit history that depresses their score, according to estimates from the National Consumer Reporting Association, a trade organization. Two groups that typically have thin credit files are immigrants and recent college graduates. Affirm says it is on track to lend $100 million during its first 12 months. More than 100 online merchants are now using its installment loan product, Buy With Affirm. Next up, the company says, will be student loans. Earnest was founded in 2013, and began lending last year. In 2014, its loans reached $8 million, growing gradually. By December the month-to-month growth rate was 70 percent, Mr. Beryl said. The typical Earnest loan is for a few thousand dollars, though they can range up to $30,000. Many of the loans are for relocation expenses and for professional training.\\n\\n\\nBig-data based lending story #2: Payday loans - where every borrower has poor history - attract big data models too, but fairness and discrimination concerns persist: The payday market is a niche compared with mainstream consumer and credit-card loans, two markets where start-ups are now applying data science to lending, as I wrote about in an article on Monday. Still, the payday market is a sizable niche. At any given time, there are an estimated 22 million payday loans outstanding, and the fees paid by payday borrowers amount to about $8 billion a year — a lot of money for those in the working population least able to afford it. Mr. Merrill saw a market in need of greater efficiency, a business opportunity — and the potential to lower costs to borrowers. ZestFinance has been practicing big data-style underwriting longer than most other start-ups. Founded in 2009, ZestFinance made its first loan in late 2010 and has increased its lending steadily since, having underwritten more than 100,000 loans. Its loans are called ZestCash, and the company is authorized to be a direct lender in seven states including Texas, Louisiana and Missouri. ZestFinance also handles the underwriting for Spotloan, an online lender that is part of BlueChip Financial, which is owned by the Turtle Mountain Band of the Chippewa Indian tribe of North Dakota. Winning over state regulators has been a slow process. “We’re showing up with a different kind of math,” said Mr. Merrill, who is now the chief executive of ZestFinance. “And that’s going to make it more difficult from a regulatory standpoint.” A healthy dose of caution is in order, policy analysts say. A recent report, by Robinson & Yu, a policy consulting firm, looked at new data methods as a way to make credit available to more Americans. In the report, supported by the Ford Foundation, ZestFinance was the featured example of big data underwriting, which it called “fringe alternative scoring models.” “I have no doubt that they have come up with neat correlations that are predictive,” said Aaron Rieke, co-author of the report and a former lawyer at the Federal Trade Commission. But the concern about ZestFinance and other start-up lenders using big data methods, Mr. Rieke said, is that “we have no idea how to talk about or assess the fairness of their predictions.” Mr. Merrill believes that such qualms will fade as data science lenders build a track record of offering lower costs and greater convenience to borrowers. The typical payday loan, Mr. Merrill explains, is for a few hundred dollars for two weeks, and rolls over 10 times on average, or 22 weeks. In a traditional payday loan, all the fees are paid upfront with the principal paid at the end, in a “balloon” payment. With ZestCash loans, borrowers are paying down principal with every payment, which reduces the cost. It also charges lower fees. In a traditional payday loan, Mr. Merrill said, a person would typically pay $1,500 to borrow $500 for 22 weeks. Using ZestCash, he says, a borrower generally pays $920 to borrow $500 for 22 weeks — still hefty fees, but far less than a standard payday loan. ZestFinance can charge less, Mr. Merrill said, largely because its data-sifting algorithms reduce the risk of default by more than 40 percent compared with a typical payday loan, and the software is being constantly tweaked to improve further. Borrowing candidates are asked to fill out an online form with their name, address, Social Security number, bank account information and a few other questions. ZestFinance then combines that with streams of information from data brokers and online sources, and sets its algorithms to work. The automated risk analysis, Mr. Merrill said, is done in a matter of seconds. The person is informed of the decision online. If approved, a customer service representative soon calls to verify the borrower’s identity, double check on numbers, and go through the loan terms again by phone. The data signals used to assess risk in the payday market are different than for most consumer loans. “In our space,” Mr. Merrill observed, “virtually everyone has a bankruptcy.” In payday underwriting, by contrast, signs of financial stability would include how long a person has had his or her current cellphone number or the length of time on a current job.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHi,\\n\\n\\n\\nHere are some interesting topical\\xa0snippets\\xa0culled from various sources. Archived\\xa0snippets\\xa0are\\xa0here, and a large database of links is\\xa0here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow can Xiaomi be so aggressive with its pricing? A small portfolio and longer average selling time. Many theories have been put forward, including claims that Xiaomi sells at cost and makes money from other services. Hugo Barra, the company’s VP of International, lifted the lid on some of the company’s secret sauce in an interview with TechCrunch in Beijing last week. Barra explained that Xiaomi is able to make price concessions thanks to the combination of a small portfolio and longer average selling time per device. Importantly, Xiaomi continues to sell older devices (and tweaked versions of them) at reduced prices even after it releases newer models. “A product that stays on the shelf for 18-24 months — which is most of our products — goes through three or four price cuts. The Mi2 and Mi2s are essentially the same device, for example,” Barra explained. “The Mi2/Mi2s were on sale for 26 months. The Redmi 1 was first launched in September 2013, and we just announced the Redmi 2 this month, that’s 16 months later.” That’s important because the longer runway for devices gives Xiaomi leverage to secure better component deals with its suppliers. “The reason we do these price cuts is because we’ve managed to negotiate component cost decreases [with our suppliers] over time, which ends up leaving us with a bigger margin than we’d like to have, so we do a price cut,” Barra added. “The vast majority of the components [in our devices] are still the same, so in terms of supply chain and component sourcing, we’re on the same supply contracts as Redmi 1, which means we’re still getting the same discounts on components,” he explained. “We can continue to ride the cost curve, so the importance of having a very small portfolio is significant — the fact that we only launch a few products each year, and (the fact that) we only have two product families.” There are other factors that contribute to the cost structure, including Xiaomi’s lean, online-only marketing focus and its location close to manufacturing plants in China , but the management of components and supply chain partnerships is a crucial element. The company sells its phone using an online-only model in most markets, but it has recently begun testing operator partnerships outside of China. It is running a limited trial with Airtel in India, and has found partners in Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. Barra explained that operator partnerships are difficult in markets where the majority of consumers are on pre-paid tariffs — such as India — but it seems clear that Xiaomi is looking into ways to expand its retail footprint. It sold one million devices in its first five months in India using its flash sales model. If it can move beyond that and better meet demand for its phones in India and other emerging markets, it could vastly increase its sales figures in 2015.\\n\\n\\nIndian e-com marketplace ShopClues raises $100M in Series D led by Tiger Global; despite turbulent history,ShopClues is now valued $450-500M: Clues Network Inc, the US-based parent of Clues Network Pvt Ltd that runs the horizontal e-commerce marketplace ShopClues, has raised $100 million (Rs 620 crore) in Series D funding led by Tiger Global besides two of its existing investors, the firm said on Monday. This values the company at around $450-500 million, a company executive privy to the development said on the condition of anonymity. The money will be used in product development and roping in more merchants on board, the firm said. The company had previously raised money from Helion Venture Partners, Nexus Partners and Beenos (formerly Netprice, a Japanese incubation cum investment group). It scooped $10 million in Series B round in March 2013. Prior to that it had raised around $5 million in Series A. It also raised an undisclosed amount—which is believed to be around $15-20 million— in Series C in April-May 2014 from Nexus and Helion. “So far we have brought 100,000 sellers and 10 million products online and the next three years will be focused on bringing 10 million sellers and 1 billion products to the online domain. We will continue to build technologies and services to enable and empower retailers to participate in the e-commerce revolution that is happening in India,” said Sanjay Sethi, CEO and co-founder, ShopClues. Lee Fixel from Tiger Global said, “Shopclues has emerged as the leading marketplace of choice for the millions of small and local businesses seeking to reach mass consumers in India’s tier 2 and tier 3 cities. Sanjay, Radhika and the team have done a great job aggregating the country’s largest online catalogue of regional and local brands and we are excited to partner with ShopClues as it expands its offerings.” The Gurgaon-based startup was founded by former Wall Street tech analyst Sandeep Aggarwal and a former eBay executive Sanjay Sethi in July 2011. The company went through a tumultuous period over the last two years after Aggarwal (then CEO) was found to have indulged in insider trading in the US in his past job and he later pleaded guilty to the charges. He has disassociated himself with his executive role at ShopClues. His wife Radhika Ghai Aggarwal has taken over more a direct role and is handling marketing at the firm and listed as a co-founder now. Meanwhile, Sethi became CEO after Sandeep Aggarwal was arrested in the US. A few months back ShopClues was again in news when one of the merchants selling through its platform was found to be allegedly selling counterfeit products under the L’Oreal brand. The Delhi High Court had restrained it from using the name of L’Oreal to sell or supply any goods. Currently, ShopClues claims to be doing 1.5 million transactions per month with 70 per cent of it coming from tier II & III cities. It claims to have 40 million monthly visitors. The firm had clocked net revenues of around Rs 30 crore with net loss of Rs 38 crore for the year ended March 31, 2014.\\n\\n\\nAmazon is going into the film production business: After winning acclaim for one of its original television productions, Amazon announced on Monday that it would produce and acquire films for theatrical release and early distribution on its Prime Instant Video service. Amazon original movies will be available for streaming in the United States four to eight weeks after they make their debut in theaters, a significant reduction of the window of 39 to 52 weeks that films normally play in theaters before becoming available for streaming. The development is another step in Amazon’s ambitious plan to increase its entertainment offering to consumers, and an escalation in Amazon’s rivalry with Netflix. It also signals both companies’ broader ambitions to revolutionize the so-called windowing system for television and movies in the traditional entertainment industry. Amazon said it was seeking to create 12 movies a year that “focus on unique stories, voices and characters from top and up-and-coming creators.” Production will start this year. In an email, Roy Price, vice president of Amazon Studios, described the projects as “indie” movies, with budgets between $5 million and $25 million. Analysts cautioned that if the films were low-budget and of low quality, it would be difficult for them to profoundly alter the conventional system for theatrical releases.\\n\\n\\nOnline insurance sales are squeezing agents in the US as Google, other tech firms find the insurance sector ripe for disruption: Technology start-ups, and companies from the insurance industry, are introducing websites that sell or promote a range of insurance including auto, homeowners and small commercial policies. These portals, which promise savings by showing consumers many price quotes so they do not have to shop site by site, are putting pressure on insurance agents, who collect 10 percent or more of their policyholders’ payments.Online insurance comparison is still a nascent business, and it has yet to make a dent in the armies of intermediaries that are the backbone of the trade. But people in the industry and Silicon Valley say it is only a matter of time. Even Google is getting involved.“There are 40,000 agencies in the U.S., and you could absolutely imagine them shrinking by a quarter, and the ones that are left will deal with more complicated needs and more affluent customers,” said Ellen Carney, an analyst who covers insurance for Forrester Research.The idea of selling insurance online is not new. Lately, though, the boring but lucrative trade has been attracting big names. The most recent is Google.Its Google Compare auto insurance site (basically a search engine for auto insurance prices) has been operating in Britain for two years, and Google is working on something similar for the United States. Google is licensed to sell insurance in about half of the states, according to research by Ms. Carney.Google has formed a partnership with Comparenow, an American auto insurance comparison site owned by Admiral Group, a British car insurance company that has operated a European price-comparison site for more than a decade. The venture will give Google access to insurers in Comparenow’s network.Admiral Group introduced Comparenow about a year ago. Not long after, Overstock.com, a retailer, started selling auto and other forms of insurance.Then there is Walmart, which does not sell insurance but recently formed a partnership with AutoInsurance.com. The insurer leases space in Walmarts, giving it access to the 140 million people who shop there each week. “A lot of people are waking up to the fact that it’s a massive industry, it’s old-fashioned, they still use human agents and the commissions are pretty big,” said Jennifer Fitzgerald, the founder and chief executive of PolicyGenius. “It’s ripe for — I hate to use the word — disruption.” Insurance is a fat target. In 2013, insurers wrote $481 billion in premiums for property and casualty insurance, which consists of mostly auto, home and commercial insurance, according to the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group. That would place a rough estimate of agents’ commissions — including commissions to small-time agents as well as to brokers who sell large commercial policies — at $50 billion. And while it might seem like an odd match for Google, whose projects include driverless cars, delivery drones and a pill to detect cancer, the key to insurance is having lots of data about people’s backgrounds and habits, which is perhaps the company’s greatest strength. “They have a ton of data on where people drive, how people drive,” said Jon McNeill, chief executive of Enservio, a Needham, Mass., company that makes claims-processing software. “It’s the holy grail of being able to price auto insurance correctly.”\\n\\n\\nWhat\\'s the deal? Softbank (and Alibaba) are heavily investing taxi apps that rival Uber the world over: SoftBank had no business in taxi-hailing apps until October 2014 when it led a $210 million investment in India’s Ola. That deal was announced as the first investment in SoftBank’s program to put $10 billion into startups in India. At the time, Ola appeared to be just one of a number of deals in India — while that is true, it also turned out to be the first of an expensive set of investments in companies rivals that rival Uber. SoftBank went on to invest $250 million in GrabTaxi in Southeast Asia, and last week it closed a third deal, leading a $600 million financing round for China’s Kuadi Dache. The operator, it seems is going all out for taxi apps but it may not stop in Asia. Alibaba led Lyft’s $250 million funding round in April 2014, which the U.S. company had earmarked for “international expansion”. At the time, the investment was a curious deal for Alibaba but, with the e-commerce giant backing range of other U.S. startups — including chat app Tango — it looked like an exploratory move to get some skin in promising companies in North America. However, SoftBank and Alibaba have a long history of collaboration — SoftBank is famously an early investor in Alibaba, and both companies put money into Kuadi Dache — and it could just be that Lyft forms a part of SoftBank’s taxi app focus. Perhaps the Japanese firm will put its own money in at a later date, or it will use its relationship with Alibaba to form a loose alliance to share information and tactics.\\n\\n\\nA Korean urban logistics startup that aims to be \"Uber for last-mile deliveries\" is in the news and gaining traction: Seoul-based urban logistics startup Naldo is gaining some serious momentum in its home country. The company, which works sort of like an Uber for last-mile deliveries, now boasts over 500 corporate customers, tripling its client base in the last year. \"We all buy more stuff online, but we are not aware that more online purchasing requires more offline delivery. That’s why this is an overseen goldrush for us,\" Ebner-Chung says. Among its clients are steel giant Posco, social commerce site Coupang, and investment bank Kyobo Securities. Naldo founder and CEO Ludolf Ebner-Chung says the company saw revenues grow 1,000 percent in 2014, with consistent double-digit growth every month since launching two years ago. Naldo works similar to other logistics-on-demand startups, like Gogovan and Easyvan in Hong Kong. With its mostly two-wheeled fleet, it promises delivery within 90 minutes in Seoul. The site connects clients directly to available nearby drivers with no middlemen involved. Next, Ebner-Chung says the startup will soon launch a native app and an open API, which has already been tested by popular ecommerce sites like Ticketmonster, WeMakePrice, and Ridibooks. He says this will be of significant value to online SMEs as it gives them delivery options to gain an edge on their competition. It also reduces dependency on the old call center-based logistics companies. Chung says South Korea’s B2B real-time delivery market is worth US$5 billion.\\n\\n\\nRocket Internet CEO: We build real companies; work for Google if you like sushi and comfy chairs: Silicon Valley hasn’t found much to love about Rocket Internet, the Berlin-based company that is often derided for simply copying everyone else’s ideas. Turns out, the disdain is mutual. Press-shy Oliver Samwer, chief executive and cofounder of Rocket, appeared on stage today at the Digital Life Design conference in Munich, Germany, for a rare interview. While he didn’t say much new about Rocket’s business, and seemed clearly uncomfortable with having to field questions, he did manage to get in a few shots at the folks in Silicon Valley. For instance, Samwer was asked about the idea that Rocket is an incubator, like the ones in a certain other high-tech regions. At first glance, that might appear reasonable. Rocket works with entrepreneurs to build Internet companies from scratch in areas like e-commerce and travel, scales them up, and then spins them out into stand-alone companies. Like an incubator, right? No, said Samwer. He said Rocket’s approach is a methodical process, repeated over and over. In what may be the greatest definition of incubators in history, Samwer explained why he thought Rocket was not an incubator. “I don’t like this word incubator. We are a platform,” he said. “An incubator sounds like you have some crazy chairs, and then there are fancy drinks and you eat free corn flakes.” Asked about the challenge of attracting talent and competing for hires against the likes of Google, Samwer sung a similar tune. He said someone could take a low-level job at Google, or they could come to Rocket where they could eventually build their own company. “The chairs might be more comfortable at Google,” he said. “And the drinks. I hear they have sushi. We are for the real people who want to build companies.”\\n\\n\\nZTE revenue up only 8% Y/Y in 2014, but profits up 94% Y/Y to $424M: Chinese telecom hardware company ZTE has had a banner year, according to a press release the company has issued prior to the release of its 2014 yearly report. While revenues have reportedly experienced only modest growth over 2014 (up just eight percent compared to the previous year) net profits year-on-year have grown 94.2 percent, from RMB 1.35 billion (US$217 million) in 2013 to RMB 2.64 billion (US$424 million) in 2014. ZTE’s profit growth over the past year is due to the fast growth in China’s 4G sector; ZTE has a hand in both TD-LTE and FDD-LTE hardware, so 4G growth has benefited the company. ZTE’s global 3G and 4G business, including hardware and handset sales, was also a contributor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The toll road into China\": Customs pre-approval, forex handling part of Alibaba\\'s major push to connect American retailers with Chinese consumers: Anchored by Alipay, the dominant Chinese electronic payments system that works closely with Alibaba and is controlled by its executives, the world\\'s largest Internet retailer is using the calling card of China\\'s consumers to attract U.S. partners, two sources close to the company told Reuters. Long seen as the most potent threat to Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) with $300 billion in global sales, the moves add up to a conservative approach to expanding in the United States, contrary to industry speculation that the company may be plotting a direct assault on U.S. soil. At the heart of its push are Alibaba\\'s and Alipay\\'s trial deals to handle Chinese sales, payment and shipping for some of the biggest names in U.S. retail from Neiman Marcus Group [NMRCUS.UL] to Saks Inc. Both confirmed the agreement but would not talk about how the pilots are faring. The Chinese companies will also work with U.S. startup Shoprunner, an online mall for U.S. retailers in which it owns a stake, and retail services provider Borderfree Inc (BRDR.O) to court Chinese consumers. And Alibaba is preparing a marketing campaign to raise awareness among U.S. businesses of its global business-to-business wholesale platform, Alibaba.com, so they can buy and sell to and from global suppliers. Alipay and a logistics-partner network that took years to assemble are central to Alibaba\\'s U.S. effort. Major brands, such as Nike, that have a large physical presence in China already sell directly on Tmall. But Alipay\\'s effort directly connects American merchants with China, without the need for investment in a physical presence. It also allows U.S. retailers and Chinese consumers to avoid difficulties associated with foreign exchange. Chinese consumers pay in yuan; U.S. companies get paid in dollars. Alibaba\\'s and Alipay\\'s program for U.S. companies is called ePass. It includes a customs pre-approval process, a sort of \"fast lane\" that shaves days off delivery. Daiwa analysts John Choi and Alex Liu call that capability Alibaba\\'s biggest advantage over rivals such as JD.com (JD.O). Alibaba and Alipay have made pilot agreements to handle payments and shipping to China for department stores Neiman, Saks, Macy\\'s Inc (M.N), Macy\\'s Bloomingdale\\'s chain, Ann Taylor, luxury fashion site Gilt, and apparel label Aeropostale (ARO.N), according to Borderfree. The companies declined to comment, although Neiman, Saks and Ann Taylor confirmed the deal. If a Chinese consumer bought a pair of shoes from Saks, for instance, Alipay would handle the financial transaction. The shoes go to a U.S.-based Alipay facility that handles the transfer to China. After clearing customs, a local partner typically would handle final delivery. \"They own the toll road into China\"\\n\\n\\nVerizon\\'s \"supercookies\" - injected into customers web traffic - are being used by an ad targeting firm that works with Google and Facebook on audience targeting: Back in November, privacy experts warned that a new kind of tracking technology called \"supercookies\" could allow Verizon Wireless customers to be monitored wherever they went on the Internet -- even if they took steps to protect their anonymity. Verizon downplayed those concerns. But now privacy researchers say they\\'ve uncovered an advertising company that is using the supercookie to help track the online activities of Verizon Wireless customers. Turn, an online advertising company that works with Google and Facebook, uses a unique identifier Verizon Wireless injects into its customers\\' Web traffic to collect data that makes it easier for advertisers to place targeted online ads, according to the researchers. Verizon, which developed that supercookie, a string of characters known as \"Unique Identifier Header\" or UIDH, to use for its own online advertising program, said it was looking into the issue. \"We are evaluating how third parties are using the UIDH in this evolving ecosystem and considering any appropriate response,\" Verizon Wireless spokesperson Adria Tomaszewski told The Post in a statement. Turn says it is \"reevaluating\" its methods and will suspend the respawning cookie. Verizon began tracking its retail customers -- those not on government or business contracts -- with this supercookie in November 2012. Customers can opt out of having their demographic data shared with Verizon\\'s advertising partners, but they cannot opt out of having the supercookie attached to their Web traffic. Turn\\'s use of the identifier highlights how data about someone\\'s online tracking practices can sometimes be deployed beyond its original intent -- making it harder than ever for consumers to control who has knowledge about their online activities. According to research by Jonathan Mayer, a Stanford graduate student and privacy expert, Turn uses Verizon\\'s identifier as a signal to \"re-spawn\" or bring back traditional cookies that customers have taken steps to remove. That conclusion was confirmed by ProPublica. Turn\\'s general counsel and chief privacy officer, Max Ochoa, confirmed Mayer\\'s analysis of how its program worked in an interview with The Post.  In a blog post, Ochoa defended the company\\'s practices, arguing that clearing cookies does not necessarily indicate that users did not want to be tracked. Verizon defended the supercookie in the face of criticism, posting a message on its Web site saying \"it is unlikely that sites and ad entities will attempt to build customer profiles for online advertising\" and noting that the identifier \"changes frequently.\" Researchers and privacy advocates weren\\'t convinced. Unique codes that are associated with consumers online activity often get shared in the larger advertising ecosystem in a process known as \"de-anonymizing\" which allows Web sites, advertisers and data brokers to piece together more complete portraits of the users they hope to target, experts say. \"A tracking technology like this could be used to build a comprehensive list of everywhere an individual is going online,\" said Moy. That could reveal information about a person\\'s health, religion, family status, sexual preferences, and other highly intimate aspects of your life, Moy said.\\n\\n\\nSeed funding is stagnant, but Series A and later rounds are still hot, analysis of VC funding data indicates: New data published today by Mattermark CEO and co-founder Danielle Morrill concerning the venture capital industry paints a relatively stiff picture: Seed rounds are taking it on the chin. More precisely, according to Mattermark, the number of seed rounds in 2014 fell compared to 2013, and the trend is accelerating. Bear in mind that the total dollar amount of money flowing into seed deals barely declined, so, of course, we are seeing the average seed deal increase. All this should square with your gut. It has felt for some time that the number of yahoos picking up a million dollars to build flipmeat for Yahoo has been declining. At the same time, the seed round your friend raised was almost a Series A. The data agrees. So has the seed bubble popped? I think it’s fair to say that it has despite the only slight decline in the total dollar amount that is being invested at the level. That’s due to the fact that we’ve become too loose with what counts as a seed round. So if we used an older measuring stick, the downtick would be more accelerated.\\n\\n\\nFacebook releases pattern recognition software to open source; potential applications include inferring the intent behind an internet search: Facebook said Friday that it was donating for public use several powerful tools for computers, including the means to go through huge amounts of data, looking for common elements of information. The products, used in a so-called neural network of machines, can speed pattern recognition by up to 23.5 times, Facebook said. The tools will be donated to Torch, an open source software project that is focused on a kind of data analysis known as deep learning. Deep learning is a type of machine learning that mimics how scientists think the brain works, over time making associations that separate meaningless information from meaningful signals. Companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter use Torch to figure out things like the probable contents of an image, or what ad to put in front of you next. “It’s very useful for neural nets and artificial intelligence in general,” said Soumith Chintala, a research engineer at Facebook AI Research, Facebook’s lab for advanced computing. He is also one of the creators of the Torch project. Aside from big companies, he said, Torch can be useful for “start-ups, university labs.” Certainly, Facebook’s move shows a bit of enlightened self-interest. By releasing the tools to a large community of researchers and developers, Facebook will also be able to accelerate its own AI projects. Mark Zuckerberg has previously cited such open source tactics as his reason for starting the Open Compute Initiative, an open source effort to catch up with Google, Amazon and Yahoo on building big data centers. Torch is also useful in computer vision, or the recognition of objects in the physical world, as well as question answering systems. Mr. Chintala said his group had fed a machine a simplified version of “The Lord of the Rings” novels and the computer can understand and answer basic questions about the book. “It’s very early, but it shows incredible promise,” he said. Facebook can already look at some sentences, he said, and figure out what kind of hashtag should be associated with the words, which could be useful in better understanding people’s intentions. Such techniques could also be used in determining the intention behind an Internet search, something Google does not do on its regular search.\\n\\n\\nPalantir raised money at $15B recently, and is looking for more: Palantir Technologies Inc. raised money at a $15 billion valuation late last year and is now looking for more funding, according to people with knowledge of the situation, as the data-analysis software startup seeks to expand its business. Palantir raised the money in late 2014 because investors were eager to invest, said one of the people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the details are private. The round totaled $500 million and was completed in November, said another person, who added that Palantir is currently raising even more financing. A Palantir representative declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported Palantir’s $15 billion valuation and current funding plans. The new valuation is up from the $9 billion that Palantir was valued at in late 2013 and underscores the soaring values of startups across Silicon Valley. Uber Technologies Inc., a San Francisco-based mobile car-booking company, reeled in two financings exceeding $1 billion each last year and was valued at $40 billion last month. Investors have been pumping money into U.S. startups, to the tune of $48.3 billion last year, the most since 2000, according to the National Venture Capital Association and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Palantir got its start building software that helped tie disparate databases together to make it easier to search and analyze information. The technology was a hit among police agencies and intelligence services that wanted to illuminate patterns of behavior among individuals and manage large volumes of data more efficiently. Wall Street firms have since emerged as Palantir’s biggest customers, using the company’s software to detect fraud and evaluate loans, among other things. Last March, hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors LP hired Palantir to boost surveillance.\\n\\n\\nGoPro\\'s stock dropped 12% after Apple patent, possibly because past Apple patents foretold gamechangers: Patents are granted all the time, but when Apple gets one, companies often shudder at the prospect that the tech giant may try to muscle into their industry. GoPro\\'s stock dropped 12 percent after the iPhone maker got a patent for a remote control system to take photos. In 2005, Apple filed a patent for \"hand held electronic device with multiple touch sensing devices.\" About two years later, the company unveiled its first iPhone, and people walking down the street never looked up again. In May 2005, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted Apple a design patent vaguely titled \"electronic device.\" But the images clearly resembled what would be revealed five years later: the iPad. If there was any doubt that Apple was going to replace Google Maps with its own app on the iPhone, that should have been put to rest in May 2012, when the Cupertino, California, company filed a patent for \"system and method for navigation guidance with destination-biased route display.\" As you might have guessed, about two weeks later, Apple announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference that it was kicking Google\\'s app to the curb in favor of its home-cooked alternative. Before Apple Pay was announced last September, a number of the company\\'s patents had pointed to its interest in providing a mobile payment service. One of them, filed in March 2011, was for a \"method and system for payment and/or issuance of credits via a mobile device.\"  Apple\\'s interest in biometric security is an example where companies in that industry didn\\'t shudder. Instead, they were elated by the attention paid to them by Apple and its rivals. Other phone makers, some of which had rudimentary fingerprint sensors predating the iPhone 5S, were less enthused. Apple showed its interest in incorporating an embedded authentication system back in this patent filed in 2008. In 2013, the iPhone 5S came with a fingerprint scanner on the device\\'s home button.\\n\\n\\nVirtual reality goggles, drones and data centers are all driving a hiring spree at Facebook Inc (FB.O) that is set to swell its ranks as much as 14 percent in the near term, according to a review of job listings on the company\\'s website. Oculus Rift, the maker of virtual reality headsets that Facebook acquired in a $2 billion deal last year, is among the key areas slated for growth, with 54 jobs listed on its website, according to a review by Reuters of listings. Among the roles that Facebook needs to fill for the Oculus business are managers to oversee logistics, procurement and global supply chain planning - a sign, some analysts say, that the product is nearing its commercial release. Facebook’s ambitious effort to build its own satellites and drones capable of delivering Internet service to remote regions of the world is another important area for hiring: the program has Facebook searching for specialists in areas such as avionics, radio frequency communications and thermal engineering. Atlas, the online advertising technology that Facebook acquired in 2013, is another big area of hiring, with more than 20 open positions listed. Facebook had 8,348 full-time employees at the end of September, far fewer than Google’s roughly 55,000 employees or Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) roughly 127,000 (Microsoft announced in the summer that it plans to cut 18,000 jobs). At the same time, Facebook gets more out of each employee, according to calculations using company revenue figures. Facebook’s revenue works out to roughly $384,000 per employee in the third quarter of 2014, versus $300,000 for Google and $183,000 for Microsoft.\\n\\n\\nUber plans to introduce background check procedures for its drivers in India, the company said Thursday evening, in a move that comes weeks after a driver was charged with rape there. The episode prompted wider scrutiny of the ride-hailing service that is now banned in some parts of the country. The company started operating in the Delhi region of India in late 2013, but has not screened those drivers, according to local Uber executives. Previously, Uber accepted new drivers if they presented proof of insurance, a driver’s license and a commercial permit to drive a taxi. That will soon change. Uber will run a series of more stringent checks on its drivers, which include a formal background check, verification of character by the local police and checks to detect fraud in driving and vehicle permits. Since the rape, Uber has pointed out the difficulty of screening drivers in hundreds of cities across the world, an argument that the company has also used in the United States to support its background check procedure. “This unfortunate incident has highlighted challenges in the systems due largely to nondigitized record-keeping and the lack of a centralized database for criminal offenders,” Ms. Delivala said. “To ensure verifications are legitimate and reliable, more needs to be done at the ground level.” In the United States, background checks for Uber are conducted by Hirease, a third-party service, which checks city, state and federal records. Lawmakers in many states, including California, Colorado and Illinois, have contested this approach, citing the more stringent checks required of taxi and limousine drivers.\\n\\n\\nEvernote\\'s new app turns smartphones into scanners via image-to-text conversion software: Scannable, an app from the note-taking service Evernote, turns your smartphone or tablet into a scanner by simply taking a picture of the document you want to record. Using recognition software, the app can then identify the words on the documents you’re scanning, so that you can search for keywords later. It will scan business cards and let you create new contact cards on the iPhone or iPad straight from the app — no typing required. The app doesn’t pick up every thing on a document, particularly if papers have been folded or crumpled. If you’re working on something for an official application or document, you may still want to opt for the old-fashioned scanner. But if you’re looking to keep quick notes or add contacts to your address book in a pinch, it’s reliable, free and easy to use. Free, for iOS devices.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA wild day in financial markets: Surprise rate cut in India sends Indian stocks soaring, a monetary announcement in Switzerland drives Swiss markets down 10% but sends Euro-area stocks sharply higher:  India’s central bank unexpectedly cut its benchmark short-term interest rates Thursday morning by a quarter percentage point as steeply falling prices for oil and other commodities have helped bring inflation under control and allowed the bank to focus more on allowing faster economic growth. The steep fall in world oil prices since the bank’s last interest rate review on Dec. 2 has been a big benefit for India, which relies almost entirely on imports for its oil and had been spending roughly $100 billion a year before oil prices plummeted. Switzerland stunned world markets on Thursday by abandoning a crucial part of its effort to hold down the value of its currency, concluding that the strategy was too risky and too costly given the enormous forces pushing in the other direction. The Swiss central bank had been trying to cap the value of its currency, the franc, against the euro, with nervous investors fleeing the market tumult and seeking the relative safety of Switzerland. But the euro’s decline has been particularly steep — and the rout may accelerate. The Swiss leaders’ abandonment of its target was taken as a bet that easier money from the European Central Bank is on the way, and potentially on a vast scale. The abrupt decision on Thursday sent the value of the Swiss franc soaring, as the country’s stocks broadly plummeted. The shares of exporters, in particular, got slammed over fears that the rising currency would weigh on profit. “Words fail me!” Nick Hayek, the chief executive of the Swiss watchmaker the Swatch Group, said in a statement distributed to news media, adding that today’s action “is a tsunami: for the export industry and for tourism, and finally for the entire country.” As it scrapped the cap, the Swiss central bank simultaneously cut interest rates, already in negative terrain, hoping to offset some of the damage in foreign exchange markets. It changed the rate on deposits to minus 0.75 percent from minus 0.25 percent, tripling what it costs lenders to park money at the central bank. But that was too little to stop the tide, and the franc jolted 15 percent higher against the euro. Swiss stocks plummeted in value as investors hastened to sell equities priced in francs. Euro-area stocks sharply higher at less competition from Swiss exports.\\n\\n\\nIntel Q4 Rev $14.7B, + 6% Y/Y, Net Income $3.7B, +39% Y/Y; Losses of $4B on mobile; Stock down mildly on weak outlook: Intel’s revenue for all of 2014 was $55.8 billion. However $49 billion of that was in PC and server chips. Mobile devices, considered an important growth area, had revenue of $200 million and losses of $4.2 billion. The transition to new devices matters, because for decades Intel’s model for success has been to make enough money to invest before rivals in advanced chip-making facilities, with transistors of almost unimaginably small size. If growth and profitably slip, Intel has big problems. It ended the year with $14.1 billion in cash, despite paying $4 billion in dividends and buying back more than $10 billion in stock. Profit margins increased over the year and the quarter, ending up at 65.4 percent. Intel reported that net income in the fourth quarter rose 39 percent to $3.7 billion, or 74 cents a share, from a year ago. Revenue was $14.7 billion, up 6 percent. Intel projected revenue in 2015 would grow “in the mid-single digits,” an improvement over some recent years. The earnings exceeded expectations, particularly given the lackluster sales of personal computers recently. On Monday, two popular analyst firms issued reports indicating the PC market was essentially flat in the fourth quarter, compared with a year ago. Intel’s PC business grew 3 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a year ago. The server business grew 25 percent, reflecting in part the growing influence of large cloud-computing systems in business and personal computing. Intel’s profit was significantly above the expectations of Wall Street analysts, who had predicted it would earn 66 cents a share, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters. Analysts thought Intel would have revenue of $14.7 billion. That suggests Intel has become relatively more profitable, through sales of products with higher margins or more efficient management. Still, Intel shares were off about 1.1 percent in after-hours trading, mostly on concerns that the company’s sales outlook was a bit below some expectations.\\n\\n\\nStudy Finds: Using Facebook and Twitter a lot can actually decrease stress — especially among women: It\\'s become almost common knowledge now that being constantly connected makes us unhappy, particularly when it comes to being inundated with incessant social media posts. There\\'s a reason that \"unplugging\" was a popular New Year\\'s resolution for 2015. But before you decide that limiting your Facebook posts or Twitter messages is the answer to all your problems, we have some news for you: Active social media use can actually lower stress levels -- at least for women. That\\'s the takeaway finding from a study published Thursday by the Pew Research Center\\'s Internet & American Life Project. Three things make this study stand out, said Keith N. Hampton, a Rutgers University communications professor and the paper\\'s lead author: Social media provide what Hampton calls \"supportive exchange.\" In other words, people feel less stressed because they can stay in contact with friends and family, and feel that community support. (The world \"social\" is a clue.Women tend to be, in Hampton\\'s words, the people tasked with \"maintaining household family relationships.\" So when it comes to social media, the technology may actually be helping them fulfill those tasks more efficiently and save them time. Women are more likely to be active sharers than men. And posting a quick photo on Instagram or update on Facebook is a low-cost, easy way to do that. \"Whether you share positive or negative events, sharing results in lowered levels of stress,\" Hampton said. \"While not everyone wants to see them all the time, [posting] may be important for women in reducing stress.\"\\n\\n\\nIndia startup action: 25 mobile startups shortlisted by IndiaQuotient for funding: Shippr: A logistics solution aimed at local deliveries.

Prior to this, Facebook has not offered real-time notifications outside of its own mobile apps, so this partnership is – according to UC Web – breaking new ground. Users interested in taking advantage of the new feature won’t have to do much: simply download the latest update for the browser, log into your Facebook account, and you should begin enjoying instant Facebook notifications right in the browser, no matter what page you’re on. This isn’t the first time UC has pushed to make its app more appealing to Facebook users, though. In June of last year, the company released a Facebook plugin for the app that speeds up Facebook’s loading time for users who choose to browse it within UC Browser. UC Browser is one of the most internationally successful tech products to emerge from China in recent years. UC Web recently announced that its browser is the most popular third-party mobile browser in the world. It even ranks above first-party browsers like Chrome and Safari in key Asian markets including China and India.\\n\\n\\nHow Amazon Listing Requirements for Sellers Evolved in 2014: Below are three tweaks Amazon made to its product listings in 2014 in efforts to improve product visibility and customer experience. If your Amazon listings don’t follow suit, you might as well turn your ship around and head home, because your listings will likely be lost in the vast Amazon ocean. Listing Optimization Framework: What does this mean for retailers? Listing quality improves product visibility and conversion. Listings with complete product information improve the shopping experience by making it easier for customers to not only find, but evaluate and purchase your product. Amazon has too many data requirements to list here, but retailers should break down and think about each of their listings using a List Optimization Framework, consisting of core data (product title, image, brand, etc.), categorization data (Item Type keyword) and product-specific data (size, color, style, etc.). Suppressed Listings: What does this mean for retailers? Amazon may already be suppressing some of your products. Regularly review Amazon’s Suppressed Products and address missing data. Ask yourself this question: Are all the items you’ve listed live on the site? Amazon will suppress product listings that don’t meet certain standards, so it’s important that you keep a close watch on which products are being suppressed. The Amazon Selling Coach can provide you with an updated list. Listing Visibility: What does this mean for retailers? Amazon will continue to increase listing requirements, so you should clean and expand your data now. Act like a buyer, review the product browsing process on Amazon.com and provide the attributes that are missing. Think of a traditional, brick-and-mortar store. Merchandise is organized logically and strategically so buyers can easily locate products. Amazon accomplishes this same merchandising concept online by using an Item Type keyword value to put your product in the right place. So make sure you’re using the right Item Type, so that your products are being cataloged correctly and finding the right shoppers. Data quality often becomes a problem for many retailers as they increase their number of SKUs and have more to keep up with. It helps to use a robust e-commerce platform provider that has the tools to keep your data accurate and up to date. Bottom Line: The massive product selection on Amazon brings with it a massive consumer base. And to retain customers and draw in new ones, Amazon will continue to evolve to better cater to consumers’ needs. And this goes well beyond updated listing requirements. As a retailer, if you’re not on top of Amazon’s evolutions — Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), mobile and social, advertising and promotions, and expansion (just to name a few) — you may risk becoming obsolete on the marketplace.\\n\\n\\nGoogle will stop selling Glass to the general public - but Google says the device is not dead yet. (More coverage here) A report from the Wall Street Journal on Thursday said Google will stop selling Glass to the general public Jan. 19.  The company confirmed the report and said Google will still give Glass units to developers and companies who want to look at its applications for the office as part of Google\\'s \"Glass at Work\" program, which has examined how the headset can help professionals such as doctors, emergency workers and filmmakers. On the consumer front, the company has been pretty quiet about Glass in recent months, a striking contrast to its splashy 2012 launch, when Google chief executive Sergey Brin unveiled the device by skydiving into the company\\'s developers conference. At first it was only available to developers, dubbed \"Explorers\" by the company, who wanted to play around with the new technology. Over the next year, Google tried to make the device more marketable to the general public by introducing. high-fashion frames, sunglasses lenses and prescription lenses for Glass. But the idea of a face-worn computer still met with skepticism, ridicule and even hostility from the general public. It also drew several comparisons to notable tech flops such as the Segway as a product that started with a good idea but was ultimately too niche -- and, honestly, too nerdy -- to catch on outside a group of dedicated enthusiasts. Despite originally hinting that it would launch a consumer version of Glass by the end of 2014, Google never did -- though the company did eventually let anyone with $1,500 buy their own developer version.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

Because users still convert on desktops - and as mobile traffic grows, overall conversions fall: 64 percent of Facebook ad clicks occurred on mobile devices during 2014\\'s fourth quarter, just 34 percent of the social media giant\\'s conversions—either a sale, download or completed lead-gen form—came from smartphones and tablets. This new stat, from Marin Software\\'s quarterly Global Online Advertising Index, means nearly two-thirds of all Facebook ad conversions are happening on desktops even though the digital platform\\'s usage is increasingly skewing toward mobile. The same study found that 39 percent of clicks on paid search ads from sites like Google were via mobile devices, yet 31 percent of the paid search category\\'s purchases came from mobile viewers. So the clicks/conversions ratio clearly favors Google over Facebook. In Q4, Marin found that Facebook\\'s desktop ads got a 1.1 percent conversion rate, while its mobile ads rendered a 0.3 percent conversion rate. Conversely, paid search on Google and other engines achieved a 10.1 percent conversion rate for desktop ads and a 6.6 percent conversion rate for smartphones and tablets. The reasons behind Google\\'s appeal to direct marketers are obvious when looking at those numbers. But Marin CMO Matt Ackley touted Facebook\\'s branding potential. \"The disparity points to the value in Facebook advertising being closer to television or print than performance-marketing channels,\" he said. \"Clicks on mobile ads are greater than desktop ads, indicating Facebook mobile ads are a great way for a retailer to build brand awareness and reach consumers on mobile devices. Consumers are not device or channel exclusive. They move from search to social sites.\" Therein may lie a challenge for Facebook: persuading retailers that their social ads can help search ads perform better. Meanwhile, there\\'s absolutely no doubt that search is going mobile. Marin\\'s data offers further proof, stating that as much as 49 percent of marketers\\' paid search budget is being manifested via tablet and smartphone.

And neither is Wal-Mart. Both giants bill themselves as places for good deals, but a new report from retail analytics firm Boomerang Commerce compares their strategies and sheds light on the ways they engineer pricing to get that reputation. What the authors find is that Amazon has carefully priced some items low, while leaving others more expensive -- in some cases, much more expensive -- to bolster its reputation as a place for deals. For instance, items with high consumer ratings tend to be priced lower than what you\\'d find at Wal-Mart. Boomerang provided the example of the Belkin N450 Dual Band Wireless N Router (despite the complex name, it\\'s just a standard WiFi router). On Amazon, it gets only 3.5 stars and is ranked 4,285 in the electronics department. Its price: $56.43. Wal-Mart\\'s Web site has it for $39.99. Also, stuff that\\'s highly visible -- products that either customers rave about or Amazon itself promotes -- also tend to be cheaper than at other places. But items that you wouldn\\'t naturally associate with online retail, such as tires for cars, aren\\'t cheap at all. And accessory items to highly promoted products -- think cable connectors for your new flat-screen TV -- aren\\'t always that cheap. And then there\\'s this: Amazon seems to know, likely by studying billions of shopping transactions, exactly the time of year when many people will buy an item even if the price is high, the study said. For instance, the online retailer seemed to know that a lot of people would be buying HDMI cables in the fall and the run-up to Christmas. Boomerang found that a pack of Twisted Veins HDMI cables went from just under $5 in the summer to more than $8 before Christmas. (Amazon.com chief executive  Jeffrey P. Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) The good folks at Boomerang created a chart that shows how prices interact with people\\'s perceptions of Amazon and Wal-Mart. Below, the firm\\'s chart shows common categories of products -- listed in the left column. The next column looks at what percentage of each category of products are sold by both retailers. The last two columns show how customers perceive the price differences between the two retailers (PPI stands for Price Perception Index). in the war for perception, Wal-Mart consistently beats Amazon in several categories, including automotive products, pet-related items, and household and home goods. People think those items will be cheaper at the big-box store than they are on Amazon\\'s site. And that perception appears to have encouraged Amazon to leave the prices of those items high. Amazon, meanwhile, takes the low-price perception prize for video games, toys and a variety of electronic goods such as wearable tech, accessories, phones, GPS units and cameras. And the researchers indeed could find examples where perception matched reality. The two retailers are more or less evenly matched when it comes to computers, televisions, cellphones and sports equipment, according to the report. In a statement, Amazon called the Boomerang paper “flawed” and said that Amazon is “obsessed” with providing low prices for its consumers.\\n\\n\\nChina\\'s taxi app wars intensify: Alibaba-Backed Taxi App Said to Be Raising $500 Million: A taxi-booking service backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA), is raising more than $500 million to expand in China, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Hangzhou-based company will issue new shares and receive investment from Alibaba, SoftBank Corp. (9984) and Tiger Global Management LLC, the person said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Kuaidi would be valued at more than $2 billion, the person said. Kuaidi competes with Uber Technologies Inc. and Didi Taxi, which is backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700), for the 500 million people in China using mobile phones to access the Internet for services and entertainment. Kuaidi prefers to pursue an initial public offering rather than be bought in a takeover, the company said in July. Kuaidi’s taxi booking app attracted 100 million users, who place about 3 million orders a day, according to an e-mailed statement from the company in July, which are the latest figures available. The service has more than 1 million drivers in about 300 cities. Kuaidi also introduced Yi Hao Zhuan Che, a luxury car-booking service, last year to compete with Uber. The San Francisco-based company’s valuation reached $40 billion in its latest fundraising round. Background: China’s taxi app market is dominated by two apps – Kuaidi Dache and Didi Dache. They both focus on regulated, licensed cabs, and so have avoided much of the legal issues that have beset Uber. In December last year, Didi Dache flagged down US$700 million in funding, making it the second highest funded taxi app in the world, netting more than Lyft, GrabTaxi and Ola. Tencent has put money into Didi Dache, turning taxi apps into a new frontier in the wide-scale battle between Alibaba and Tencent. Last summer Kuaidi Dache ventured into Uber’s area by launching a high-end on-demand car service called Kuaidi One. Kuaidi Dache now covers over 1 million taxis in more than 300 cities in China, including Hong Kong.\\n\\n\\nSnapchat maybe getting ahead of itself in its ad monetization efforts: charges more than YouTube, advertisers balk at poor reporting: Snapchat Is Asking Brands for $750,000 to Advertise and Won\\'t Budge Some brands balk at paying top dollar for one day of disappearing ads. Snapchat is asking brands for $750,000 a day for its new ads, according to multiple industry sources who have heard the pitch, and some say that\\'s too expensive for the young app. \"They [Snapchat] have minimums, and they are very firm on them,\" said one agency executive who has talked with Snapchat about advertising. \"From a monetization perspective, they are looking for fewer, bigger, better.\" However, there are drawbacks to Snapchat ads, including the platform\\'s lack of sophistication, sources said. Snapchat has limited reporting capabilities, for one; it can\\'t even tell brands how many men versus women saw an ad, and there are no age breakouts, the executive said. Also, brands are wary of paying top asking prices when their ads disappear, sources said. (Users can view a Snapchat post briefly, then it vanishes in a snap.) \"It\\'s very hard for marketers to get their hands around advertising that is so ephemeral,\" the source said. Snapchat has been trying to address data and reporting, and to be fair it is still very early in its ad business rollout. Last week, the service released its first study done with the help of MillwardBrown that showed users enjoyed the app\\'s first round of ads and that the ads helped boost brand awareness.  \"I\\'m a big fan of Snapchat, but they are going to market with rates that are significantly higher than what\\'s competitive out there,\" a top executive at a major brand said. \"It is difficult to go forward with a deal with Snapchat at the prices they are quoting.\" Snapchat is asking for rates that are higher than a masthead on YouTube, where a day costs about $500,000, another source said. \\n\\n\\nRumors swirl that Samsung will buy Blackberry for its patents; Blackberry stock surges, then falls on Samsung denial: Samsung Electronics recently offered to buy BlackBerry Ltd for as much as $7.5 billion, seeking its valuable patents as it battles Apple in the corporate market, according to a person familiar with the matter and documents seen by Reuters. Representatives from the two companies, which are working with advisers, met last week to discuss a potential transaction, the source said, asking not to be identified because the conversations are private. The Waterloo, Ontario-based company said in a statement that it \"has not engaged in discussions with Samsung with respect to any possible offer to purchase BlackBerry. Shares of BlackBerry, which soared nearly 30 percent following the Reuters report, fell back about 15 percent in after-hours electronic trading following the statement. Samsung also told Reuters in Seoul that it has no plans to acquire Blackberry. \"Media reports of the acquisition are groundless,\" a company spokeswoman said. BlackBerry, a one-time investor darling that pioneered smartphones, has regained some of its lost swagger under Chief Executive John Chen, who is leading a bid to regain market share it has lost to Apple Inc, Google Inc and Samsung. “To get a hold of the BlackBerry network and all its secure features, that would be a real coup for Samsung, looking to differentiate themselves from Apple and from others,\" he said. BlackBerry\\'s patent portfolio is composed of roughly 44,000 patents, worth more than $1.43 billion in net book value as of August last year, although many analysts think they could be worth much more. Edward Snyder, managing director of Charter Equity Research, said it made sense for Samsung to target BlackBerry\\'s patents in its outgoing battle with Apple and others, and that it likely would need to bid for the whole company because BlackBerry management did not want to only sell specific assets. \"Samsung will have to buy the whole thing and then and shutter what they don\\'t need,” he said. In the third quarter, revenue at BlackBerry, which is increasingly focusing on providing services like secure corporate networks, fell to $793 million from $1.19 billion a year earlier, falling short of analysts\\' expectations of $931.5 million.\\n\\n\\nZomato is in talks to raise $100M: Zomato Media Pvt Ltd, the company behind the popular restaurant listing and review site Zomato.com, is in talks to raise $100 million (Rs 625 crore) in a fresh funding, says a Reuters report quoting its co-founder and CEO Deepinder Goyal. This comes close on the heels of Zomato sealing its sixth acquisition in as many months and its biggest yet of restaurant information and table booking property Urbanspoon in the US for $52 million (Rs 325 crore). In November last year, Zomato had raised $60 million in funding at a pre-money valuation of $600 million from existing investors\\n\\n\\nInvestors Put $186 Million Into Lynda.com, an Online Tutorial Service, as US education startups get hot: Investor confidence in the education technology sector suddenly looks a lot more serious — at least for digital learning companies with proven business models. Lynda.com, an online video tutorial service that provides professional skills training to individuals and enterprise clients, announced Wednesday morning that it had raised $186 million in financing. The round was led by TPG Capital, a private investment firm. The sum dwarfs the largest ed tech financing deal of last year; in that deal, Pluralsight, another online training platform for professional skill development, raised $135 million from venture capital and private equity firms. The amount raised by Lynda.com also represents the largest ed tech financing deal in the last six years, according to CB Insights, a venture capital database that has been tracking the sector since 2009. Industry analysts said the Lynda deal was notable for other reasons, too. “It’s interesting, for one thing, that the round was led by TPG, a private investor likely to do more research on the market and revenue model than an early-stage investor focused on growth,” said Matthew Wong, a research analyst at CB Insights. Founded in 1995 as a training program for web design, Lynda.com is hardly a start-up. The company currently offers 5,700 courses online in English and other languages for professionals in business subjects like management; technology skills like programming and web development; and creative fields like video and photography. Lynda.com generated more than $150 million in revenue in 2014, Mr. Robison said, and has been profitable since 1997. He added that the company planned to spend the capital it raised on acquiring firms that specialize in technical and business skills training for professionals; on expanding internationally; and on improving the product experience for subscribers.\\n\\n\\nIndian capital market regulator Sebi is working on crowdfunding guidelines: SEBI is is holding consultations for “evolving guidelines” on crowd funding that will help start ups raise funds. Crowd-funding typically involves young entrepreneurs and small groups of people raising funds for their ventures through various online platforms involving individuals as well as organisations. Sebi whole-time member Rajeev Agarwal today said the regulator “was evolving guidelines in consultation with government for funding arrangements for star up entrepreneurs”. The market regulator had, in July last year, come out with draft norms on crowd funding. Under the proposed norms, the issuer entities and their promoters and directors would need to meet ‘fit and proper’ criteria of Sebi, while they can not use multiple platforms to raise such funds within a year, among others. According to Sebi, there is a need for funding for SME through alternative sources as 2008 global financial crisis made it difficult for banks to lend money to the ventures or start-ups, which may have high risk element. However, Sebi said there is possibility of systemic risk associated with crowd-funding as well as chances that investors could be defrauded.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstacart raises another $220M, valued at > $2B; Pinterest like UI, nimble org drive 10x growth in 2014: Instacart announced it had closed a $220 million round of venture capital from Silicon Valley investors like Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, among others. The new round brings the total amount of funding raised to $275 million, and values the company at a whopping $2 billion, according to two people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of continuing ties to the company. It is an ambitious bet on the future of how we think about grocery shopping and delivery services. The company, which was founded in 2012, allows customers to peruse the online catalogs of their favorite grocery stores — like Whole Foods, a major Instacart partner — and schedule deliveries directly to their homes. The user interface is akin to other consumer tech start-ups, like Pinterest, and lays out everyday grocery items in a simple-to-browse grid. Instacart is currently available in 15 American cities. The concept is not entirely new. Competitors like Fresh Direct, which operates primarily in New York, have offered local grocery delivery services for more than a decade. And even larger technology giants like Google, eBay and Amazon — companies with much more money and vastly greater resources than Instacart — have tried to play in the space with their own same-day delivery services. Apoorva Mehta, Instacart’s chief executive, said his company’s size and structure is why it is likely to succeed. “We have the ability to try new things in a very quick way,” Mr. Mehta said in an interview. “We don’t hold inventory, we don’t own warehouses, we don’t own trucks. The changes we make are software changes.” That, Mr. Mehta said, is in stark contrast to companies like Google and eBay, which are much larger and offer a wider range of delivery items. Ebay Now, eBay’s same-day service, touts its ability to deliver anything from big-screen TVs to hammers and nails from companies like Best Buy and Home Depot. He said Instacart’s focus on one particular type of product, groceries, allows the company to be more nimble than its competitors. The proof, Mr. Mehta said, is in the growth numbers. Instacart would not provide specific financial information, but it said that its revenues grew by more than a factor of 10 in 2014, and doubled in the final quarter of last year alone. While the company employs only around 100 employees, it has more than 4,000 contract employees who do its shopping and delivery.\\n\\n\\nIBM Introduces z13, a mainframe with potential eCommerce applications: more coverage here IBM has designed the latest version of the mainframe, which is being introduced on Wednesday, with the smartphone in mind. The new mainframe, the z13, has been engineered to cope with the huge volume of data and transactions generated by people using smartphones and tablets. IBM spent $1 billion to develop the z13, and that research generated 500 new patents, including some for encryption intended to improve the security of mobile computing. Much of the new technology, Mr. Rosamilia said, is designed for real-time analysis in business. For example, he said, the mainframe system can allow automated fraud prevention while a purchase is being made on a smartphone. Another example, he said, would be providing shoppers with personalized offers while they are in a store, by tracking their locations and tapping data on their preferences, mainly from their previous buying patterns at that retailer. These real-time applications, according to Donna Dillenberger, a distinguished engineer at IBM’s Watson lab, can be done in a mainframe environment. They are not yet possible on clusters of smaller, industry-standard computers, she said. But there are several open-source software projects, like Apache Spark, that focus on real-time data processing across large numbers of computers.TechCrunch reports:  IBM claims this machine has the ability to process 2.5B transactions per day, the equivalent of 100 Cyber Mondays every single day, or so they say. Mike Gilfix, who is director of enterprise mobile at IBM said with its latest model, the company paid particularly close attention to the growing complexity around mobile transactions and designed the system to handle the intricate interplay between systems, while maintaining security with what they are calling “real-time mobile encryption,” and providing high-end analytics on the fly. As an example, he talked about a single eCommerce transaction on a mobile device. When we touch Buy, he explained, it requires a bunch of different systems to communicate including credit card transactions, inventory control and shipping — and they all have to work in tandem. He said when you extrapolate that out into billions of transactions moving across conventional networks, the power of the z13 can eliminate much of the lag. Gilfix suggested that the majority of sales would probably come from existing customers in finance, large retail customers and healthcare, and others who have a large investment in data stored on mainframes already. Still, the company is hoping that the mobile nature of this system will attract buyers who might not have considered a mainframe in the past. One scenario Gilfix suggested is using the z13 as a private cloud and running OpenStack on it, which is certainly an interesting idea.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba buys controlling stake in digital marketing firm AdChina: China\\'s e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd said on Wednesday it had bought a controlling stake in online marketing company AdChina, an investment aimed at bolstering its advertising business. Alibaba did not close the size of the deal or the stake it would take in AdChina, a Shanghai-based firm founded in 2007. The internet marketing firm, which generated $51 million in sales in 2011, had filed for a $100 million initial public offering in Feb. 2012, but pulled the listing a year later. The deal is the first Alibaba has disclosed this year, after spending more than $6.2 billion on acquisitions in 2014, the same year as its record-setting $25 billion New York listing. The AdChina investment is geared towards improving Alibaba\\'s online and mobile advertising efforts through Alimama, the group\\'s advertising arm. This unit sells marketing to merchants using Alibaba\\'s e-commerce sites like online marketplace Taobao and online retail platform Tmall.com.\\n\\n\\nGoPro plunges on Apple patent win: GoPro shares plummeted 12 percent, their steepest decline since August, after Apple  was granted a patent for a remote-control camera system. The stock dropped to $49.87 at the close in New York. The plunge followed Apple gaining a patent today from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for a system that lets consumers control a digital camera remotely. Investors are concerned that the patent will let Apple, the world’s largest company by market valuation, make products that are similar to what GoPro offers, said Charlie Anderson, an analyst at Dougherty & Co. Apple sold more than 270 million units of its various products in fiscal 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. GoPro, which went public in June and is trading at more than twice its initial public offering price of $24 a share, has been volatile in recent months. The world’s biggest maker of wearable cameras used by surfers and sports enthusiasts to record their exploits is facing questions about its ability to create a media business around the videos that consumers post online using their GoPro devices. About half of the company’s outstanding shares will also become available on the market on Feb. 17 when a lock-up lifts on employees and other insiders’ shares, Anderson said.\\n\\n\\nFrance’s BlaBlaCar comes to India with ride-sharing between cities; its first expansion outside Europe:  While taxi apps like Uber and Ola find themselves in a regulatory quagmire in Indian cities, a new car pooling service has just come in for rides from one city to another. France-based BlaBlaCar launched in India today, its first stop in Asia. This follows the arrival late last year of Tripda from Brazil, another ride-sharing marketplace. “India, with its young, highly connected population, and multiple major urban hubs separated by long distances, has great potential for ridesharing. Chronically overcrowded transport infrastructure forces travellers to book their train or bus tickets weeks in advance, while the high price of fuel makes long-distance car travel often unaffordable. BlaBlaCar will make last-minute city-to-city travel both available and affordable. Car-owners will be able to offer seats to co-travelers, so they can travel together and share fuel costs,” says Nicholas Brusson, co-founder of BlaBlaCar. BlaBlaCar connect drivers who have empty seats in their cars for a long distance ride with co-travellers. The charge for the co-traveller is limited to sharing the fuel and running costs; so it’s not meant to be a profit-making avenue for drivers. The company usually takes a 10 percent cut from what the co-traveller pays or driver receives. BlaBlaCar had a US$100 million funding round last year, and operates in 13 countries in Europe. India is its first market outside Europe. BlaBlaCar will initially operate out of Delhi and its satellite town of Gurgaon, connecting cities in north India. Delhi is where Uber got into trouble last month after the arrest of a driver for raping a young woman, and still faces a ban as regulators insist on compliance with their rules. Car pooling services like BlaBlaCar, however, have yet to come under that kind of scrutiny. BlaBlaCar’s co-founder makes a distinction between a marketplace model and a taxi app. “At Uber, you don’t choose your driver,” says Brusson. “At Blablacar, there’s a two-way community where you need acceptance from both sides.”\\n\\n\\nApp Annie raises $55M in series D: App Annie, an app analytics service for developers, revealed today that it has secured US$55 million in series D funding. The investment eclipses the previous US$17 million round in May 2014, which was accompanied by news that it had acquired competitor Distimo for an undisclosed sum. App Annie’s newest input comes from Institutional Venture Partners (IVP), with participation from existing investors Sequoia Capital, Greycroft Partners, and IDG Capital Partners. App Annie claims it doubled its team to 300 employees in 2014 and tripled its revenues.\\n\\n\\nFlipkart reports some marketplace stats:  Flipkart today said it aims to help over 10,000 sellers generate business worth Rs 10 lakh through its platform this year. “In 2014, Flipkart helped over 2,000 sellers become millionaires through Flipkart sales. December 2014 alone saw over 500 sellers doing an average business of Rs 10 lakh each, while 50 sellers did an average of Rs 1 crore each,” Flipkart said in a statement. With a year on year growth of close to 30 per cent, apparels and consumer electronics categories have the most number of sellers who have crossed the millionaire mark followed by sellers of home decor, jewellery, handicrafts and large appliances. Nearly 60 per cent of millionaire sellers came from metros (Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore) and the rest from the non-metros, it said. “2015 projections estimate that the numbers from the latter will double,” the statement added.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndian startup action#1: Mobile internet firm One97 Communications raises $575M from Alibaba, valued at $2B: On97, seeking funds to boost its flagship m-com and virtual wallet property Paytm, is raising $575 million from the world’s largest e-com firm Alibaba and the group’s separate payment unit Alipay. This is in addition to $60 million more from existing lead investor SAIF Partners, sources close to the development told Techcircle.in. The deal would value One97 at around $1.5 billion pre-money or just over $2 billion, post-money. This would make it the second most valued internet related firm in India, behind Flipkart. For Alibaba, this would be the first significant strategic move in the country and its biggest bet since last September when it saw through its mega $25 billion public float on NYSE, the world’s largest ever. Founded in 2000, One97 Communications is a leading mobile-internet company in India that offers digital goods & services to its mobile consumers under the Paytm brand. It also provides mobile advertising, marketing and payments for merchants. In addition, it has a partnership with existing lead investor SAIF Partners where it invests in early stage mobile internet startups through One97 Mobility Fund. Meanwhile, One97 has also applied for a ‘payments banking’ licence and part of the funds raised would be used to double its reach in India with investments in technology and customer acquisition.\\n\\n\\nIndian startup action #2: Zomato enters US with purchase of Urbanspoon for around $40-50M, aims at Yelp: Zomato.com has struck its sixth overseas acquisition in as many months and its biggest yet by acquiring Urbanspoon, a restaurant information and table booking property, the company’s co-founder and chief Deepinder Goyal said in a blog post. The transaction value stands undisclosed but is pegged at around $40-50 million. Goyal said in his blog post that the firm spent most of its last round of funding on this acquisition. In November, Zomato had raised $60 million in a fresh round of funding at a pre-money valuation of $600 million from existing investors Info Edge (India) and Sequoia while adding Vy Capital as a new investor. Urbanspoon, which was part of NASDAQ-listed umbrella firm for various internet ventures IAC, has a presence in six countries including US, Canada, Ireland, UK, Australia and New Zealand. It was a self funded venture before IAC snapped the firm in 2009. It has 80 million+ visit a month as against 35 million+ of Zomato; presence in over 500 cities as against 150 million+ for Zomato with over 1 million restaurant listings, over 1.4 million reviewers and around nine times the number of ratings compared to Zomato. The acquisition would make the first big move by an Indian internet venture in the US. Zomato’s approach of hiring people to curate and constantly update restaurant listings and menus will present a challenge to Yelp and Foursquare, which rely more on user-generated reviews. This involves a lot of legwork but pays off for Zomato as users are less likely to encounter an outdated menu or a restaurant that has no resemblance to its review.\\n\\n\\nJD.com makes an eCommerce platform play as Chinese eCommerce goes niche:  \"JD.com is trying to position itself as the go-to e-commerce platform, and this could be an important category expansion for them,\" said John Choi, a Hong Kong-based Internet analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets. China\\'s JD.com Inc has ratcheted up competition with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd through a $1.55 billion deal with an online car sales portal, as the e-commerce giants gun for high-value markets like cars, tourism and homes. Following over a year of fervent investment activity in China\\'s tech sector, niche e-commerce markets are now in vogue as targets, analysts say. Taking stakes in specialists like Bitauto Holdings Ltd offers an avenue into big-ticket purchases which fall outside major e-commerce companies\\' traditional focus of day-to-day goods. Such tie-ups also lend smaller firms some of their bigger peers\\' clout, directing potential customers their way from websites like those of JD.com and Alibaba.  JD.com\\'s deal late last week was the company\\'s biggest ever, with its share of the investment in Bitauto valued at $1.35 billion. Chinese social networking and video game giant Tencent Holdings Ltd, which owns 17.6 percent of JD.com, will also take a 3.3 percent stake in Bitauto. Beijing-based JD.com will take 25 percent of Bitauto, giving China\\'s second-biggest e-commerce player a foothold in auto sales. Bitauto will in turn benefit from JD.com\\'s much larger audience and brand recognition, as the online retailer drives traffic to the car sales specialist. Other specialist areas attracting players like JD.com, Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu Inc include tourism and pharmaceuticals. Last month, JD.com and investment firm Hony Capital led a $148 million round of funding in travel company Tuniu Corp. Alibaba invested 2.81 billion yuan ($454 million) in a hospitality technology provider in September to help the e-commerce firm develop its own travel business. Last week, JD.com Chief Executive Richard Liu in a press release on the Bitauto deal signaled that investments in specialist commerce companies would continue for some time.\\n\\n\\nApple Watch isn\\'t even out yet, but retailers are already installing beacons for location targeting:  Apple already seems fairly well positioned to own the smartwatch industry, even though its watch won\\'t go on sale until later this spring. But that\\'s not stopping marketers from already experimenting with it. Today, Marsh Supermarkets will reveal that it has installed beacons in all of its 75 stores. Once Apple Watch hits the market, the brand plans to send beacon-triggered reminders straight to shoppers\\' wrists. For example, the smartwatch app may pull up a shopping list once someone is inside a store. \"If you look at that situation when you\\'re running through a store, how much more convenient is it to have a hands-free option to see what you\\'re making for dinner or understand what the deals are when you\\'re in-store?\" said Todd Dipaola, CEO of inMarket, the platform that\\'s powering the in-store activation. Shoppers who use Marsh\\'s mobile app or one of the apps in inMarket\\'s network (including LisEase, Key Ring and Epicurious) may now get pinged with offers or recipe suggestions in store. Per comScore, inMarket reaches 33 million active monthly users. Apple Watch is expected to work with the same apps that brands have built for smartphones. \"We\\'ve built the integration ahead of the debut so on day one—as the Apple Watch comes out—these apps can be ready for prime time,\" Dipaola said. Marsh will also link the mobile offers to its loyalty program to track coupon redemption and sales data. That data will then be used to serve up more relevant ads to the smartphone user in the future, the retailer said. For example, Marsh can measure the time between when someone first saw an ad to when they checked out.\\n\\n\\nBefore Xiaomi\\'s latest fund-raise, Facebook, Xiaomi had talked, but their deal fell through on political concerns: Mark Zuckerberg and Xiaomi Inc CEO Lei Jun discussed a potential investment by Facebook in China\\'s top smartphone maker ahead of its $1.1 billion fundraising last month, but a deal never materialized, several people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The discussions, at a private dinner when Zuckerberg visited Beijing in October, were never formalized, three of those people said, as the two CEOs weighed the political and commercial implications of Facebook - which has been banned in China since 2009 - buying into the Chinese tech star now valued at $45 billion. One individual with direct knowledge of Xiaomi\\'s fundraising said the mooted Facebook investment was \"not huge,\" but the talks underscore how ties between U.S. and Chinese companies have deepened as China\\'s tech industry matures. Xiaomi\\'s Lei was partly put off by the potential for political fallout at home of selling a stake to Facebook while the U.S. social network is still banned in China, two of the people said, adding Xiaomi also feared a tie-up with Facebook could threaten its relationship with Google Inc, a crucial business partner. Xiaomi\\'s phones are built on Google\\'s Android operating system. Xiaomi ultimately announced last month it raised $1.1 billion from investors including Hong Kong-based tech fund All Stars Investment; DST Global, a private equity firm that has invested in Facebook and Alibaba Group; Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC; Chinese fund Hopu Management; and Alibaba founder Jack Ma\\'s Yunfeng Capital. The fundraising valued Beijing-based Xiaomi at $45 billion just three years after it sold its first smartphone. The company had revenue of close to $12 billion in 2014.\\n\\n\\nCode containers - popularized by Docker - win following at Google, Goldman, IBM, Microsoft: A tech start-up called DotCloud was on its last legs in 2012. Now called Docker, its software has been downloaded 70 million times. Docker is at the forefront of a new way to create software, called containers. These software containers are frequently compared with shipping containers. And as their popularity grows, building big computer networks could become remarkably simpler. Like the big metal containers that can move from ship to ship to truck without being opened, software containers ship applications across different “cloud computing” systems and make it easy to tinker with one part, like the products for sale on a mobile application, without worrying about the effect on another part, like the big database at the heart of the corporate network. “It absolutely makes it easier to write applications,” said Eric Brewer, Google’s vice president for computer infrastructure. Google developed the first type of container, for internal use, about eight years ago, which helped it build its Internet services quickly. Docker took the Google innovation and made it easy for people to use across computers. “It’s a huge efficiency gain in how you write code,” said Mr. Golub, who started his career teaching business courses in Uzbekistan. “You don’t have to rewrite everything, then fix all the breaks when it goes into production. You just work on what you change.” Goldman Sachs uses Docker to build and deploy the software it runs internally. “Our underlying software was getting so spread out” that it was difficult to manage, said Don Duet, a global co-head of technology at Goldman. “Docker is a central place where you can put everything.” A 26-year technology veteran, he compares software containers in importance to Java, a programming language created in the 1990s that led to rapid growth of the commercial Internet. At least for now, Docker’s small size and independence may be assets, since it is able to play with the giants without seeming like a threat. Microsoft in October announced it would work with Docker to put its Windows operating system in containers (Docker already works with several types of Linux, the operating system commonly used in the servers of many big clouds). IBM is working with Docker to increase the international deployment of containers. And Google and Amazon have both endorsed Docker at their events for software developers.\\n\\n\\nEducation start-ups might finally have their moment in the sun: The education technology business is chock-full of fledgling companies whose innovative ideas have not yet proved effective — or profitable. But that is not slowing investors, who are pouring money into ventures as diverse as free classroom-management apps for teachers and foreign language lessons for adult learners. Venture and equity financing for ed tech companies soared to nearly $1.87 billion last year, up 55 percent from the year before, according to a new report from CB Insights, a venture capital database. The figures are the highest since CB Insights began covering the industry in 2009. Notable financing deals include Pluralsight, a company that provides online training to technology professionals, which raised $135 million; Remind, a free messaging service for teachers to communicate with students and parents, which raised $40 million from venture capital firms including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers; and Edmodo, an online social network customized for classroom use that is free to individual teachers, which raised $30 million. Education is one of the last industries to be touched by Internet technology, and we’re seeing a lot of catch-up going on,” said Betsy Corcoran, the chief executive of EdSurge, an industry news service and research company. “We’re starting to see more classical investors — the Kleiner Perkinses, the Andreessen Horowitzes, the Sequoias — pay more attention to the marketplace than before.” The smaller sums going into ed tech illustrate the challenges facing start-ups as they try to persuade public school systems to adopt their novel products. Companies often must navigate local school districts with limited budgets and slow procurement processes. To bypass the bureaucracy, many start-ups are marketing free learning apps and websites directly to teachers in the hopes that their schools might eventually buy enhanced services. Still, it is too early to tell whether that direct-to-consumer “freemium” strategy, as it is often called, will pan out for education software. “There are still a lot of questions around some companies’ business models in the sector,” said Matthew Wong, a research analyst at CB Insights. “One of the questions, because the product is free, is: ‘How are you going to monetize those users?’ ” One example is Remind, a popular messaging app that teachers use to send homework reminders to students and share classroom news with parents. Sports team coaches also use the system to send weather updates and schedule changes to their athletes. Word of mouth has propelled Remind from an unknown brand to a nationwide phenomenon. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJD.com and Tencent back the same horse - to invest $1.55 billion in Chinese auto e-commerce site Bitauto:  Chinese auto information website operator Bitauto Holdings Ltd said JD.com Inc and Tencent Holdings Ltd would invest about $1.3 billion in the company, sending its shares sharply higher in early trading on Friday. E-commerce company JD.com and Tencent, best known for its communications app WeChat, will also invest a total of $250 million in Bitauto unit YiXin Capital Ltd. JD.com, China\\'s No. 2 e-commerce company after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, will invest $400 million in cash and about $750 million in resources to Bitauto, whose sites offer sales data and other information on new and used vehicles as well as customer reviews.

On Friday, Infosys said it was also using its workforce more efficiently, with a utilisation rate of 82.7 percent excluding trainees, its highest in 11 years. Attrition, or the number of people leaving or retiring, fell in absolute terms to 8,900 employees in the third quarter from 10,100 in the quarter before. India’s second largest software company reported a 13 percent on year increase in net profit to Rs 3,250 crore and 6 percent rise in revenue to Rs 13,796 crore for the quarter ended December, sending its shares soaring about 6 percent yesterday. The company’s cash and cash equivalents stood at Rs 34,873 crore as on 31 December. With a change in the top leadership, there are expectations that the company will start using this cash more productively. \"We are interested in acquisition of small innovative companies. We are not interested in acquiring technologies from yesterday, but in acquiring technologies of tomorrow,\" Sikka had told analysts in a recent interaction.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAmazon takes 1.3 days on average to return cash, the quickest among online stores, and customers respond, according to new research from StellaService Inc., which tracks e-commerce data. While most Web stores will only pay once a return parcel is on its way, Amazon offers instant refunds for some purchases, issuing immediate credit and 30 days to return a product. Instead of tying up cash and preventing customers from buying other things, Amazon’s aim is to get people spending again. That’s especially critical during and after the annual holiday shopping season, when gift returns spike and consumers are predisposed to buy merchandise. Fast refunds are also important in Internet commerce because shoppers buy things they haven’t touched or tried, making return rates higher than in retail outlets. “Amazon is killing it on refunds and others should follow suit,” said Eduardo Vilar, chief executive officer of Returnly Technologies Inc., a San Francisco company that researches retail returns. “Customers who are given the right experience on a return are more loyal shoppers.” Amazon’s instant refund, which was rolled out quietly last year, gave the Web retailer the fastest refund-processing time out of 40 companies measured by StellaService. Amazon’s closest competitors in refund-processing speed include online furniture and home goods retailer Wayfair Inc. (W) and personal computer and printer-maker Hewlett-Packard Co., which both took about three days to issue refunds, according to StellaService. The average refund-processing time of the 40 companies tracked by the researcher was more than nine days.\\n\\n\\nOffline retailers bet on smart in-store tech: Neiman Marcus is reinventing the mirror: The retailer announced Thursday that it has installed a MemoryMirror from MemoMi in its Walnut Creek, Calif. store. It plans to install two in its San Francisco store later this month and then two in Dallas. The mirror* allows for shoppers to compare in real time how different outfits look on them. After trying on clothes in the fitting room, a customer can head to the sales floor where the special “mirror” is located. A customer controls the mirror with an iPad, instructing it when to start recording or take photos. Then he or she can try on additional outfits, and compare video footage. Two outfits can be looked at side-by-side, and the mirror stores as many clips as the customer wants. So a customer could try on a dozen looks, take videos of each, and quickly compare how each look. There’s also the option to e-mail videos or photos to friends for their input, or share on social media. The MemoryMirror isn’t technically a mirror, but a 70-inch screen with a camera on top that films the consumer. MemoMi founder Salvador Nissi Vilcovsky says the secret sauce is its perspective distortion correction, which automatically sizes  the mirror to fit the customer. So no matter if you’re standing four feet in front of it or 10 feet away, it proportions the mirror so the customer fills the shot. “The world is going in the direction of in-store devices and personalization. We want to make these devices as cheap as possible and give these services not only for luxury brands,” said Vilcovsky. Nordstrom and Rebecca Minkoff have also dabbled in the smart fitting room space, using eBay technology. MemoMi is working on adding features to its MemoryMirror that allow a customer to see how they look in different colors or patterns of the clothes they’re trying on. Vilcovsky also envisions one day technology such as this being available on consumers’ televisions.\\n\\n\\nBox is finally close to $162M IPO, valulation likely lower than last round of funding: After months of delay, Box is finally close to making its stock market debut. Box, the online data storage provider, disclosed on Friday that it was seeking to raise up to $162.5 million in its initial public offering, as the company embarked on a road show for potential investors. (If demand proved high, the company could sell additional shares and raise up to $186.9 million.) In an amended prospectus, Box said that it planned to price its shares at $11 to $13 a share. At the midpoint of that range, the company would be valued at about $1.4 billion — less than the valuation the company fetched in a private $150 million fund-raising round last summer. Founded in 2005, Box became one of the most prominent independent providers of online storage and file sharing services, particularly for corporations. But the company has been somewhat overshadowed by the much bigger Dropbox, a member of the 11-digit club of start-ups with a $10 billion or more valuation, and rival file-sharing offerings from technology juggernauts like Google. According to its prospectus, Box still hasn’t turned a profit. It lost $121.5 million in the nine months ended Oct. 31, a slight narrowing from the same time in the previous year. Sales, however, jumped 80 percent during that same period, to $153.8 million. And Box has asserted that it has won clients like General Electric, DirecTV and AstraZeneca. The company first filed to go public last spring, but put off its I.P.O. plans as a sudden investor distaste for risky technology companies rippled through the markets. Since then, the start-up has waited for a more propitious time to make its stock market debut. Bankers and companies are betting that time is now. Last month, a number of technology start-ups, ranging from the peer-to-peer lending juggernaut Lending Club to the data analysis provider New Relic, enjoyed strong trading debuts. The company is expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “BOX.”\\n\\n\\nAmericans teens switching to Snapchat, but adults are still loyal to Facebook; Instagram, Pinterest gaining, Twitter and LinkedIn losing: Pew study of user engagement: American Teenagers may be spending more time on messaging services like Snapchat, but American adults are still increasing their use of social networks, according to a new survey released Friday by the Pew Research Center. The Pew survey, conducted in September, found that 52 percent of Internet users regularly logged on to at least two social networks, up from 42 percent in Pew’s August 2013 survey. The percentage of adults using Facebook, the most general social network, stayed about the same, at 71 percent of the online population. But Pew found significant increases in the number of people using Instagram, a photo service owned by Facebook; Pinterest, a visually oriented service for “pinning” favorite items; LinkedIn, a business networking service; and Twitter, a microblogging service oriented toward real-time news and information. Facebook users were the most dedicated, with 70 percent logging in at least once a day. Nearly half of Instagram users visit the site daily. Twitter, which has reported slow user growth in recent quarters, saw fewer visits from its American users, according to the Pew study. Only 36 percent of them visit the site daily, the researchers found, compared with 46 percent in the 2013 survey. In a statement after the survey data was released, Twitter disputed the findings, saying, “Pew’s data is so wrong as to be laughable. As we said at our Analyst Day in November, 48 percent of our monthly active users in our top 20 markets use the service daily, and the U.S. is our top market,” said Rachel Millner, a Twitter spokeswoman. LinkedIn users also said they visited the site less frequently, although a dedicated core of 13 percent said they went at least once a day. What the numbers don’t reveal was the time people spent on each service. Because most social networks generate revenue from advertising, more time on the service means a greater opportunity for visitors to see ads. But the researchers did learn that for the median Facebook user, two-thirds of his or her friends weren’t “actual” friends at all. And less than half of adult Facebook users have friended their parents or children on the service.\\n\\n\\nCash collection can make the difference between life and death for a Saas business: how does one achieve rapid growth in a SaaS business while maintaining capital efficiency? By focusing on the timing of cash collection, not just cash spend. The timing of cash collection can drastically influence the cash consumption of a high-growth, recurring-revenue business significantly beyond what one would intuitively assume. This ultimately has implications on the attractiveness of a business or, at a minimum, the level of shareholder dilution it experiences over time and will become an increasing area of focus as the period of cheap growth capital slowly comes to an end. Let’s take two hypothetical early-to-mid stage, high-growth, recurring-revenue SaaS businesses and model them over a five-year period. We assume each company admirably grows annual GAAP revenue from $2M-$6M-$13M-$28M-$53M and enjoys a 100 percent annual renewal rate. Both companies have identical aggregate cost structures that are well over 100 percent of revenue, which is benchmarked on dozens of recent high-growth SaaS businesses we’ve evaluated or invested in, or that have gone public. As illustrated below, the two companies thus have identical GAAP bookings, revenues and operating income. The only difference is that the first company, Company M (“monthly”), is like most SaaS companies in that it gets paid cash monthly and ratably over the one year contract period. The second company, Company A (“advance”), collects the full annual contracted value in advance. The difference in cash consumption between the two companies is staggering. Company A would have burned $36 million less cash over the five-year period due to growing deferred revenue balances, to achieve the exact same revenue and bookings trajectory as Company M. This gap in cash consumption can be the difference between success and bankruptcy or moderate versus significant dilution for the founders and early investors. Company M burned more than three times the amount of capital as compared to Company A despite identical bookings, revenue growth and operating expenses. Who can afford to ignore this?\\n\\n\\nTwitter Product Update #1: Twitter Will Launch Autoplay Video, but Here\\'s How It Will Differ From Facebook Marketers have 6 seconds to entice users to click. Twitter is about to give marketers new ways to share videos with a feature the ad world has been asking for: autoplay. Twitter has been working on its built-in video system for months, which would finally give users and marketers a way to shoot footage within the app. However, the video capabilities will be different for users and brands. We spoke with industry insiders who saw Twitter\\'s video pitch at CES, and here\\'s what it will look like: Six-seconds to wow The autoplay feature allows marketers to create a six-second video preview, a quick opportunity to entice users to click. Choose wisely The six-second preview, however, does not have to be the first six of the video. Brands can take the best six seconds, the most captivating, and use that as the autoplay preview. Everyone knows that getting clicks on video is all about an exciting hook from the start. No sound to start The autoplay video will not have sound until a user clicks to watch the promoted tweet. Advertisers don\\'t pay until they get that click. There\\'s a lot of time to play with Brands will be offered up to 10 minutes of video time, which is an eternity in social media. Everyday users will only get 30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nTwitter Product Update #2: Twitter Plans To Increase Revenue With Ads On Publisher’s Apps: Twitter reportedly has a new advertising strategy – sell ads within third-party apps.

The social media company is planning to sell ads within streams of tweets on other publishers’ apps and websites.” It isn’t clear which publishers have signed up so far.

The fresh funding comes just three months after the firm grabbed $30 million (Rs 181 crore) in Series E round of funding from existing investor Tiger Global Management. This is Google Capital’s second investment in India following its investment in SaaS-based customer support solutions startup Freshdesk Inc in mid-2014 and the third ever in Asia. So far, since its launch in the summer of 2013, Google Capital has made just ten bets, seven of them in the US. The only ones outside America are Chinese optical components maker Innolight, India’s cloud-based customer support software maker Freshdesk, which is headquartered in San Francisco, and now CommonFloor. A lowering of home loan rates, a relaxation of FDI (foreign direct investment) in construction, and an improvement in business sentiment after a new government took over in India last year have given the real estate sector a boost.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple’s Cut From App Sales Reached $4.5 Billion in 2014: Apple continues to make billions of dollars from mobile apps sold in its App Store. The company said on Thursday that in 2014, billings from app sales rose 50 percent from the previous year, which results in roughly $15 billion in revenue for app developers and a $4.5 billion cut for Apple. Apple takes a 30-percent cut of each app sale made in its App Store. The $4.5 billion sum is a tiny sliver for Apple, which makes more than $180 billion in annual sales. But it is still a considerable sum for providing a storefront for developers to sell their apps. By comparison, Google’s Android is the largest mobile operating system in the world, but its app store, Google Play, generates far less money than Apple’s. That’s partly because Apple’s iPhone customers are wealthier and spend more money than people who own Android phones. App Annie, an analytics firm that tracks mobile app sales, said that in the third quarter of 2014, Apple’s App Store revenue was 60 percent higher than revenue generated from Google Play. App Annie said it had not yet released numbers for annual sales for Google Play. In June 2014, Google said it had paid out $5 billion to developers in the previous 12 months. Gina Johnson, a Google spokeswoman, said the company did not have newer statistics to share. Apple said its App Store serves 1.4 million apps for iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices. Google Play hosts 1.72 million apps, according to App Annie.\\n\\n\\nActivist investor urges Yahoo to dispose Alibaba stake in a tax-efficient manner and return money to shareholders - CEO Mayer seeks to spend and expand instead: In the letter, addressed to Mayer from Starboard CEO Jeffrey Smith, the investor said it had become “increasingly concerned” by reports that the Web portal is looking to make major acquisitions. He reiterated that Yahoo should unlock value by monetizing assets -- which include stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan Corp. -- trimming costs and exploring a combination with AOL Inc. Starboard owned less than 1 percent of Yahoo, or about 7.7 million shares, as of September 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Yahoo’s performance has been increasingly in the spotlight since the initial public offering of Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba in September. Yahoo owned about a 24 percent piece of Alibaba, which had driven much of the Silicon Valley company’s value. Yahoo reaped a one-time boost of more than $9 billion before taxes from selling some Alibaba shares in the IPO and still retains a valuable stake of about 15 percent of the Chinese company. How Yahoo treats that stake has become a major debate, with options including a cash-rich split-off and a tax-efficient spinoff, among others. Starboard expressed “concerns” that Yahoo has made no announcement for a tax-efficient separation of the equity assets and criticized the possibility of a cash-rich split-off structure for those assets as unnecessarily complex. Starboard has spoken with large Yahoo shareholders, who also prefer a tax-efficient spinoff over a cash-rich split-off. In addition, he said Yahoo “must significantly reduce costs to improve profitability in its core business and should be considering a combination with AOL.” “Starboard has a point,” said Brett Harriss, an analyst at Gabelli & Co., who has a buy rating on Yahoo. “There are a lot of acquisitions that haven’t generated any financial returns.” He added that there’s a concern that Mayer is “not a steward of shareholder capital.”\\n\\n\\nMessaging continues to rise as an eCommerce Platform: Line Launches A Taxi Booking Service In Japan Because Chat Apps Have Become Platforms Line Taxi is built into the existing Line app, just like its recently introduced payments service, and its launch pits the company against dominant player Uber and British rival Hailo. A messaging app integrating a taxi app might sound an odd pairing, but it has been done before. China’s top chat app WeChat tied up with taxi on-demand service Didi Dache last year and there’s been talk of Facebook Messenger integrating with Uber — a chat app launching its own taxi service is something unique, however. Line Japan has introduced taxi booking this week, but it also has plans for on-demand food delivery, it has its own maps app which could support online-to-offline commerce for retailers, and it is dabbling in social commerce too. There are also plans for a music streaming service — which will be global thanks to Line’s acquisition of MixRadio from Microsoft — and more than 30 apps and games are tied into its core chat service. Line isn’t alone in building out its messaging experience. WeChat is doing the same in China. This week parent company Tencent launched an online bank — WeBank — which is likely to become a focus of its messaging platform, alongside existing pushes into retail, payments, taxi-hailing and more.\\n\\n\\nFacebook acquires a video startup that enhances low-bandwidth video-viewing and reduces buffering of videos without degradation in quality: Facebook has a acquired QuickFire Networks, a TC Disrupt 2014 Battlefield contestant that built a custom hardware and software platform for reducing video file sizes and upload times. The Wall Street Journal got the news earlier today, with confirmation later arriving on QuickFire’s site. QuickFire’s tech speeds up encoding videos with different profiles for frame rate, resolution, color and audio settings for different platforms. QuickFire’s solution relied on custom motherboards built to accommodate 11 high-end Intel Core i7 processors. Custom software let these processors work in unison, and a layer on top of that let the startup massively scale up by distributing work among multiple motherboards. For users, the end result of Facebook integrating QuickFire’s tech would be reduced buffering of videos without degradation in quality.\\n\\n\\nQuick win for companies on customer support? Pay attention to tweets of complaint: Two new reports – one from cloud-based customer care software maker Freshdesk, and another from tech research firm Gartner – suggest that even the top global brands are doing an amazingly poor job of engaging with their customers on new age channels like social media and mobile. Freshdesk looked at the top 100 brands of 2014, according to consultancy firm Interbrand, and analyzed how they engaged with customers on Twitter during the week leading up to the holidays: December 15 – 22. And this is what it found: The top 100 brands on average responded to just 22 percent of tweets directed at them. These 100 brands each got 1,000 tweets a week on average, but only 37 of them have a dedicated handle to listen to customers.  There were exceptions to this, but mostly in America – Samsung Support USA which goes by the handle @SamsungSupport responded to nearly all their tweets, as did @AskAmex for American Express, while @AdobeCare responded to a tweet in 26 minutes on average\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSamsung expects\\xa0revenue down 12% Y/Y, operating profit down 40% Y/Y in OND\\xa0as smartphone marketshare slumps;\\xa0stock is up 1% though - on semiconductor business strength, Won weakness: \\xa0Thursday, Samsung said it operating profit and revenue probably fell almost 40 % and 12%  in October to December 2014 compared with the same period in 2013. Marking the fifth consecutive quarter of decline in operating profit, Samsung’s forecast reflected continuing troubles for the company’s mobile division. Though it makes more smartphones than any other company, Samsung has had difficulty competing with a swarm of new Chinese rivals, which are offering ever more competitive phones at cheap prices in their home market, now the world’s largest for smartphones. In the period from July to September, Samsung’s global market share for smartphone sales fell 8 percent from the same period a year earlier to 24 percent, according to the research firm IDC. The only handset vendor in the top five to lose market share, Samsung is a sharp contrast to the Chinese upstart Xiaomi, which saw its market share jump 211 percent during the same period. Final fourth-quarter results are expected to be released at the end of January. \\n\\n\\nBad news for Google #1: US Search Marketshare at lowest level in years on Firefox\\'s switch to Yahoo: Google dominance of the U.S. Internet search market slipped last month in the biggest drop since 2009 while Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) posted its largest share gain, as the companies grappled with the fallout of a search deal on Firefox browsers. Google’s slice of the U.S. search market fell to 75.2 percent in December from 79.3 percent a year ago, while Yahoo jumped to 10.4 percent from 7.4 percent, according to analytics firm StatCounter. That put Google at its smallest share of the U.S. Web search market since at least 2008, when StatCounter first started tracking the numbers, and the highest share for Yahoo since 2009. The changes were spurred by a deal in November where Yahoo replaced Google as the default search engine on Firefox browers in the U.S. Google had been the automatic search option for Firefox, which was developed by Mountain View, California-based Mozilla Corp., since 2004. \\n\\n\\nBad news for Google #2: Facebook video is freaking YouTube out (Also, 65% of Facebook\\'s Video Views Are Now on Mobile Devices) Here are the other numbers the Menlo Park, Calif.-based company released in a blog post: In the last 12 months, the number of video posts per Facebook user has increased 75 percent globally and 94 percent in the United States. Internationally, clips from consumers and marketers in the newsfeed have risen 3.6 times year over year. On average, more than 50 percent of U.S. users who visit Facebook daily watch at least one video. From a HawkPartners study commissioned by Facebook that surveyed 2,418 Facebook users in the U.S., 76 percent said Facebook is the place where they most often discover videos. Other choices included YouTube, \"directly from a friend,\" Google, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest and others.  While self-reported, the numbers lend themselves to a narrative that emerged at the end of 2014: Facebook has given Google\\'s YouTube serious cause for concern after the latter dominated the online video space for years. Facebook is also evidently attempting to poach YouTube talent. \"Google is freaking out,\" a media agency executive recently told Adweek.\\n\\n\\nBad news for Google #3: A TechCrunch columnist rips YouTube\\'s product as stagnant and compares it to Yahoo: The great story of Silicon Valley: A company, once ahead of its time, ceases to innovate for almost a decade while continuing to make billions off its legacy business model — ad sales. Then that once-great company dies. In the proud American tradition of AOL, Yahoo, and GeoCities, I present YouTube. Ever notice how its homepage looks almost the same as it did in 2008? For the first time in a decade, YouTube’s dominance as the destination for video content is being challenged by rivals like Facebook. While the press admires the success of Bethany Mota and tours the lush new coastal YouTube studios, Facebook has spotted the company’s many weaknesses and is going on the attack 1. The dominant image is an advertisement (gross). 2. I have no interest in any of that recommended content. 3. I have no idea how that content surfaced to my main pain in the first place, which makes me think YouTube is kinda dumb. 4. I have no way to feed back into YouTube’s algorithm and say I hate their content, as suggested, for “me.” 5. The content is presented void of any context. How about some editorial, ratings, written jokes, or any other myriad ways that it could be made more meaningful? 6. Even BuzzFeed knows point No. 5, and they are the intellectual toilet of the Internet. Fix: Copy the Gawker “bored at work” business model; hire some editors. YouTube should challenge itself to perform more like BuzzFeed, which, for all its faults, does immediately engage the user off of its homepage content and context.\\n\\n\\nCES loses its lustre - as smartphones lead, consumer electronics follow: “Today, what every customer expects is for their device to be a platform”: Technology fanatics descend every January on Las Vegas for the International CES, a colossal gathering of gadgetry and geekery where some of the world’s largest companies show off their best ideas for the future. This year, as in every recent year, the show has been burdened by existential angst, with many tech writers saying they planned to skip an event no longer seen as vital. It has been ages since anything momentous was unveiled at CES. But the travails of CES are a symptom of a larger transformation in tech. The era dominated by consumer electronics — what most of us call gadgets — is in turmoil. One reason is that many devices have been superseded by a single, all-powerful tool: the smartphone. Today, just about everything that once required a small, dedicated electronic device — from cameras to portable game consoles to GPS navigators to music players to too many others to name — works better as an app on a phone. At the same time, smartphones have created new categories of capabilities that have eclipsed gadgets as the tech industry’s center of energy and innovation. Photo apps like Instagram, messaging companies like WhatsApp and Snapchat, transportation systems like Uber and Lyft, and Apple Pay, the wireless payment system created by a company best known for its hardware. These services, powered by smart software, use our phones’ constant connection to the cloud, and their powers to connect us with one another, to create tech experiences that wouldn’t have been possible with the gadgets of yesteryear. None of them would ever have graced a stage at CES, because none of these things are really gadgets; they’re way more exciting than that. Here’s the important lesson for consumer electronics companies: The future of tech may not be in flashier, more powerful hardware, but instead in services enabled by clever software. The gadgets matter, but only if they allow for software that can create useful, perhaps groundbreaking services that work across all our gadgets. “Today, what every customer expects is for their device to be a platform,”\\n\\n\\nIndia tech action: social/messaging product features are going mainstream: CommonFloor acqui-hires a college hyperlocal network, and Quikr adds instant messaging to its mobile app: CommonFloor.com has acqui-hired Bakfy, a hyper local Twitter-like social app for college campuses, from city-based Nativebeta Pvt Ltd in a cash-cum-equity deal. As per the agreement, Bakfy team will join CommonFloor as Entrepreneurs-in-Residence (EIRs), and will work closely with its founders to build products at the intersection of social and mobile. Bakfy is a mobile app that connects different college campus. It acts as a local Twitter for campuses where students can chit-chat about the daily happenings in their campuses or on any other topics. Bakfy puts the entire college under one roof, without any friend requests. It also connects disconnected colleges by providing an option to post to other college campuses. Students can also post anonymously and share stuff, which they can’t do on Facebook, WhatsApp, etc. Typical use cases are gossip about day-to-day stuff, information sharing, college events/fests, jobs/internships, share secrets/feelings, share exam notes, etc. Bakfy is live in over 50 colleges across India. The startup was backed by Yogender Chhibber of Zinnov Management Consulting. Quikr has added instant messaging feature to its classifieds site Quikr.com that allows buyers and sellers to connect with each other. Named Quikr Nxt, the feature enables users to chat with multiple users and share images. Offline consumers get a notification so that they can chat once they are back online. Users can safeguard their privacy by opting to not share their mobile numbers. The new feature is also available on its mobile apps. Last September, Quikr had secured $60 million in funding from Tiger Global, Matrix Partners, Nokia Growth Partners, Norwest Venture Partners, Omidyar Network, Warburg Pincus and eBay Inc, besides Swedish investment firm Kinnevik. It competes with the likes of OLX among others.\\n\\n\\nSmall/Specialty Retailers were big winners in US December 2014 eCommerce sales analyzed by respected blog ChannelAdvisor: Other Winners: Amazon, Google Product Listing AdsLosers: eBay, Google Search:  December  2014 Same Store Sales Results Amazon - Amazon’s December SSS came in at 21.8%,  a decrease compared to November’s 35.7% . eBay -  eBay’s December came in at 5.8% down from November’s 9.8% and below the e-commerce growth rate.  Further in the report, we have details of the eBay internals. Other 3PM -3PM continued strong growth in December coming in at 28.5% a decrease from November’s 41.6%.  CSE - Comparison Shopping Engines came in at -2.3% for December down from November’s 12.3%.  This was largely driven by weakness in the traditional CSE segment that overshadowed strength in Google Shopping / PLA (details later). Search - Search came in at 9.4% for December a decrease from November’s 15.6% y/y growth.  Later in the report we have more search details. The winning channels (those that grew in-line or ahead of this trend line) were: Other 3PM – Other 3PM grew more than 2X the baseline holiday growth rate, coming in at 34% y/y this year; and the fastest-growing e-commerce channel we track.  I always get questions on this one so will restate here that ‘Other 3PM’ includes those marketplaces that are not eBay and Amazon such as NewEgg, Sears, BestBuy, Rakuten, Play, LaRadoute, etc.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter stellar year, Facebook stock finds doubters on rising opex, slowing growth (2015F 37% Y/Y, 2014F 57% Y/Y) :\\xa0Facebook, up 195 percent in two years and trading at a record last month, is starting to draw skeptics in the options market. Options betting on a decline in Facebook cost the most versus bullish contracts since July 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Options with an exercise price 10 percent below the shares cost 3.1 points more than calls and climbed to 3.3 points above on Dec. 23, according to three-month implied-volatility data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with the one-year average of 1.3 points.  “We’re not banking on seeing Facebook repeat the same great performance it had in 2014,” said Uppington, a technology portfolio manager at Lombard Odier in Geneva. His company oversees $50 billion. “It’s also seeing an increase in operating expenses. The company needs to invest in growth to overcome the law of large numbers.” Operating expenses rose in the third quarter at the fastest pace since the first three months of 2013, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Menlo Park, California-based company has purchased applications such as Instagram and WhatsApp Inc. to increase its appeal to younger users and drive mobile advertising sales. Now analysts predict profit and revenue growth in 2015 won’t keep pace with the increases from last year. Facebook earnings will gain 12 percent this year after nearly doubling in 2014, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales will climb 37 percent after rising 57 percent last year, the projections show.\\n\\n\\nCan Apple Do for Wearable Ads What Facebook Did for Mobile? Marketers predict brands will latch onto smartwatches  TapSense this week unveiled what its programmatic ads for the soon-to-be-released Apple Watch will look like, exhibiting a buy-one-get-one-free mock offer from Starbucks. It\\'s at least the second tech company to reveal a programmatic offering for wearables in the last few months, coming on the heels of FitAd\\'s debut with Amtrak. This will be a space to watch in 2015—especially if Apple Watch becomes remotely close to as popular as the iPhone. Wearable device sales are generally expected to achieve significant growth over the next few years, according to researchers. Rest assured, marketers will pay to test return on investment with the emerging formats, and the additional revenue stream could be a boon to CEO Tim Cook\\'s company. \"Apple has the opportunity to seize this market of wearable ads, just like Facebook has seized mobile,\" said Esha Shah, manager of mobile strategy and innovation at Fetch. \"Hyper-local ads and coupons could be part of that, as should larger ad opportunities, like voice-based mobile search,\" he added. Indeed, advertisements on one\\'s wrist seem ripe for direct-response opportunities.\\n\\n\\nGlassdoor raises $70M, valuation ~ $1B, preps for IPO: Glassdoor Inc, the operator of jobs website Glassdoor.com, said it raised $70 million from Google Capital and existing investors Tiger Global, Battery Ventures and Sutter Hill Ventures. Glassdoor, whose rivals include Monster Worldwide Inc, said it had raised about $160 million so far. Glassdoor has a valuation of close to $1 billion and is planning for an initial public offering, the Wall Street Journal said.  Glassdoor said it had more than 27 million registered members worldwide. The company has over 2,000 employer clients including Groupon Inc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Facebook Inc, Chevron Corp, Procter & Gamble Co and Twitter Inc. Glassdoor raised $50 million in December 2013 from a group led by Tiger Global.\\n\\n\\nPayments story#1: Kickstarter abandons Amazon as payment processor, opts for Stripe instead: Crowdsourced fundraising site Kickstarter has dropped Amazon.com Inc as its global payments processor in favor of Stripe, the fast-growing startup used by Twitter Inc, Facebook Inc and Apple Inc. The switch comes as the Internet retailer begins to move clients from its customizable checkout service to an Amazon-branded one. In a blog post on Tuesday, Kickstarter said it made the switch after Amazon decided to drop its Flexible Payments Service, which allows a company to develop its own checkout process. The new Amazon-branded Login and Pay service does not offer as much flexibility. Some analysts have said Amazon has been held back in payments because merchants are wary of handing over customer data to the company, which is rapidly expanding into new areas and competing with sellers. In early December, Stripe raised $70 million from Sequoia Capital and other investors that valued the startup at $3.5 billion, double from a year earlier.\\n\\n\\nPayments story #2: Rocket ties up with Philippines telco for payments solution in SE Asia: Ecommerce giant Rocket Internet and Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) today took a big step towards their goal of becoming a strong contender in online payments in the region. In a joint statement, the companies announced they’ve inked an agreement to form a 50-50 joint venture for online and mobile payment solutions, with a focus on emerging markets. This follows PLDT’s US$445 million investment in the Germany-based startup incubator. The joint venture particularly targets Rocket Internet’s ecommerce operations under brands such as Zalora and Lazada in Southeast Asia. Prior to this deal, the companies had begun making use of PLDT’s MePay. MePay is a payment service for shopping on Zalora’s site without a credit card.\\n\\n\\nBig news in the US TV Market: Dish to launch Sling TV, a web TV service: What is Sling TV? Sling TV is a service by Dish Network, one of the country\\'s largest satellite TV providers. When it officially goes online in a few weeks, it will cost $20 a month. For that you\\'ll get access to about 30 channels — including TNT, Cartoon Network and CNN. These channels will be streamable over the Internet — or \"over the top,\" in industry parlance. But the real kicker is that Dish is throwing in ESPN (more on that in a second). Why is Dish launching something like this? Dish wants to go after cord-cutters — a growing segment of TV watchers who don\\'t subscribe to pay-TV and instead watch only free, over-the-air television, on-demand services like Netflix, or a mix of both. The drawback to being a cord-cutter is that you sometimes sacrifice channel choices. You don\\'t get to watch HBO, for example, if you\\'re a cord-cutter. But many people, particularly young viewers, don\\'t seem to mind — and that\\'s a problem for traditional pay-TV companies. What\\'s the big deal about ESPN? Live sports is pretty much the foundation for all paid television. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

Wit.ai already has 6,000 developers on its platform who have built hundreds of apps. Wit.ai’s platform will remain open and free, which makes it seem that Facebook wants to use the technology to draw developers into its Build-Grow-Monetize loop where they get help building apps, but eventually pay Facebook for ads to grow or monetize by splitting revenue with Facebook from hosting its ads. As part of Facebook, Wit.ai could help the company offer voice control development tools alongside its Parse development platform, aid with voice-to-text input for Messenger, improve Facebook’s understanding of the semantic meaning of voice, and create a Facebook app you can navigate through speech. The Wit.ai product lets developers add a few lines of its code to instantly build in speech recognition and voice control. Without it, developers would need the expertise, time and resources to build a whole voice-recognition system themselves.\\n\\n\\nStart-ups, giants rush to break down ‘Deep-Linking’ walls between Apps and Web: Unlike web pages, mobile apps do not have links. They do not have web addresses. They live in worlds by themselves, largely cut off from one another and the broader Internet. And so it is much harder to share the information found on them. Say you want a hotel for a weekend stay. You could Google for deals or go to a travel site. But wherever you go on the web, you will not find the rooms on HotelTonight, an app that offers steep discounts for last-minute bookings. The only way to get those listings is to use the app. And if you find a few hotels on HotelTonight, you cannot email them to your spouse, because there are no links to send. As people spend more time on their mobile devices and in their apps, their Internet has taken a step backward, becoming more isolated, more disorganized and ultimately harder to use — more like the web before search engines. In tech speak, the problem is known as “deep linking,” the technological hurdle of giving apps some sort of links — those identifying lines of letters, dots and slashes that make up a web address or URL. Though deep linking is a worry for large tech firms, it is a big opportunity for start-ups looking to unseat them.  For web giants, deep linking is a way to protect their businesses by creating mobile versions of things they do on the web. Take Google, which makes money helping people search the web. When people search in apps, it is mostly left out. And while the company has a fast-growing business selling apps through devices that use its Android operating system, that pales in comparison to its business selling search advertising. Google’s solution is App Indexing technology, a way to catalog app pages, letting Google’s search engine retrieve information from mobile applications as well as from web pages. Twitter has Twitter Cards, which make it possible to go from the Twitter app to another app in the user’s phone, rather than from the Twitter app to the web. If the user does not have the app he or she wants installed on a phone, Twitter will ask if the user wants to install it immediately. Facebook is trying to create an open standard of deep links to help apps connect to one another, so, for instance, someone could go from listening to a band in the Spotify app to finding information about the band’s live appearances in the Songkick app.\\n\\n\\n\"Unbundling\" is causing US eCommerce order values to fall, as consumers spread purchases across multiple transactions: While sales were up overall this year, order value was down 8 percent from 2013, with the average order costing $119.33. Experts say these offers can prompt shoppers to \"unbundle\" their orders, meaning that shoppers may spread out their purchases over several transactions instead of scooping up slippers for Mom and \"Frozen\" pajamas for the kids in one order. According to data released Monday by IBM, sales on mobile devices rose by 27 percent in November and December over the same period last year. And yet sales made through smartphones and tablets still only accounted for about 23 percent of online sales overall, with a whopping 77 percent of sales coming from desktops and laptops. IBM also studied how social sites Facebook and Pinterest drive retail sales. The analysis found that shoppers who came to retailer\\'s Web site through a Facebook post spent an average of $101.38 per order, while those who came from Pinterest spent $105.75.  Henderson said a key difference might be that Facebook included a mix of sponsored ads and posts from friends, while Pinterest did not contain ads, a sign that perhaps the more curated, trusted content from friends was more effective at driving sales.  (Pinterest began selling ads on Jan. 1, so that could sour some users\\' experience with the site in the future.) IBM found that total online sales were up a healthy 13.8 percent this holiday season compared to 2013, an uptick that was about in line with the 15 percent growth IBM had predicted.  This year\\'s increase was significantly larger than the 8.5 percent online sales increase recorded by IBM last year.\\n\\n\\nSnapdeal invests in comparison site Smartprix - follows investments in recommendation engine Wishpicker, discovery platform Doozton: Snapdeal, has quietly picked a stake in Smartprix Web Private Limited, which runs online product and price comparison site Smartprix, sources privy to the development told Techcircle.in. This comes as yet another strategic move for Snapdeal in acquiring or getting an exposure to third-party e-commerce enabling ventures over the last year or so. It had recently acquired gifting recommendation venture Wishpicker besides snapping fashion products discovery platform Doozton around a year ago. It is learnt that Snapdeal had initially acquired 10 per cent stake in Smartprix in FY14 with the understanding to acquire a majority stake eventually. “Snapdeal’s VP engineering Amitabh Misra had joined the board of Smartprix as one of the directors,” said one of the sources. Smartprix was founded in May 2011 by then IIT-Delhi students Choudhary and Khandelwal who have dual degree in computer science and engineering. Smartprix.com is an online comparison shopping that helps users compare different products and choose the best product according to their needs. It also presents the pricing information of the product on different online stores and provides review, ranking and recommendations. Its product categories include mobile phones, tablets, laptops, cameras personal care appliances, accessories and books. The firm also features deals on all kinds of products and plans to introduce newer categories. The firm earns commission from the affiliates for every sale. To date, it has tied up with over 50 online stores. Snapdeal is not the first firm to eye a piece of a product price comparison engine. Amazon already runs a India specific price comparison site called Junglee.com  There are several startups in the price comparison space, many of whom have managed to grab VC attention. Among these, Zopper.com raised $5 million led by Tiger Global Management LLC, PriceBag.com raised $2 million from angel investors, MySmartPrice raised $1 million from Accel and Helion, YouTellMe.com recently raised $100,000 from Dutch early-stage fund Bright Ventures, among others.\\n\\n\\nWhy did Amazon send 405 reps to CES 2014? Why did Apple send just 4? The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is one of largest trade shows around:\\xa0Amazon.com, the third-biggest consumer-electronics retailer in the U.S., sent 405 representatives to CES 2014. Apple, the fourth-biggest, sent four, according to the Consumer Electronics Association, which puts on the conference.Back in 2009, when Amazon was only eighth among U.S. electronics retailers, it sent 69 reps to the annual nerd festival. Apple, then the third-largest electronics retailer, also sent 69 that year. Apple hasn’t introduced a product at the dog and pony show in more than a decade—after debuting a series of flops there in the 1990s, including a video-game console and the Newton—but it had steadily increased its number of reps at CES from 2009 to 2011 as the company grew its retail operations. While Apple Stores mostly sell the company’s brand-name products, it does carry accessories from other hardware makers. U.S. electronics sales at Apple Stores last year rose to more than $11 billion, according to the Consumer Electronics Association. But for some reason, Apple cut its badge count to four in 2012, where it’s remained ever since. Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, Amazon, which also didn’t respond to a request for comment, sent more employees last year than Best Buy and Wal-Mart Stores, the top two gadget retailers. Amazon sells its own products, too, but it’s a retailer first and foremost. If CES’s influence in waning, nobody told Jeff Bezos.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXiaomi 2014 revenue ~$12B (+135% Y/Y), smartphone shipments up 227% Y/Y; Huawei 2014 revenue $46B (+15% Y/Y), smartphone shipments up 40% Y/Y Xiaomi booked 74.3 billion yuan ($11.97 billion) in pre-tax sales last year, up 135 percent from 2013, the firm\\'s chief executive Lei Jun said on his official microblog account on Sunday. Xiaomi sold a total of just over 61 million phones in 2014, up 227 percent from a year earlier, Lei added in a post on his Sina Weibo microblog account. The post did not give a related profit figure, although a filing last month showed that the firm was grappling with razor thin margins as it rapidly expands. A part of the business made around 347.5 million yuan net profit last year on revenue of 26.6 billion yuan and an operating margin of just 1.8 percent. Huawei: China\\'s Huawei says 2014 sales revenue to rise 15 percent to $46 billion. Huawei\\'s smartphone shipments rose by more than 40 percent last year, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters, failing to match its own target and the performance of faster-growing rivals such as Xiaomi. \\n\\n\\n\\nSeparately, Xiaomi announces the Redmi 2, an improved version of its sub-$150 smartphone: The company’s flagship Mi devices may attract all the attention, but the sub-$150 Redmi family is its biggest seller. Back in July of last year, Xiaomi revealed it had sold 18 million Redmi (/Hongmi as it is known in China) phones and 3.56 million Redmi Note phablets. The Redmi alone accounted for one-third of total sales at the time. The Redmi 2 keeps much of the original model’s ingredients. It has the same 4.7-inch, 1280 x 720 display, but under the hood there’s an upgraded 64-bit Qualcomm 410 quad-core processor. The device sports an 8-megapixel rear camera, improved 2-megapixel front camera, 1GB RAM and 8GB on-device storage. There is now dual 4G SIM support too. The Redmi 2 — which runs Xiaomi’s own MIUI version of Android — also gives a few more options for color-loving customers. ‘Lime green’ and ‘powder yellow’ are the new additions to the palette. The phone will cost 699 CNY, which is around $112, when it goes on sale on January 9. There’s no word on when it will be released outside of China, but you can be sure that the Redmi 2 will make its way to India, Indonesia and Xiaomi’s other overseas markets soon.\\n\\n\\nIBM\\'s stock is in a funk, and analysts call for the firm to invest in R&D rather than do share buy-backs: IBM requires an atypical activist fix. The company’s strategy of cost cuts and debt-fueled buybacks is no longer working – even though the company keeps trying. A tarnished balance sheet, lean staffing and a history of disposals rule out typical activist wheezes. Encouraging Virginia M. Rometty, the chairwoman and chief executive, to invest in IBM’s core businesses could pay off. IBM has run the same playbook for two decades. It sells low-margin businesses, cuts expenses, buys some profitable software companies and returns a lot of cash to investors. Over the last four quarters, the $152 billion company has spent more than $23 billion on dividends and buybacks. The problem is that IBM is investing too little. It has spent only about $11 billion over the last four quarters in total on research and development, capital expenditure and acquisitions. That’s a problem in technology, where old products soon become obsolete. Google spends about 16 percent of its sales on R.&D., but IBM spends 6 percent. The effect is becoming clear on the top line. Revenue has shrunk for 10 consecutive quarters. Costs have been cut to the bone, sending customers fleeing to better service providers. In a good year for stocks, IBM’s shares have fallen more than 15 percent. That means IBM has overpaid on its last three years of buybacks.\\n\\n\\nBig data firms are starting to focus on \\'unstructured data\\' that resides in presentations, memos and reports: data analysis is great if your information is in formats that are easy for computers to read, such as spreadsheets with numbers, or responses on a scale from one to five. But a lot of information isn\\'t organized like that. Instead, it\\'s in presentations, memos, reports, comments or just plain e-mail. Analysis of that kind of information -- often called \"unstructured\" or \"dark\" data -- is really tough to do by computer, and companies including Intel, SAP and HP are looking for a more reliable way to do it. Another firm, uReveal, thinks that it\\'s cracked the code. Charles \"Bucky\" Clarkson, uReveal\\'s chairman and CEO, said that software such as his makes it easier to to parse all those government reports and organize the data so that analysts can get more out of it, and more quickly. He also claims that the software is so simple to use that (gasp!) even liberal arts majors can use it.\\n\\n\\nTech patents are increasingly in the news: Story #1: Priceline.com\\'s founder attempts a marketplace for tech patents, and China announces plans to triple the number of patents filed by 2020: In 1997, Jay Walker founded Priceline.com — the Web site many people use to get cheaper airfare by \"naming your own price.\" Patenting the solution, and allowing others to use the patents for a fee, helped drive Walker\\'s success. But, Walker argues in an interview, many patents remain underused. Now, the man who smoothed transactions for buyers and sellers of airplane tickets wants to do something similar for a key part of the nation\\'s information economy. Walker is developing something called the United States Patent Utility.  \"We\\'re going to form a utility, which works as a neutral party for both inventors of technology and users of technology. So you would be listing your patents as available for use. Then the next thing we\\'re going to do is, we\\'re going to say to people who are small to medium sized companies, get on the phone with us and talk to us for about 10 or 15, 20 minutes and tell us about your products and services. Send us PDFs of your sales manuals, your technical literature we can ingest, and we\\'ll build a model of the technologies and products you use. If you\\'re a shoe manufacturer, we can take all your specifications, all your sales materials, and we can read it all into the system. And then what we do is use a set of Big Data algorithms to take your specifications of all your products and services and run it up against the entire U.S. database of patents, which is about 2-plus million active patents. We run it against all the inactive patents, all the expired patents. Think of it as a natural-language kind of way. You don\\'t need to be a programmer any more for it to run up against the entire database.\\n\\n\\nTech patents are increasingly in the news: Story #2: China announces plans to triple the number of patents filed by 2020:  China is aiming to triple the number of patents it files by 2020 as Beijing looks to boost the country\\'s high-tech economy in areas from agriculture to pharmaceuticals, according to a notice from the central government on Sunday. China is targeting 14 invention patents per 10,000 habitants by 2020 compared to four in 2013. It published 629,612 patents in 2013, over 200,000 more than the United States, according to a Thomson Reuters study in December. Beijing is also looking to reduce the length of the review process for patent and trademark applications. Patent reviews will decline to 20.2 months in 2020 from 22.3 months in 2013, while trademark reviews will fall to 9 months from 10 months. \"Intellectual property (IP) is increasingly becoming a vital component of China\\'s strategic resources and competitive ability,\" the statement posted on the Central People\\'s Government website said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSnapchat is raising funds in an unusual manner -\\xa0has raised $485M from >23 Investors since April 2014, valuation >$10B, 200M MAU:\\xa0 “[Snapchat] goes after individual investors at different valuations. It’s a rolling investment and a rolling close. In theory you could say he’s already done 40 rounds.” (40 is likely figurative rather than literal.) What this means is that, if it’s true, then yes, Snapchat may have raised nearly $500 million in the last six months. Of that $500 million, it may be that only 75% of it is closed, and with portions at different valuations, some getting in pre-$10-billion, like Yahoo, and some above it and closer to $20 billion.The SEC filing notes that the date of first sale was in April 2014. We’ve also heard that the current post money valuation is $20 billion, although others have disputed this and said it’s closer to $10 billion. The cash is much-needed. One source said that Snapchat has an over $30 million-per-year burn rate, and pays half of that to Google Apps Engine to host all its photos, though this number seems low to us. Another noted that at one point the company was paying $3 million each month in legal fees alone. Snapchat’s had its share of lawsuits. Monthly Active Users are now at 200M, up from 100M in August. Amazon was not one of the investors in this round\\n\\n\\n\\'While you were away\\' - Twitter\\'s recap feature is rolling out to significant numbers of users: ‘While you were away’ works much like Facebook’s Timeline and is the first major non-chronological feature to hit Twitter. Back in November, the company said it would look at the ‘best’ tweets from your network since you last opened Twitter, and put them at the top of your timeline so you don’t miss them. The algorithm that Twitter uses to source your ‘best’ tweets from your friends is crucial to its success. As someone who doesn’t use Twitter every minute of every day, I’d appreciate a recap but only if it is able to surface content that is relevant and interesting to me. There are already some services that exist solely to do that, while Twitter has email alerts for the purpose too. Nuzzel, for example, taps into your Facebook and Twitter network to surface news stories and other items that are popular with people you know. I’m skeptical that Twitter’s feature can be as effective, particularly since it only serves up a single tweet and that takes up precious real-estate at the top of your feed. Nonetheless, the addition looks like it will be more useful for users than many of Twitter’s recent features — which include sponsored accounts appearing in following lists, tweets from people you don’t follow in your timeline, and a test that meddled with the retweet button.\\n\\n\\nVMWare, Workday testing a data-driven technology to predict employee attrition:  VMware has been testing a new prediction technology from Workday, which makes software for human resources departments. The system delivers notifications about when employees might be getting ready to quit, and allows managers to intervene before it\\'s too late. It looks for trends within employee activity, when promotions were last handed out, regional factors, changes in the industry and other data to make its predictions. The recommendations can improve over time as employers train the system. \"We\\'ve had some great results to date with the data,” Amy Gannaway, VMware’s senior director for worldwide human resources information systems, said at a Workday conference in September. The tool gave VMware \"a very high percentage\" of accurate predictions for which employees would leave the company, she said.\\n\\n\\nThe Indian Railways will soon launch an iOS app, as mobile travel bookings are surging in India: According to a report by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) and IMRB International, the number of mobile Internet users has witnessed a steady rise to 159 million in October. This is estimated to reach 173 million by the end of December. There were 119 million users in urban India accessing the Internet on mobile devices in October. Rural India is not that far behind, with a base of 40 million mobile Internet users in October 2013. Indian Railways, which has the largest share in online bookings, is witnessing surge of mobile bookings as well. According to sources at IRCTC, its mobile ticket booking app receives 8,000-9,000 bookings a day through mobiles. The numbers are low compared with the 600,000 tickets booked online every day, but officials say they expect this segment to grow. \"Our mobile app has been downloaded 15,00,000 times on the Windows platform. On Android it has been downloaded 10,00,000 times. In a month\\'s time we will be launching an app for iOS too,\" says a senior official on condition of anonymity.\\n\\n\\nThe 10 Most Innovative Digital Ad Products of 2014: (1) Google Shopping Campaigns took on Amazon with Product Listing Ads in early 2014, and then AdSense for Shopping, which shows product ads on third-party websites, in September 2014. (2) Snapchat\\'s sponsored updates and live feed, which crowdsources Snapchat messages at events like the Macy\\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade, now features commercials mixed in with the snaps from everyday users. For instance, Amazon sponsored Black Friday on Snapchat. (3) Instagram\\'s autoplay sponsored videos, and brands from Disney to Electronic Arts to Banana Republic were the first to try them out. The video offering comes on top of sponsored photos, which were first served in 2013. (4) Facebook\\'s Premium Video Ads didn\\'t fully launch until March. These ads are autoplaying videos that are attracting a number of brands such as Macy\\'s during Christmas. Video is the future of Facebook, according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and billions of videos from users and marketers are seen everyday.(5) Twitter\\'s app-install ads and e-commerce ads that have Buy Now buttons and video ads with View Now, and the list of potential actions is only growing. (6) Tumblr Sponsored Dot: Tumblr was full of new ad ideas this year, perhaps the most intriguing was the Sponsored Dot (that period at the end of its logo). Now, brands can buy it, dressing their logo as the punctuation mark for special occasions, like Starbucks did on National Coffee Day. (7) Kik Promoted Chats: The paid chats launched this year and let properties like Funny or Die and electronics brands like Skullcandy to message one-on-one with followers who opt in. It\\'s a new kind of marketing built for mobile and messaging, two increasingly relevant areas. (8) Pinterest\\'s Promoted Pins are the platform\\'s first ad product, which launched fully earlier this year after being tested in late 2013. Brands like Kraft, Dell, Home Depot and Walmart are paying to boost their Pins, and there are now self-serve tools, too, for managing marketing campaigns on the platform. (9) Pandora\\'s Sponsored Listening product, which offers users ad-free listening for an hour in return for watching a sponsored clip. In October, Fox helped promote new shows on Pandora with the help of the format. (10) Google Giferator:  shows that Google is allowing advertisers to be more creative on the digital platform. The Giferator was generating dynamic ads in real time that could be highly targeted to select audiences. The ad technology was developed as part of Google\\'s Art, Copy and Code program, where it tries to blend the creative and technical sides of digital advertising. Also, the Giferator let users create their own Gifs, a format that marketers couldn\\'t get enough of this year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGrocery delivery startup Instacart is now valued at over $2B: Instacart has raised an additional $210 million, according to an SEC filing on Monday.

The truth is only about 1 percent of commerce happens on mobile today, which is hard to believe considering there are now more mobile devices than people in the world. But I think that’s all about to change, and authentication is going to be an even bigger driver in mobile shopping and conversion in 2015.\"\\n\\n\\nGood news for Chinese smartphone brands: Taiwan clears Xiaomi, others  of breaching data privacy:\\xa0In September, Taiwan\\'s government began performing independent tests on Xiaomi phones after media reports said that some models automatically send user data back to the firm\\'s servers in mainland China. Taiwanese regulators cleared on Tuesday Xiaomi and other smartphone brands of breaching local data protection laws after national security concerns triggered that proble. The probe, which also involved Chinese handset makers Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and ZTE Corp, was a reminder of the scrutiny Chinese technology firms are subject to abroad as governments become increasingly wary of potential cyber security threats from the world\\'s second-biggest economy. Privately owned Xiaomi, whose budget smartphones are popular throughout Asia, was previously accused of breaching data privacy. In August, the company apologized and said it would change a default feature after a Finnish security company said Xiaomi collected address book data without users\\' permission.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nUber must add \\'panic buttons\\' to operate in Delhi:  Taxi firms including Uber, the online cab-hailing company banned in New Delhi, will have to install panic buttons if they are to operate in India\\'s capital under new rules framed after allegations that a driver for the U.S. firm raped a passenger.The Delhi government now wants all taxi operators, including aggregators such as Uber, to have a fleet of taxis running on clean fuels and fitted with tracking devices and emergency buttons. \"The licensee shall ensure the facility of a panic button in the radio taxi so that in case of any distress, the signal is transmitted to the control center of the licensee and therefrom, to the nearest police station/police control room,\" Delhi\\'s transport office said on its website.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChina blocks Gmail..:The Gmail blocking began on Friday and has ignited anger and frustration among many Internet users in China. Data from Google shows traffic to Gmail dropping to zero from Chinese servers. But it is not just a matter of convenience for Chinese Internet users. Some foreign companies use Gmail as their corporate email service, for example, and so companies will have to ensure that employees have V.P.N., or virtual private network, software to get into Gmail. Google is not the only company to be censored inside China. Facebook, the world’s largest social network, is essentially blocked there. Its Instagram photo-sharing service was briefly blocked this fall when pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong began using it to share photos with mainland Chinese users. When LinkedIn began offering a Chinese-language version of its business social network this year, it had to agree to censor content seen by Chinese users. This time, Gmail appeared to have been singled out. Representatives for Yahoo and Microsoft said on Monday that the companies had heard no complaints from users in China about their email services being blocked.\\n\\n\\n...and Google Search too: It isn\\'t just Gmail. The government of China, which this weekend launched a tweak to its Great Firewall filtering regime that blocked much of mainland China\\'s access to Google\\'s e-mail service, has on Monday cut off access nationwide to Google Search as well, reports one Internet intelligence expert. And, says Earl Zmijewski, vice president of data analytics at the New Hampshire firm Dyn, the changes aren\\'t the result of some accidental misconfiguration by a ham-handed government engineer in some backwater office somewhere. \"This was deliberate,\" Zmijewski says. \"It was pushed out to the whole country at once. Google and the Chinese government have long been at odds, with Google choosing to stop basing operations in mainland China in 2009 in response to Beijing\\'s efforts at censorship. Google has chosen instead to offer services to mainland Chinese using servers located in Hong Kong. (In normal practice, Google attempts to route users to the servers located the closest to them, or otherwise most quickly accessible; a user in New Hampshire, for example, might be routed to New York.) But this week\\'s actions suggest a raising of the Great Firewall specifically to cut that passageway between the Chinese people and Google\\'s services in Hong Kong. Beijing is using the bluntest instrument it has available to it to keep Google out, and isn\\'t worried much about who knows it. Simple blocking of Internet protocol, or IP, addresses is the \"easiest and crudest\" method that China has for maintaining the effectiveness of its Great Firewall. Beijing also uses so-called \"DNS poisoning,\" or the takeover of the address tables that govern the Internet so that a user who types, say, Twitter.com into her browser window is misdirected to another Web site. And then there\\'s deep packet inspection, such as blocking online references to terms like \"Falun Gong\" or \"Dalai Lama.\" But those methods can be technologically tricky and expensive.\\n\\n\\nFacebook’s popularity among teens dips again, but Instagram is now worth $35B (35x in 2 years), sending Facebook stock to a record high: A report yesterday by Frank N. Magid Associates Inc. found that the portion of 13- to 17-year-old social-media users in the U.S. on Facebook slipped to 88 percent this year from 94 percent in 2013 and 95 percent in 2012. Facebook first warned a year ago that teens weren’t using its website as often as before, then stopped discussing teen usage on its earnings calls after last year’s disclosure alarmed investors. While more people use Facebook and its messaging app than any competitor, its user base tends to be older, with 55 percent of Facebook Messenger users being 37 or younger. By the same measure, 86 percent of Snapchat Inc.’s users and 83 percent of Kik Interactive Inc.’s users are under 37. Facebook sought to buy Snapchat last year for more than $3 billion, and was rebuffed. This has not prevented Facebook stock from reaching record highs: This year Facebook made further headway in mobile, a business that has flourished from a minor portion of ad revenue at the time of the IPO to a majority. Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion has also been paying off: A Citigroup Inc. analyst last week said the photo-sharing app is worth $35 billion.\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft maybe building a new, lean browser: ZDNet’s Mary Jo Foley’s recent report that the software company is building a lightweight browser, codenamed “Spartan,” bears out. According to Foley, Spartan is “new” and “isn’t [Internet Explorer].” Her post notes that it could be set free inside of the Windows 10 release schedule. In short, Microsoft may be building a speedy, simpler browser that maintains use of Internet Explorer’s rendering engine.\\n\\n\\nIndian startup action: Six startups graduating from TiE Bootcamp’s fourth batch: Frapp: It is a hyper local deal & offers service exclusively for college students.

Airtel last week announced a new plan to charge customers for data usage on instant messaging and VoIP apps like Skype, Viber, Whatsapp, and Line. But now the telecom operator has decided to wait for a regulatory framework to be put in place, according to a statement today from Airtel. Indian telecom regulator TRAI chairman Rahul Khullar had earlier stated that that while Airtel’s move was going against the concept of net neutrality, it was not illegal as there is no policy or regulatory framework in India which mandates operators to adhere to net neutrality. Net neutrality is the notion that service providers must not differentiate between the traffic that flows over their network so that every user and service has equal access to the network. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSnapdeal ties up with Hungama for a co-marketing deal, similar to its Saavn tie-up from last month: Snapdeal, and Mumbai’s Hungama Digital Media Entertainment have joined hands to roll out bundled offerings such as premium music videos with every purchase on the e-tailer’s mobile app. To begin with, Hungama.com is currently offering shoppers on Snapdeal a free access to its premium PRO service which consists of HD quality music videos with lyrics of songs for nine weeks. Hungama PRO, is an ad-free paid subscription service whose content can be accessed offline as well. After this offer, customers will be charged Rs 120 per month for the service. Early this month Hungama had also come out with a similar offer for subscribers to Aircel. The PRO services was launched six months ago with a free one month trial. Last month Saavn had sealed a similar co-marketing deal with free two months subscription to its premium service to Snapdeal shoppers on Android\\n\\n\\nQualcomm earns billions each year from its patent licensing, drawing Chinese telecom regulatory scrutiny: The settlement of China\\'s anti-trust probe into Qualcomm Inc is likely to intensify global scrutiny of the firm\\'s highly profitable patent licensing business, and may even call into question its worldwide contracts with smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung. Qualcomm is the top patent holder for cellphone technology, including many that form industry standards like CDMA and LTE. Charging royalties based on the cellphones\\' selling prices, even those made with competitors\\' chips, provided more than half of its $8 billion net income in 2014. As growth tapers in developed markets, the smartphone industry has turned to China, where the rollout of LTE technology is driving demand, and where the majority of the world\\'s smartphones are also manufactured. The NDRC, one of China\\'s anti-trust regulators, has said it suspects Qualcomm of overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards. Qualcomm is expected by industry sources to agree to changes in how it charges royalties on cellphones sold in China, which will hurt its bottom line in its fastest-growing and most significant market. Qualcomm earned about half of its global revenue of $26.5 billion in China for the fiscal year ended Sept. 28. An agreement to lower royalty rates charged by Qualcomm on phones sold in China could affect its contractual relationships not just with local manufacturers such as Huawei, Lenovo, ZTE and Xiaomi Inc, but also with bigger global players that make and sell phones in China, such as Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics, said patent lawyers consulted by Reuters.\\n\\n\\nPinterest expands Promoted Pins to all advertisers after a successful beta: The firm announced today that its Promoted Pins program, which it made available in beta to certain brands eight months ago, has performed “just as good and sometimes better than organic Pins,” and it will make the program available to all advertisers on January 1. Pinterest claims that brands who participated in the Promoted Pins beta program saw a 30 percent increase in “earned media” — or the amount of people who save a Promoted Pin to one of the boards. Promoted Pins are repinned an average of 11 times, the same as a normal pin made by one of the site’s users. Furthermore, Promoted Pins continued to get more pins in the month after a campaign, or a 5 percent increase in earned media. Once the Promoted Pins program rolls out, Pinterest says advertisers will have access to more ad formats and advanced targeting. In addition, it’s also launched the Pinstitute, a twee name for a program that will show advertisers how to leverage Promoted Pins through workshops and webinars. The Pinstitute follows the launch of Pinterest’s analytic dashboard in August, which lets advertisers track how their pins performed and how much content is being pinned from their sites through Pinterest’s Pin It buttons. Pinterest has been focused on monetizing its site since raising an impressive $225 million Series E in October 2013, which valued the company at $3.8 billion. At that time, Pinterest said one of the key uses of the capital would be to continue development of monetization, which it first began testing around the same time it closed its Series E, into a global program.\\n\\n\\nOracle\\'s purchase of Datalogix highlights the rising importance of attribution: This week, Oracle showed just how important attribution services have become: It agreed to buy Datalogix, one of the leading players in the attribution, for what the analyst Brian Wieser estimated was in the high hundreds of millions of dollars. (Neither Oracle nor Datalogix would disclose the deal terms.) With their services in high demand, the attribution companies are a rare bright spot in an otherwise brutally competitive market among companies that provide the technical services for digital advertising. Even though you’ve probably never heard of Datalogix, it’s almost certainly heard of you. It buys purchase data from supermarket loyalty cards and other retail channels and also tracks what people do online. That data is vital to digital platforms, particularly Facebook and Twitter, which are trying to prove to marketers that ads on their services lead to sales in the store. Using a complex system that anonymously matches Datalogix’s profiles with Facebook or Twitter IDs and aggregates that data, the social networks can show that, say, a three-month ad campaign on Facebook for MegaRed krill oil actually prompted more people to buy the health supplement. How Datalogix does the matching is a bit of a black box, but brands and publishers believe that it works, with Datalogix boasting about 650 customers. The company’s biggest competitor, a partnership between Nielsen and Catalina Marketing, is more oriented towards measuring the impact of television ads on purchases, while Datalogix is more focused on digital platforms, according to Mr. Wieser.\\n\\n\\nAmazon.com Inc said on Friday it drew more than 10 million new members to Prime shipping and digital content service over the holidays and intends to offer one-hour shipping to more cities in 2015. Amazon considers its $99-a-year Prime membership, which confers free two-day shipping and streaming of select movies and songs, essential to driving its growth and margins. It was unclear, however, how many of the 10 million new members were just taking advantage of a standing 30-day free trial offer. The Internet retailer has never disclosed the precise number of Prime subscribers, except to say it is in the tens of millions. Analysts estimate it is growing at a rapid clip, and the company continues to try and spice it up with new content. The company\\'s shares climbed 2.07 percent to $309.31 in midday Nasdaq trading. Amazon said customers ordered more than 10 times as many items via same-day delivery this holiday season, compared with a year earlier.\\n\\n\\nTop 10 Pricing Mistakes, e-Commerce companies make, according to TechCrunch: 1: Basing prices on costs, not customers’ perceptions of value. 2: Companies base their prices on “the marketplace.” 3: Same profit margin across different product lines. 4: Companies fail to segment their customers. 5: Companies hold prices at the same level for too long. 6: Salespeople incentivized strictly on revenue. 7: Changing prices without forecasting competitors’ reactions. 8: Companies spend insufficient resources managing their pricing practices. 9: Companies fail to establish internal procedures to optimize prices. 10: Companies rely on salespeople and other customer-facing staff for pricing intelligence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIts a slow day, with not a lot going on, so here are 2 shallow-dives, one into Alibaba\\'s M&A in 2014, and the other on Indonesia\\'s eCommerce market, both courtesy of TechInAsia.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIndonesian ecommerce:\\xa0\\n\\nOnline share of retail:\\xa0This year, of the nation’s US$411.29 billion in retail spending, Indonesia saw an uptick to US$2.6 billion spent in ecommerce.\\xa0\\neCommerce Leaders:\\xa0Lazada Indonesia, Rocket Internet’s answer to Amazon, made the jump to the top spot in 2014. SingPost reasons that Lazada took the lead because it made a shift away from consumer electronics and focused more on lifestyle goods. Lazada’s marketing campaigns in Bahasa Indonesia were also key wins for Rocket.\\xa0\\nMarket Potential:\\xa0Last year, Indonesia clocked in at 74.8 million internet users. Last year, Indonesia had 4.6 million online shoppers. This year, it has 5.9 million. 20 percent of Indonesian online shoppers prefer conventional shopping sites like Lazada or Zalora, while 26.4 percent prefer social media like Facebook or Instagram. 26.6 percent prefer online forums or classified sites like Kaskus or OLX.\\xa0\\nUser Habits - social media:\\xa0SingPost says that between January and March 2014, Twitter users in Jakarta posted 2.4 percent of the global total of 10.6 billion tweets during that time period, maintaining the city’s reign as the Twitter capital of the world. However, the nation’s most popular social media channel continues to be Facebook, with 69 million active users. As of September, Indonesia has 30 million Line users. Remarkably, nearly 27 percent of all the country’s ecommerce transactions occurred via social media in 2014.\\xa0\\nUser Habits - messaging:\\xa0Surprisingly, the highest percentage of online shoppers in Indonesia would rather buy from messaging apps like Blackberry Messenger or Line.\\xa0\\nCategory Preferences:\\xa0While Indonesians shop across multiple categories, the most popular one is by far clothing and apparel, with 61.7 percent of the nation’s online shoppers making a purchase in that category last year. Females reign supreme in the archipelago’s ecommerce space, with women having higher purchase rates, and the highest spending amount on clothing, mobile devices, travel items, laptops, and accessories.\\xa0\\nMeans of Payment:\\xa0Bank transfers are the most popular way to pay for online transactions, followed by cash on delivery, and finally credit cards. Less than five percent of Indonesia’s population own credit cards, and credit card payments still account for less than 10 percent of all online transactions in the archipelago.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba’s 2014 investments and acquisitions: List below - 33 transactions, known investments of about $5.3B (could be a lot higher, since about half these transactions are of unknown sizes)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

The store currently offers over hundred products across categories like seeds, irrigation and farming tools. The firm has started with some 300 SKUs to begin with and also plans to launch a hindi version of the store. On the face of it, the approach seems to be unique, however what could be interesting to see is how does Snapdeal makes it simpler to buy such products online or for that matter the smartphone. Moreover, how does it tackle the pain point of logistics without bloating up the cost of purchase and cash payments in remote villages. We tried checking for some random fertiliser for a remote village in eastern region in India and the site threw up a “Product cannot be delivered at your pincode location” message. But to be fair its the first day of its official launch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGift cards are the best gifts, research shows: the less specific the gift, the more it will be appreciated. The sad truth is that while gift cards constitute a minority of holiday gifts, according to the National Retail Federation, they have been the most popular gift request since 2007. In studies to be presented early next year at a conference of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, researchers tried to analyze the emotional turmoil churned up by the exchanging of gifts, noting that the giver’s earnest intentions may often widely miss the mark of the recipient’s true desires. The closer the relationship, the more thought givers believe they should put into selecting a gift. But when subjects were asked what they would like to receive, they overwhelmingly replied that they wanted credit-card gift cards, which would give them the flexibility to choose exactly what they want. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHuawei\\'s smartphone sales shoot up after copying Xiaomi\\'s online strategy: China\\'s Huawei has taken sales of its low-price Honor brand of smartphones to 20 million from 1 million in just one year, hitting pay dirt with the disruptive online-only strategy it copied from smaller upstart Xiaomi.\\xa0Privately owned Xiaomi, valued at over $45 billion, sold 15.8 million smartphones in July-September versus Huawei\\'s 15.9 million, according to Gartner. A year earlier, Xiaomi reached just 3.6 million compared with 11.7 million for Huawei. But analysts say the low-cost strategy has fanned the price wars and thin profit margins prevalent in China, and that its spread could affect margins at all makers. Honor brand president Jeff Liu said industry transition to an online sales strategy was inevitable given the competitive pricing, afforded by reduced distribution expenses that would otherwise make up 30 percent of handset costs. \"E-commerce is massively changing the traditional channels for the smartphone industry, and we needed to go in that direction too,\" Liu said in an interview in Beijing, where he unveiled the Honor 6 Plus smartphone last week. Honor handsets dropped the Huawei name last December and have since been marketed and distributed independently of Huawei-branded phones. They are sold in countries ranging from Belgium to Brazil, primarily via marketplaces such as those of JD.com Inc in China and Flipkart in India. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndian startup action: Six startups selected for Kyron’s new accelerator batch: Cubito: It has developed an employee transport system that features automated grouping, routing & driver allocation, besides information exchanges between employee & drivers. All allocations are done in real time.  Xpense Manager: It is an app that aims to simplify process of expense claims & reimbursements inside companies by way of supporting the business workflow of approvals & support for policies for employee expense & reimbursements. Eywa Media Innovations: It aims to make TV watching interactive and fun. The company claims to have partnered with a leading broadcaster in India already. Viamagus : A SaaS startup, Viamagus claims it helps simplify the way businesses and individuals build & maintain their online presence and do business online. Its cloud- based tools help you build websites & portfolios, blogs, e-mail/SMS campaigns and landing pages quickly, and in a code-free and fully hosted manner. The firm has over 100 customers. Cashkumar: It is an online platform that claims to be providing the best rates for foreign currency exchange in Bangalore, Mumbai and Pune. With an aggregation platform backed by a reverse bidding process, travellers can buy or sell their foreign currency and travel insurance at the best possible rates. Adwyze: It is a marketing optimisation platform that allows marketers to improve the performance of their marketing budgets. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntel\\'s margins are being buoyed by rising prices for custom chips for cloud computing:\\xa0Companies like A.W.S. “are running a million servers, so floor space, power, cooling, people — you want to optimize everything,” Ms. Bryant said. “The name of the game is customization.” Indeed. Amazon has gone so far as to change around the 50 megawatt power substations that power its bunkers of computers. Deep in Google, former company executives say, the company has changed the way Internet packets of data work, to optimize how quickly they flow through Google. Facebook, which has by far the world’s largest public repository of pictures, might want a certain number of chips that can render images well, or rapidly process the steps for image recognition. That could affect the number of processing cores it wants on a chip. When eBay installed a hyper-efficient cooling system, it asked Intel for chips that had a greater thermal tolerance (they can be worked harder that way.) The difference appears to be showing up in Intel’s results. While most of Intel’s chips still go into PCs, about one-quarter of Intel’s revenue, and a much bigger share of its profits, come from semiconductors for data centers. In the first nine months of 2014, the average selling price of PC chips fell 4 percent. But the average price on data center chips was up 10 percent, compared with the same period in 2013.\\n\\n\\nAfter its Bluekai acquisition in February, Oracle is close by buying Datalogix, another audience-data major; Purchase likely exceeds $500 million Datalogix, whose clients include PepsiCo and HauteLook, helps brands measure media purchases against in-store sales. Datalogix has been an important partner to Facebook as the latter has attempted to show marketers that it can connect the dots between its social ads and offline purchases. Adexchanger reported that Facebook was one of Datalogix\\'s suitors, along with Nielsen and Adobe. But Oracle ultimately nabbed Datalogix, which makes its new Redwood City, Calif.-based parent a more formidable marketing cloud player for clients like General Motors. The company will be able to boast a wealth of online and offline data to compete against rivals Adobe and Salesforce. The Datalogix price tag probably well exceeded $500 million. \"Oracle is purchasing Datalogix for an amount we expect will be in the high hundreds of millions of dollars,\" said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, in an email. Wieser added that Datalogix \"analyzes, segments and distributes data for use by marketers, and then analyzes data again post-campaign. While these functions are not unique to Datalogix, there is likely some experiential advantage that Datalogix has established in the processes it uses, and the Facebook relationship is a key one which is also relatively (although not entirely) unique.\"\\n\\n\\nA summary of expedited delivery services from Amazon, Uber, eBay and Google: Amazon’s Prime Now (announced just last week) One-hour delivery for thousands of daily staples — paper towels, shampoo, books, batteries and more — is now available to Amazon Primers in certain parts of Manhattan. The catch? The delivery fee is $7.99. But if you can wait an extra hour, two-hour delivery is free. Amazon says that Prime Now will be available in additional cities in 2015. UberESSENTIALS  the app-based ride provider is now dabbling in e-commerce, too. DC residents can now order “essential” items via the Uber app and receive them in 10 minutes or less. No delivery fee, tip or minimum order required. The expense charges are most likely factored into the items’ cost, but Uber provides transparency with an inventory list and associated prices. These items range from wine glasses to a portable table-tennis set to candy to grooming products. Uber even has a New Year’s Eve section for those last-minute party essentials. According to the company, uberESSENTIALS is a limited time–only experiment, but if the service takes off, the program may expand. EBay Local: eBay shoppers in select cities can choose to have their purchases delivered through traditional means, same-day delivery or self-pickup at a nearby location. EBay has a similar program already in place in the UK and is now slowly rolling out its Local pilot program across the US. It’s currently available in New York, San Francisco, San Jose, Dallas and Chicago. Google Express: Google also offers same-day delivery and overnight delivery in San Francisco, San Jose, West Los Angeles, Manhattan, Chicago, Boston, and Washington, DC. Consumers can purchase goods online from a number of well-known national retailers — Whole Foods, Staples, Costco and Walgreens — and have the order on their doorstep within the day. Although a Google Express membership is required, new customers can try it for free for three months.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn China, digital ad spend will overtake TV next year, amid a rapid jump to mobile advertising: Next year companies are expected to spend more money on digital advertising than on television campaigns in China. It is a stark shift from three years ago when nearly half of the advertising dollars went to television and just 14 percent went to digital, according to ZenithOptimedia, an advertising agency. China is also diverging from the United States, where television continues to dominate. Homegrown social media platforms in China are at the center of the push. Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are all blocked in China, giving platforms like Tencent’s Weixin — known as WeChat outside the country — and Sina Weibo an advantage. “I’ve been here four years. In that time I’m now on the third dominant social network — first it was Renren, then Weibo and now it’s WeChat,” said Chris Jones, the executive creative director at the ad agency Wunderman in China. Weixin’s particular quirk — that users communicate only with friends and contacts within their circle — has allowed companies to develop direct relationships with consumers. But it also poses a challenge since users have to first choose to include a brand within their Weixin network.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYouTube struggles to monetize\\xa0despite its enormous engagement..:\\xa0\\xa0For all of its influence as a cultural force, YouTube is still finding its way as an economic one. Viewers may be migrating online in droves from traditional television, but the advertising dollars have not yet followed. The marketing research company eMarketer estimates that YouTube will log about $1.13 billion in ad revenue in 2014, a small fraction of the $200 billion global TV advertising market. The quality of most YouTube programming is too unpolished to draw big investments from many blue-chip advertisers. YouTube creators, meanwhile, complain that the company takes too much of the ad revenue — as much as 49 percent — and does too little to market and promote its stars, which makes it hard for them to leverage their celebrity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYouTube also faces a host of small rivals -\\xa0startups like Interlude that are gaining traction:\\xa0The basic format of Interlude’s videos will be familiar to anyone who grew up on the “Choose Your Own Adventure” book series. As the film plays, a viewer is prompted with questions about how to proceed — wear the black dress or the white one? — and the video seamlessly integrates each choice. The company is one of many challenging YouTube’s dominance of online video. Vessel, started by two former Hulu executives, recently revealed a plan to offer $3 subscriptions for early access to short videos. And in September, the Universal Music Group made a deal with Mirriad, a company that specializes in inserting new ads into old videos. Interlude’s success against a giant like YouTube — which is owned by Google and attracts more than a billion viewers each month — is by no means guaranteed. But it has already had some promising hits. more engaged audience yields higher ad rates, and Interlude’s narrative mazes also offer ways for producers to incorporate brands (for a fee, of course). In one illustration cited by Robert S. Wiesenthal, Warner Music’s chief operating officer, the viewer of a rap video could choose to have the star keep dancing at a party or hop into a BMW. “We are all on this hunt for monetization,” Mr. Wiesenthal said. “When someone makes a choice to learn about something, that is worth more than, say, a passive pre-roll ad or a guy just holding a bottle of Scotch in his hands.”\\n\\n\\nBeacon-enabled mannequins are the latest in mobile app notifications:\\xa0“We decided we had to work out a way to bring the good old-fashioned mannequin into the 21st century,” said Jonathan Berlin, the managing director of Universal Display, the company that is selling mannequins with electronic implants. About a year ago, Mr. Berlin and his partner, Adrian Coe, had an idea to outfit their product with electronic beacons, small transmitters that can communicate with your cellphone. Mr. Berlin and Mr. Coe created a separate company, Iconeme, just for the beacons, which interact with users through the company’s app. Shoppers can see what a store’s mannequins are wearing, who designed the clothes and how much they cost. But these can beckon you from outside the store, sending messages to your cellphones and beaming pictures of their outfits onto them. They are one of the latest efforts by the struggling retail industry to lure customers away from the Internet and back into brick-and-mortar stores. Don’t feel like going through the store to find an item? You can even buy it through the app. Iconeme is not the only business trying to use technology to help people shop in stores. A company called MyBestFit created kiosks that quickly scan people’s bodies, analyze a database of clothes and make suggestions. Iconeme’s first beacon mannequin began in Britain in August. Since then, about 3,500 people have downloaded the company’s app, Mr. Berlin said. Beacon technology is already popular with retailers along Regent Street, a high-end strip of stores in London, which already use beacons to ping shoppers with promotions and advertisements. He said three retailers in the United States were testing his products, but declined to disclose them, citing confidentiality restrictions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXiaomi\\xa0close to raising $1B, valuation seen at ~$45B: Xiaomi raises over $1B from All-Stars Investment, DST Global, others. The round, which is expected to be closed this week, would value Xiaomi at more than $45 billion, as per this report. Chinese smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi, which also has a good presence in India, has netted over $1 billion in funding led by All-Stars Investment, an investment firm launched by former Morgan Stanley analyst Richard Ji, says a The Wall Street Journal report quoting an unnamed source. Russian investment firm DST Global, besides Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC also participated in the round.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFlipkart raises $700M, valuation seen at ~$11B: Flipkart, India’s largest e-commerce marketplace, has raised $700 million in fresh investment from existing as well as new investors Baillie Gifford, Greenoaks Capital, Steadview Capital, T Rowe Price Associates and Qatar Investment Authority. The e-commerce powerhouse, which is on a fund-raising spree, has raised funding for the third time in 2014. In May, it had raised $210 million (about Rs 1,200 crore). It had raised funding worth $1 billion (about Rs 6,000) in July. The latest round of fund-raising has seen investment from existing stakeholders DST Global, GIC, ICONIQ Capital and Tiger Global. According to reports, the latest fund-raising has pegged Flipkart’s valuation at $11 billion. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSnapdeal.com partners with Hero MotoCorp to sell two-wheelers through its platform: Snapdeal claims that it saw 700 two-wheelers being sold within 72 hours of launching the new category a week ago. The vehicles are priced as same as offline dealerships. For Snapdeal, automobile is one of the most promising categories, and it expects it to reach Rs 1,000 crores in GMV in the near term.\\n\\n\\nGoogle\\'s launches \"Store Visits\", making it easier to figure out if online ads drove in-store traffic: The tech giant is rolling out a new tool today called \"store visits\" that gives marketers some insight into which types of search ads—which include local inventory and product listings ads—motivate people to go to a store. Google\\'s store visits tool uses an algorithm to estimate how many people went into a store as a result of seeing an ad within 30 days. In turn, advertisers are given anonymous data (meaning that it doesn\\'t pinpoint specific users) that is collected from smartphone owners who have turned on their location history. To qualify for the new tool, Google advertisers need to verify their location with the search giant and set up location extensions in an AdWords account. Store visit info is only available to U.S. advertisers and will gradually be rolled out within the next few months.\\n\\n\\nCredit derivatives traders helping RadioShack stay alive: RadioShack is finding an unlikely ally in its efforts to stay out of bankruptcy: credit derivatives traders who amassed more than $25 billion of trades speculating how much longer it can keep paying its bills. When the retailer’s biggest shareholder arranged $585 million of funding in October to help it survive the holidays, much of the money came from hedge funds wagering on the company to avoid default, said people with knowledge of the trading. By injecting the 93-year-old electronics retailer with new money, swaps traders, more often blamed for pushing companies toward bankruptcy, have been preserving big payoffs if they can delay or prevent a default. “The sellers of the protection built up quite a large war chest, and it took a relatively small amount of money to keep the company going,” said Peter Tchir, a former credit-swaps trader who is now head of macro strategy at Brean Capital LLC in New York. “They have huge incentives to keep the company alive to not trigger the swaps.”\\n\\n\\nIBM says its cloud business is having a \\'breakthrough year\\': IBM aims to expand the number of data centers it offers clients around the world by 25 percent to meet fast-rising demand for internet-based services, after what a company executive said has been a \"breakthrough year\" in 2014 for its cloud computing business. IBM has quadrupled the number of cloud data facilities it offers around the world to 49 in the past 18 months, responding in part to laws requiring the local retention of data following revelations over U.S. government Web surveillance as well as increased corporate compliance rules. IBM\\'s cloud revenue amounted to $4.4 billion in 2013 and was up by 50 percent in the first nine months of this year, it reported in October, making it one of IBM\\'s fastest-growing businesses IBM has announced multi-year deals in recent weeks worth a total of more than $4 billion that are fuelling the company\\'s expansion in data centers. The company\\'s cloud computing services let companies mix classic computing jobs with new ways of working, a twist on the largely consumer-facing cloud services made popular by Amazon\\'s Web Services, Google and Microsoft. IBM, along with rivals Hewlett-Packard and EMC\\'s VMware, offer “hybrid cloud” services that let customers run key business data on private, internal networks along with consumer-facing public cloud systems.\\n\\n\\nZomato expands in Italy by acquiring Cibando: After recently adding a presence in Central and Eastern Europe by means of two local acquisitions, the New Delhi-headquartered company, which now boasts a presence in 20 countries, has gobbled up Italy’s Cibando. Terms of the acquisition remain undisclosed, though Zomato says all of Cibando’s team will be joining the company and will now lead its efforts to build out the service in Italy. This will include integrating Cibando into Zomato, thus transitioning its user base and traffic. It also plans to scale up its teams in Rome and Milan to 30-40 full-time employees over the next three months, up from Cibando’s current headcount of 10. Even longer term, Zomato says it will invest $6 million in its newly-acquired Italian operations over the next 2 years, growing the team to 150-200 people across the country’s top six cities. That planned increase in headcount is probably a reflection of Zomato’s relatively labor-intensive business model, at least compared to other pure Internet plays. To power part of its restaurant search and discovery engine, the company collects menus from restaurants and scans them using OCR. Its menu data is then re-checked in person by Zomato’s team every three months to ensure it stays relatively fresh, and it’s this “feet on the street” approach that attempts to differentiate the company from competitors, such as Yelp, IAC-owned Urbanspoon, Priceline-acquired OpenTable, and TripAdvisor. Discussing today’s acquisition, Zomato co-founder Pankaj Chaddah tells me that Cibando is one of the largest restaurant search services in Italy and lists 82,000 restaurants across various cities. In November, the company closed a further $60 million in funding, giving it a post-money valuation of $660 million, and taking total funding to over $113 million.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSony cancels movie release after terror threats:\\xa0Sony Pictures Entertainment on Wednesday dropped plans for its Christmas Day release of “The Interview,” a movie that depicts the assassination of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, after receiving a terror threat against theaters. Before that, the four largest theater chains in the United States said they would not show the movie, which has been at the center of a devastating hacking attack on Sony over the last several weeks. American intelligence officials on Wednesday concluded that the North Korean government was centrally involved with the attacks on Sony’s computers. That determination and the cancellation of the film were new twists in a series of developments that has found a major studio fighting for its art, and perhaps life, against forces driven by a foreign government. Hackers claim to have taken at least 100 terabytes of Sony data, or about 10 times of the amount stored in the Library of Congress. Sony computer systems were damaged and the studio is already the focus of at least two lawsuits from former employees who had their personal information spread online. \\n\\n\\nHow smartphones maybe reducing Amazon\\'s edge: Phones have already radically altered both the way Americans shop and how retail goods move about the economy, but the transformation is just beginning — and it is far from guaranteed that Amazon will emerge victorious from the transition. Phones are at the heart of the service offered by Postmates, one of several start-ups that are working with retailers and helping to change shopping experiences. As local retailers adopt mobile innovations, customers will be able to search stores’ inventories, purchase goods for same-day delivery, and navigate and search for help and reviews inside a crowded store. None of these technologies pose an existential threat to Amazon, but by giving physical stores some of the conveniences that Amazon has long had, they may limit its potential reach. With Instacart, you can get groceries delivered instantly from big and small supermarkets. With Google’s Express delivery service, you can get household goods from big-box stores delivered on the same day you order. The app Curbside lets users order items from Target, and have them ready when they drive up to a store. And with Postmates, it is possible to order takeout, and pretty much anything else, and have it delivered directly very quickly. These services all have in common speed and convenience: Because they route purchases from stores, they can often shuttle goods to buyers faster than they are available from Amazon. The prices are even competitive with Amazon, which delivers most of its products, even groceries, from warehouses that are a few hours away.\\n\\n\\nTwitter\\'s CEO has sold >500K shares since November: Twitter CEO Dick Costolo’s family trusts sold $5.32 million worth of Twitter shares Monday, and the sale comes at an interesting time. Twitter shares have declined nearly 45% this year, and Ev Williams, Twitter’s cofounder, just sold more than 719,000 shares, worth nearly $28.7 million, last month. Jack Dorsey, too, is reported to have sold $2.1 million worth of his shares last month. Also, back in April, Twitter executives, including Costolo, Williams and Dorsey had indicated in an SEC filing that they had no “current plans” of selling their shares, even after the company’s lock up period ends.\\n\\n\\nIndian startup action: Zepo.in, Livspace get funding:  Zepo.in, a do-it-yourself (DIY) e-commerce platform for SMBs, has secured an undisclosed amount in funding led by Anupam Mittal, CEO of People Group, which operates the internet properties including Shaadi.com and makaan.com. Zepo can help an SMB to open its online shop in a few minutes for under Rs 999 per month. It also provides them free payment gateway, logistics support and marketing. With 20 employees on board, Zepo has offices in Delhi and Bangalore. The firm mainly competes with Nirvana Venture Advisors-backed KartRocket.com, besides MartMobi, Shopify and CostPrize. Livspace, an online marketplace for personalised home interior design and décor, has received $4.6 million in its Series A round of funding. Livspace claims that it enables homeowners to discover thousands of pre-created looks for all rooms, kitchen, and storage areas in their homes at the click of a button. Customers can select and purchase these looks, which are created by international designers, and personalise them (by material, colour, style) online. The startup will then deliver the items at the customers’ doorsteps. Livspace has partnered with many real-estate developers in the country and also offers a ‘find your apartment’ feature to offer pre-created, ready-to-install interior design for customers who buy homes from these developers.\\n\\n\\nChinese phone maker OnePlus, selling on Amazon in India, has been barred by the Delhi HC from selling, marketing, or importing phones in India. The dispute centers around OnePlus using Cyanogenmod’s version of Android, which is licensed exclusively in India by rival phone brand Micromax. OnePlus received a shock in October when Micromax acquired the rights to be Cyanogen’s exclusive partner in India in order to launch Micromax’s new YU Cyanogen phone on December 18. Cyanogen has already clarified that OnePlus One phones sold in India will not receive updates. In return, OnePlus says it will start work on a custom Android build for its users in India. The high court has allowed the Chinese company, which launched its OnePlus One phones in India through Amazon on December 2, to clear its stock of Cyanogen-based products.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Pay continues to gain traction: On Tuesday, Apple announced that in recent weeks the company had signed up dozens more banks, retail stores and start-ups to adopt Apple Pay, the company’s new e-commerce product, which allows customers to buy things with little more than a wave of their iPhone. The new companies that recently agreed to work with the service include SunTrust, Barclaycard and USAA. Ten more banks, including TD Bank North America and Commerce Bank, will back the new form of payment on Tuesday. With the new additions, Apple says it supports the cards that represent about 90 percent of the credit card purchase volume in the United States.  While Apple Pay still accounts for a tiny fraction of total transactions, the new additions suggest that Apple has generated more traction for the service than any competing service. Others giant companies like Google, Verizon and AT&T have offered similar takes on a smartphone-based e-commerce product, though to little avail.\\n\\n\\nFacebook Starts Auto-Enhancing Photos on the same day that Instagram launches its first new filters since 2012: Rather than making you manually filter them, Facebook tells me it will now auto-enhance newly uploaded photos starting today on iOS and soon on Android. You’ll be able to adjust a slider to control just how enhanced you want the light, shadow, and clarity, or revert back to your original shot. Facebook and the other social apps are locked in a battle for photo sharing. To the winner goes tons of engagement. That’s why Twitter just revamped its filtering interface, Snapchat started letting you dual-filter with color filters and its geo-filter titles, and Instagram today added five new filters. Google+ added a similar auto-enhance feature a year ago. Photos are automatically enhanced, but you can quickly tone the effect up or down. I found the auto-enhancements to be a touch overzealous in some of my experiments, but it’s typically in the ballpark of how I’d want to edit a photo, plus it requires no work on my part.\\n\\n\\nAmazon India launches jewelry sales; separately an auto-repricing bug drops some prices on Amazon UK to a penny, shocking some sellers: A groups of British Amazon.co.uk sellers were shocked last week to find their goods had gotten an unexpected and drastic price cut -- to just a penny. Although Amazon and other retailers do occasionally run promotions where things only cost one cent, this glitch was the fault of non-Amazon software from RepricerExpress, which automatically reprices items online. The problem only lasted for about an hour, but it came during peak shopping time ahead of Christmas, at a time when many customers are looking to online shopping to get last-minute gifts to their destinations on time. And, according to Britain\\'s Sky News, some retailers say the glitch cost them tens of thousands of dollars, and may even put some of them out of business. Repricing software is commonly used by retailers and individuals who regularly sell items on Amazon and other online marketplaces. These automated tools are used by sellers across the globe to send prices down (or up) depending on market demand. The company, which claims to support over 2,000 sellers on Amazon and Raukten.com, has apologized for the error and said it\\'s looking to \"put measures in place\" to keep the mistake from happening again. As of Monday, the company said, systems were running normally. Most affected orders were canceled. In a statement, Amazon said it\\'s working to remedy the few orders that were processed and will be reaching out to sellers on its own.\\n\\n\\nXiaomi India ban on Redmi Note 4G, the Mi3, and the Redmi 1S lifted; Redmi Note remains fully banned: Delhi HC partially lifts the ban on Chinese handset maker Xiaomi for importing & selling smartphones in India. Today’s ruling allows Xiaomi to sell only Qualcomm-powered smartphones in India, and only until January 8, 2015. This allows Xiaomi to sell three of the four models it had launched in India – the Redmi Note 4G, the Mi3, and the Redmi 1S. The MediaTek-powered Redmi Note remains fully banned. The Delhi High Court has now permitted the company to sell and import Qualcomm chipset-based (a licensee of Ericsson) handsets in the country till Jan 8, 2015, according to a tweet by PTI. A Mint report further mentions that Xiaomi has also been told to deposit Rs 100 for every device it has sold in India or sells till January 5. Last month, Jun Lei, co-founder and CEO, Xiaomi, had said that India is becoming its largest overseas market for Xiaomi. According to the company, it has already sold over 500,000 smartphones in the country in less than four months of operations. It is now also considering setting up a manufacturing base in the country.\\n\\n\\nGoogle is in danger of losing mobile advertising to Facebook, reports Amir Efrati at The Information. Google still does more than twice as much revenue as Facebook on mobile advertising overall, thanks to search. But when it comes to graphical and video ads on mobile devices, their positions are reversed: Facebook does three times as much revenue as Google there.  Worse, Google’s share of these kinds of ads is falling. Google’s biggest problem is its inability to track ads across devices, meaning it has a harder time proving that a sale is made after a user sees one of its mobile ads. Facebook’s ad platform is more integrated. The company is able to tell if someone sees an app on Facebook’s mobile ad and then buys that product on their laptop.  It uses cookies — identifiers that match a user’s web browser to their smartphone — to collect data on users. Google collects cookies too, but it doesn’t share them across its ad products. Google’s search engine data is never mixed with Google DoubleClick data, which tracks Google’s ads on non-Google sites. Google also doesn’t have a way of knowing whether or not a user has already bought the product they’re seeing an ad for.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBig data companies are acting far more as services companies than they hope to be eventually: Data science, as a business, is still young. As the technology moves beyond the Internet incubators like Google and Facebook, it has to be applied company by company, in one industry after another. At this stage, there is a lot of hand craftsmanship rather than software automation. So the aspiring software companies find themselves training, advising and building pilot projects for their commercial customers. They are acting far more as services companies than they hope to be eventually. For now, the technical hand-holding and pump-priming is an essential step. The young companies are building the market of commercial users in retailing, finance, consumer products, health care and other industries to which they will then sell software. The cost of chasing the big data opportunity can be daunting. A glimpse into one company’s bet was revealed last month, when Hortonworks filed documents to prepare for selling shares to the public. Hortonworks is a leading distributor of the open-source Hadoop software, which is a database for handling so-called unstructured data from the web, sensors and smartphones, used in big data analytics. The company’s financial statements show rapid growth in revenue, more than doubling in the nine months that ended on Sept. 30, to $33.4 million. But its costs surged, resulting in a net loss of $86.7 million, well more than double its total revenue.\\n\\n\\nSurveyMonkey raises $250M, valued at ~ $2B: SurveyMonkey, the Silicon Valley company that runs an online survey and questionnaire platform, announced today that it has raised $250 million in a new round of funding. The raise was first reported last night by the Wall Street Journal, and was officially confirmed by the company this morning. The new money will be used at least in part to fuel more M&A transactions, and to allow some existing investors and employees to cash out if they choose, SurveyMonkey said in a statement. This brings the total amount of venture capital invested into the 15-year-old company to more than $1.15 billion. The new round, which included participation from a group of institutional investors, reportedly values SurveyMonkey at some $2 billion, up significantly from the $1.35 billion valuation the company had just one year ago.\\n\\n\\nFacebook video\\'s success is scaring Google, causing Twitter to weigh autoplay:\\xa0Since launching autoplay earlier this year, Facebook has been catching up to YouTube in views. In September, Facebook said it was showing 1 billion videos per day. The Twitter source, who has seen the latest numbers, said that figure has already grown to 3 billion. The insider added that the completion rate—where viewers watch the entirety of a video—is “mind-boggling,” suggesting that autoplay is a winning strategy and something Twitter ought to implement, even at the risk of upsetting some users. Meanwhile, “Google is freaking out,” said a media agency executive, as Facebook attempts to poach YouTube talent in order to improve the quality of its video offerings. YouTube has gone on the defensive with lucrative counteroffers in exchange for exclusivity. Twitter is divided over whether to allow videos to simply start playing when users scroll over them. It is a feature already adopted by Facebook, but one that scares Twitter purists who don’t want it to stray farther from its text-based roots, according to industry insiders with knowledge of the company’s video strategy. “It’s an argument that’s happening—a tug of war,” said one.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAmazon has dipped its toes into the greeting card business with its new mobile app, Surprise! (Yes, the exclamation mark is included.) The app allows users to personalize e-cards with photos, audio or video. The main draw? You can conveniently attach an Amazon gift card to your e-card via one simple app. The Facebook-powered app (yes, the social giant is behind this as well) is equipped with the ability to sync your Facebook account and phone calendar, making it virtually impossible to miss being present (get it?) for an important occasion. The app also helps you avoid the panicky brainstorm sessions you face when gift-stumped for your hard-to-buy-for loved ones. Surprise! is available for iOS and Android users.\\n\\n\\nUber surge prices during Sydney standoff, then backs off, also UberPop banned in France. On Monday, as the police surrounded a cafe in Sydney, Australia, where an armed individual was holding hostages, Uber began raising rates. The move, which the company calls surge pricing, is governed by an algorithm and occurs whenever demand spikes for rides in an area. The idea is that higher rates give drivers incentive to fill the demand. With the authorities cordoning off part of the city’s central business district, many who were stranded in the area were forced to pay roughly four times the normal rate, according to complaints on social media. In a relatively quick response, the company released a statement explaining what happened. “Surge pricing is algorithmic and responded automatically to the large increase in demand for Uber rides out of the C.B.D.,” it said, referring to the central business district. “As soon as we became aware of the situation, we capped it and made all rides free to people leaving Sydney’s C.B.D. Uber is paying for these rides. If riders got charged surge pricing earlier, we will refund it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

The move, confirmed by a company spokesperson, comes as Facebook has revamped its own search offerings, introducing a tool on Monday that allows users to quickly find past comments and other information posted by their friends on Facebook. The decision may reflect the increasing importance that Facebook sees in Web search technology, a market dominated by rival Google Inc (GOOGL.O). Facebook and Microsoft have a longstanding relationship dating back to Microsoft\\'s $240 million investment in Facebook, for a 1.6 percent stake in the company, in October 2007. As part of that deal, Microsoft provided banner ads on Facebook\\'s website in international markets. Facebook stopped using Microsoft banner ads in 2010 as it moved to take more control of its advertising business. But Facebook, during that same time, expanded its use of Microsoft Bing search results to international versions of its service.\\n\\n\\nBaidu said to buy stake in Uber, Boosting App in China: Baidu Inc. (BIDU) is buying a minority stake in Uber Technologies Inc., giving the car-booking company a boost as it expands in China, according to a person familiar with the matter. Uber will receive cash and non-cash assets, including Baidu’s online resources as owner of China’s biggest Internet search engine, the person said, asking not to be identified as the matter is private. The investment may be worth as much as $600 million, China National Radio reported earlier. Uber is expanding in China and hiring in 14 cities, according to a July 1 LinkedIn post. Uber has been targeting customers willing to pay a premium for the luxury of tracking the vehicle’s approach, not handling local cash and finding daily newspapers and a Wi-Fi access inside the car.\\n\\n\\nAlibaba\\'s efforts to position 12/12 as another Singles Day (focused on Taobao) seem to have met with only mixed success: Alibaba has tried hard to position Double 12 as a similar shopping bonanza to Singles Day. Last year, it promoted the day heavily on Taobao and flooded other online and offline channels with advertisements. Taobao bought most of the internet portal traffic, and “12/12” signage saturated billboards and bus stops. After stressing that the nature of December 12 is different from November 11, Alibaba has kept the traffic and revenue results from the past two Double 12s on the down-low. The lack of numbers released has led many to believe that Double 12’s results didn’t live up to Alibaba’s initial expectations. The reason for the underwhelming sales? Hard to say for sure, but there are many theories. First off, it’s been just a month since Singles Day. Retailers’ inventory and consumers’ budgets may not be sufficient enough to take part in the 12/12 extravaganza. Also, it’s possible that the two-thirds of Taobao retailers that didn’t take part in Double 12 ran out of inventory or turned to offline sales channels for the rest of the holiday shopping season. Retail logistics make it harder for smaller companies on Taobao to be as flexible on price as the big dogs on Tmall. They also can’t offer up the same kinds of amazing bargains Chinese consumers are now accustomed to.\\n\\n\\nHints that Whatsapp is expanding to the web: It looks like WhatsApp might be bringing its messaging service to the web. The rumors started shortly after the the co-founder of rival messaging app Telegram, Pavel Durov, told TechCrunch that he thought WhatsApp was working on a web version “since they tried to hire our web dev.” While WhatsApp has yet to make any official mention of a web version of its popular messaging app, a recent discovery by the team at AndroidWorld.nl appears to back up Durov’s suspicions. Hidden inside the code of a recent WhatsApp update is the mention of “WhatsApp Web.” It’s still not definite proof, but it certainly looks like the WhatsApp team is at least exploring some sort of web functionality.\\n\\n\\nIndia startup action: Bangalore-based Blowhorn offers an online marketplace focused on last mile logistics services: Mithun Srivatsa, director of operations, Walmart Labs, co-founded Blowhorn, an online marketplace for last mile logistics services, along with his classmate from NIT Nagpur Nikhil Shivaprasad (CTO), in November 2013. “Currently, mini-truck drivers suffer from inefficient utilisation, sometimes not getting a booking for a load to carry for a day or more. At the same time, consumers have ever-increasing needs to move things around the crowded streets of India’s major metros. We bring them together seamlessly,” said Srivatsa, CEO of Blowhorn. The Bangalore-based startup claims to be receiving a lot of demand from people buying from online classifieds sites like OLX and Quikr, as well other second hand goods groups on social media. The firm charges Rs 600 for the first hour and pro-rated every 10 minutes thereafter. Last month, the startup had raised an undisclosed amount in seed funding from impact investor Unitus Seed Fund, with participation from Tim Draper, founder and managing partner of Draper Associates. While the space is new and unexplored in India, there are examples of such startups globally. In Asia, Hong Kong-based GoGoVan provides similar services and has presence in Singapore and Taiwan, besides its home city.\\n\\n\\nSoftBank shrinks U.S. office, hurt by its Sprint investment, marking end of failed T-Mobile bid: Japan\\'s SoftBank Corp (9984.T) will soon downsize its Silicon Valley offices, people with knowledge of the matter said, signaling the company won\\'t revive efforts to buy T-Mobile U.S. Inc\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXiaomi Confirms It Has Suspended Sales In India, “open to working with Ericsson to resolve this matter amicably”:\\xa0Hugo Barra revealed the temporary pause in India, which is triggered by a patent suit brought against the company by Ericsson, via an update on Google+. Initially, Xiaomi told media it had not received a notice from the high court, but that situation has changed now. Xiaomi told TechCrunch yesterday that it is “open to working with Ericsson to resolve this matter amicably” so this situation may yet be remedied quickly and without too much disruption to its sales in India. Indeed, Ericsson has struck recent patent deals with a number of India-based phone makers, and it may be holding out for a similar arrangement with Xiaomi.\\n\\n\\nSnapdeal has acquired Wishpicker, a recommendations platform for gift purchases: Snapdeal says this is the fifth acquisition it has made so far.

Now, according to new reports from varying sources, Amazon’s flagship application’s listing is no longer available via search from within Google Play, though its direct link is still live. Additionally, there’s now a newly launched application called Amazon Shopping which looks much like the original application, but no longer includes the Appstore section. The change was first spotted by German site Caschys Blog who also received a statement from Amazon which claims that this is related to a September update that brought Amazon’s Prime Instant Video to Android users. That update involved having users update to or install the newest version of the main Amazon app, then download the Amazon Instant Video Player app afterwards, in order to watch Prime Instant Video on their Android devices.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCoverage here, here, here and everywhere that Instagram is now bigger than Twitter, will launch verified accounts: Instagram announced Wednesday that it now has 300 million monthly active users, up 50 percent in just nine months. That makes the service, a photo- and video-sharing app owned by Facebook, more popular than Twitter, which had 284 million monthly active users as of the third quarter. More than 70 percent of Instagram’s users are outside the United States, the company said Instagram users are highly engaged with the service, with users interacting with posts at 18 times the rate they do with Facebook posts, according to a report issued last month by the research firm L2. Kevin Systrom, Instagram’s chief executive, said in a statement that the service was also going to begin verifying the Instagram accounts of celebrities, athletes and brands. Verified accounts will be identified with a badge so that fans know that they are really what they say they are. Instagram is also cracking down on spam accounts, deleting them from the service instead of just deactivating them.\\n\\n\\nTwitter slipping: behind Instagram in users, behind Yahoo in 2015 mobile revenues, out of Glassdoor\\'s top 50 best employers list: “Instagram is adding an average of 360k new active users per day; For comparison Twitter is adding 160k new users per day,” Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W Baird & Co., said today in a tweet. Twitter declined to comment on Instagram’s announcement. San Francisco-based Twitter has recently been on a campaign to promote its prospects after several quarters of slowing user growth and questions about whether it can ever reach the scale of Facebook, which has about 1.3 billion members. Monthly active user count at Twitter rose 23 percent in the third quarter, down from 24 percent growth the prior quarter. \\n\\n\\nReliance Capital is set to sell its 16% in Yatra.com for INR 500 Crore; Yatra valuation ~ USD 500 Million: per cent stake in travel portal Yatra.com for an estimated Rs 500 crore ($80 million) and is in talks with two-three international investors. The deal would mark an over 12x appreciation for this investment by Reliance Capital, the financial services arm of Anil Ambani-led business conglomerate Reliance Group, which had acquired a 16 per cent stake in the online travel company for Rs 40 crore in 2006. While the spokesperson did not give further details, sources said Reliance Cap aims to close the transaction in four-six weeks and the deal would put the total valuation of Yatra.com at around $500 million (Rs 3,000 crore). In the fast-growing Indian online travel business, Yatra.com competes with NASDAQ-listed MakeMyTrip, which commands a market value of $1.2 billion. During the last fiscal 2013-14, MakeMyTrip is estimated to have clocked total transaction value of $1.38 billion on its platforms, as against $763 million by Yatra.

Separately, US-based ecommerce giant eBay plans to increase its ownership in Indonesia’s MetraPlasa from 40 percent to 49 percent, local media outlet Berita Satu reports. “Ebay can increase to 49 percent and they can also have the option to become the majority shareholder. There are stages for them to get there and they want to do it quickly. But I can not disclose anything more,” said Telkom’s acting president director Indra Utoyo in Jakarta on Monday. Ebay remains a strategic partner for Telkom as it will allow for future cross-border trading, and for products on the Blanja site to eventually be sold overseas. Blanja claims to have one million products on its site from only 600 sellers. It recieves a mere 50,000 visitors per day. “Currently, the revenue contribution of ecommerce to our business remains small,” says Utoyo. “But we estimate the contribution could reach 10 percent within two to three years.”\\n\\n\\nCoupang, Korea\\'s Amazon\" raises USD 300M, valuation > USD 1B, GMV runrate USD 2.2B: Coupang, a fast-growing e-commerce company in South Korea, has raised $300 million of additional financing to aid its expansion plans. While Bom Kim, the chief executive, declined to disclose the company’s valuation, he said it was higher than the roughly $1 billion price tag the company achieved in its previous financing round. He also said the company now had about $500 million of cash in the bank. Coupang, based in Seoul, calls itself the Amazon of Korea. In addition to selling its own inventory, the company allows third-party merchants to sell through its site. While it competes in Korea with eBay and a site called 11th Street, Coupang says its competitive edge stems from its focus on ordering through mobile devices and from its delivery network. Like Amazon, Coupang has built its own warehouses, called fulfillment centers. But it has gone a step beyond Amazon by also employing its own delivery workers, whom it calls “Coupang men.” (Mr. Kim said the fleet includes some women as well.) These workers, who try to build relationships with customers by doing things like leaving handwritten notes, can often deliver packages on the day they are ordered. Mr. Kim, 36, who started Coupang in late 2010 after dropping out of Harvard Business School, said the company was now generating gross sales — the total value of goods passing through the site — of $2.2 billion on an annualized basis. He said roughly one in three people in South Korea had downloaded the company’s app.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n12 small Indian startups: Price comparison site YouTellMe, online testing platform Youth4Work and 10 startups picked for TiE Bangalore’s 2nd accelerator batch: EventsHigh: aggregates information related to events and allows users to explore them based on their interests and locality.

But those interested in buying those items can submit their bids to sellers to get what they want -- a part of the online commerce world normally associated with eBay. All in all, the company said in a release, around 150,000 items on the site have the flexible pricing options -- a number that should expand in 2015, Amazon said. The program isn\\'t designed to send prices sky-high, as with eBay and other auction site listings, however. In a press release, Amazon says that the \"Make an Offer\" option give consumers a new option to \"buy items at even lower prices.\" Sellers will indicate that they\\'re willing to sell their item for less than a listed price, giving consumers the option to argue the price down, rather than try to outbid each other. Buyers and sellers negotiate over e-mail, where they can propose, accept, reject or counter each others\\' offers.\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft Azure launches its government cloud offering for the US: Microsoft today announced that its Azure Government cloud computing service for federal, state, local and tribal U.S. governments is now generally available after more than a year of being in preview. This means the service is now open to all U.S. government customers. There are no more preview programs and the service is also now open for all workloads. By default, Azure Government ensures that all data stays within the U.S. and within data centers and networks that are physically isolated from the rest of Microsoft’s cloud computing solution. It’s in compliance with FedRAMP, a mandatory government-wide program that prescribes a standardized way to carry out security assessments for cloud services. It also supports a wide range of other compliance standards, including HIPAA and the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS), which is meant to keep safe fingerprint and background-check data that has to be shared with other agencies. Amazon has long been offering a similar service for government authorities with its GovCloud. \\n\\n\\nUber\\'s run of bad news continues (India, Spain, Thailand, the Netherlands); India cracks down on unregistered taxis, Uber defiant: A run of bad news for Uber continued on Tuesday, when Spain and Thailand ordered the ride-sharing service to cease operations in the two countries. In Madrid, a commercial court judge sided with a taxi association complaint, saying that Uber must cease driving in Spain until a lawsuit contesting its right to operate can be heard. In Bangkok, the Thai transport authorities ordered Uber to shut down after finding that its drivers lacked the registration and insurance needed to operate commercial vehicles, Reuters reported. Just one day earlier, officials in New Delhi, the Indian capital, ordered Uber to cease its operations there after one of its drivers was accused of raping a passenger. Also on Monday, a Dutch appeals court upheld that Uber drivers who transport passengers without a taxi license are violating Dutch law. The court said the company would be subject to immediate fines if it continued to operate its UberPop service, which enables any licensed driver with a car and Uber-issued device to pick up passengers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook may finally be getting serious about search - launches personalized keyword search today: Two years after debuting semantic “My friends who…” search for people, places, and photos on the web, Graph Search is rolling out on iOS in the US along with a new keyword search option for dredging up old News Feed posts by friends. Product manager Rousseau Kazi tells me Facebook’s personalized search results are focused first on helping people rediscover thoughts, experiences, and memories they saw in feed. Still, queries for “dentist” or “burrito” could surface recommendations from friends that compete with Google results. Meanwhile, a search for “Michael Brown” or “101 traffic” could surface a feed of recent mentions or news articles by friends, similar to Twitter. There will be no ads on Facebook’s mobile search or any new keyword ads. But since keywords can carry lucrative purchase intent, I’d bet Facebook experiments with ads here eventually to see if they could become real revenue generators. Businesses would surely be willing to pay to insert themselves into results for “restaurant” or “lawyer”.\\n\\n\\nChinese provider of free public wifi in exchange for ads gets $49M investment from Tencent, Dianpin: WiWide, a Chinese startup that provides public wifi networks to stores and restaurants, has received an RMB 300 million (US$49 million) series C funding round from Tencent and Dianping, according to TechNode. Over 500 domestic and international franchises use WiWide in China, including Starbucks, Burger King, and several airports. Its advertising clients include Jaguar, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Nokia, Lenovo, and HTC, whose ads get pushed to customers once they connect. Altogether, the company runs over 30,000 hotspots. WiWide offers an end-to-end solution, meaning it provides the routers and other hardware, network architecture, professional installation, and a dashboard application for businesses to keep track of connected customers.\\n\\n\\nA respected commentator asks - How many people really care about Google Services? \"I ask these questions because when looking at the future of Android and of Google, Gmail, maps, calendar, Google Now and all the other Google Services come up a lot. They come up both as indicators of Google\\'s strength and as levers for Google to retain power of Android OEMs, since it can withhold these services from a device more or less at will. I, and the kind of people who spend time thinking about these issues, tend to assume that, well, maps and calendars and email and so on are very important, because we use them all day, and that the tight integration of Google services is a good reason to buy an Android phone and their absence would make it unsalable. What I wonder, then, is how much one can say that these Google services are very broad but very shallow. They address a need that a small number of people feel very deeply but that many more people may feel only occasionally, if ever. We know, for example, that the typical Gmail user gets five emails a day, \\'mostly commercial\\'. How committed are they to Google? The obvious exception here is an app store - but this is one area where it might be possible to make an alternative without having Google\\'s vast machine learning engine as a back-end - Amazon has tried, and in China (where Google is effectively absent) there are at least half a dozen.\"\\n\\n\\nCreative agencies maybe feeling the squeeze as brands opt for web video shops to \"just get stuff done\": Increasingly, marketers are going directly to online production houses to produce Web video content. \"The Internet has changed everything in terms of how consumers find, curate and watch branded content, and this is putting tremendous pressure on traditional ad agencies,\" noted ShareAbility CEO Tim Staples. \"Succeeding at YouTube requires an expertise that most general ad agencies don’t have, and the smart ones are not willing to risk a $50 million account for a $500,000 piece of content.\" Typically, these simple concept ideas are not related to a broader campaign, meaning they don’t need the full strategy and cost of hiring a traditional agency, explained Altimeter analyst Rebecca Lieb. As an added bonus, digital studios are adept in turning things around quickly and know what’s viral. \"It\\'s about hiring execution,\" she said. \"Agencies do a lot of strategy and ideation, which is sometimes not what you need. Sometimes, you just need to get stuff done.\"\\n\\n\\nBanned in Delhi, sued 4 days after launch by the city of Portland, Uber fights on: [Delhi] Delhi Police investigators have been scathing in describing their dealings with Uber. Mr. Verma said he was unable to find any contact number or email address for Uber on its web pages and finally located its headquarters by booking an Uber cab and asking to be taken to the company\\'s head office, which turned out to be several rooms in a hotel. He said he was not able to get any information about Friday\\'s bookings for five hours because the database was located in New York. Mr. Verma also said that Uber had failed to demand that Mr. Yadav show a badge, which can only be acquired by submitting to a criminal background check. He said Uber had registered Mr. Yadav under an inaccurate residential address, had not registered his vehicle as a cab, and had not installed a global positioning system in the vehicle, which is mandatory for commercial taxis. Uber, which has been valued by investors at more than $40 billion, is running into similar problems in cities in other countries. A Dutch court on Monday prohibited the UberPop service, which links clients with drivers who do not have professional licenses, from operating in the Netherlands. The UberPop service has been banned in the German cities of Berlin and Hamburg, and London\\'s main taxi association has brought lawsuits against Uber and a number of its drivers. Lawmakers in Thailand and Vietnam have banned the service, and the city government in Seoul has said it plans to do the same. Uber just launched in Portland on Friday, but the City’s Transportation Bureau has already sued, alleging Uber violates licensing laws\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe massive\\xa0hacker attack on Sony, possibly by groups linked to North Korea, continues to dominate headlines;\\xa0security flaws exposed:\\xa0North Korea says its supporters may be behind Sony attack:The attack shut down most of the studio\\'s network for more than a week and hackers have released sensitive data over the Internet, including employee salaries and Social Security numbers along with high-quality digital versions of several unreleased films. A key weakness was that few security measures existed between the computers of the Japanese company’s divisions around the world, so hackers could move with relative ease throughout the corporation, said the person, who asked to remain anonymous because the information is confidential. The most recent attacks suggests Sony hasn’t done enough since the last episode. The company put itself and others at risk by not putting passwords or encryption on the files that would have made them more difficult for hackers to open, according to Todd Feinman, chief executive officer of Identity Finder LLC, a New York-based provider of data management software.\\n\\n\\nFacebook Video and YouTube are now equals in the video ad market, say some: \"YouTube and Facebook are equal players now, or at least close to it,\" Ron Amram, senior media director of marketing, Heineken USA, told Adweek. \"What we\\'re finding is that we have to consider Facebook as the key video partner going forward because not only does it have the reach but the effectiveness. Here\\'s why he\\'s bullish on Facebook\\'s nascent promos: While pushing Heineken Light to 21 to 34 year olds in the United States in October, the brand\\'s digital spots—in three days—were exposed to the newfeeds of 35 million Facebook users, producing 5.5 million views, according to Amram. That means 16 percent of the people reached watched the spot. \"This is the first time we\\'ve looked at [Facebook] as part of our digital video strategy overall,\" he said. \"It complements television very well but also goes beyond it.\" To Amram\\'s last point, the 15-second auto-play ads featured the same Neil Patrick Harris work from Wieden + Kennedy that broke on TV in July. One minute and 48-second commercials were also pushed on the platform. \"Putting it on Facebook re-accelerated it for us,\" Amram said. \"August and September were good, but October was even better.\" \"Facebook over-delivered on what we anticipated,\" he said. Additionally, he had postive data when it came to still promos on Facebook. Amram said sister brand Dos Equis got a $3.35 back for every dollar spent during the weeks leading up to Cinco de Mayo last spring, which helped the brand lift sales by 6.6 percent year over year.\\n\\n\\nIndia\\'s smartphone market is surging (23M in Q3 2014, 82% Y/Y), even as China\\'s reaches saturation (105M in Q3 2014, 10.8%): The latest figures from IDC show that smartphone shipments in India grew 82 percent in the past 12-month period, while China saw growth of just 10.8 percent. Admittedly, India is still a small-ish market in relative terms, with an estimated 23.3 million smartphones shipped to retailers in Q3 2014, versus 105 million in China. Basic, non-smart phones still account for the majority of mobile sales in India, but that means a seismic shift is now underway to Android, iOS, and Windows Phone devices. Cheaper Android phones are helping push this forward in the very price-sensitive market. The ratio of feature phones to smartphones shipped in India is now 68:32, which has changed a lot from 78:22 at the end of last year, and 90:10 at the end of 2012.\\n\\n\\nUber terms of service face scrutiny\\xa0as firm\\xa0faces the possibility of legal action in India following arrest of rape suspect:\\xa0Madhur Verma, New Delhi police deputy commissioner, said that police will also take legal action against Uber — valued at $40 billion — for failure to run checks on the driver’s background and whether he had an adequate GPS device in his car. The police are taking legal advice before deciding whether it would be a criminal or civil case. Earlier reports suggest that the suspect had disabled GPS during the incident, which occurred late on Friday night or early Saturday morning. The suspect allegedly parked the car in a secluded area after the passenger, said to be in her mid-twenties, fell asleep. He then raped her and threatened her life if she reported anything. Shockingly enough, Uber’s terms of service don’t necessarily protect against this. You can have a read through it right here, if you’d like, but the main argument is this: Uber is not a transportation company, but rather a technology service that matches seekers of transportation (riders) with providers of transportation (drivers). By using Uber, and accepting the obligatory ToS, you are acknowledging that each and every driver that picks you up in any city in the world is a third-party (not Uber), and thus, Uber is not responsible for any of their actions. This is hardly the first time that a dispute (to put it lightly) has arisen between an Uber driver and a passenger or pedestrian. One man was hit over the head with a hammer, and a six-year-old girl was killed when hit by a driver. This isn’t even the first rape allegation against an Uber driver.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber raises $1.2B of new funding, valuation of $40B (>Tesla,\\xa04x of AirBnb)\\xa0also raises\\xa0$1B convertible debt\\xa0(with hint of IPO less than 4 years away):\\xa0Uber closed a new $1.2 billion round of financing on Thursday, with investors valuing the company at a staggering $40 billion. That puts a new mountain of cash on top of the $1.5 billion that Uber had already raised. The company is now valued at four times that of other elite Silicon Valley startups, such as Airbnb Inc. Uber’s value also dwarfs Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA), which has a market capitalization of $28.6 billion. General Motors Co., the largest U.S. automaker, has a $53.2 billion market capitalization. Uber is also building its finances with a more than $1 billion convertible debt sale to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)’s wealth management clients. The clients are getting a chance to buy a six-year bond in Uber that will convert into equity at a 20 percent to 30 percent discount to the company’s valuation at the time of an initial public offering, said people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the details are private. Goldman Sachs isn’t investing its own money in the debt, said the people. The convertible bond carries a coupon that increases over time if Uber hasn’t gone public within 4 years, said the people. “It’s interesting that, with the convertible debt, Uber is putting itself under pressure to go public within 4 years,” Sanwal said.\\n\\n\\n\"Create-to-consume\" (aka \"Reply to unlock\") failed, so Facebook relaunches Slingshot with easier Discovery; to be (even) more like Snapchat: Facebook first launched Slingshot back in June with an innovative, if a bit friction-full, feature where you had to reply with a photo or video to see one a friend had sent you. It was one of the early releases from Facebook’s Creative Labs project for experimenting with mobile app design. While I found it fun at first, the annoyance of having to create to consume eventually whittled down the small initial user base, and I haven’t received a Sling in months. The update in September that dropped the reply-to-unlock requirement did nothing to reinvigorate the community.Today Facebook took yet another swipe at Snapchat with the re-release of its ephemeral sharing app Slingshot for iOS and Android. Now you follow people like on Twitter, but you can still privately message. If you pull down the camera, you’ll see a grid of shots from the last 24 hours by people you follow — a lot like Snapchat Stories. The difference is you can immediately see big visual previews of friends’ Slings rather than having to open them to reveal what they’ve been up to like on Snapchat. And spying the success of Snapchat Stories stars, Slingshot has a discovery center for finding cool people to follow. \\n\\n\\nYahoo\\'s mobile efforts paying off; will overtake Twitter in mobile ads next year, move to 3rd after Google, Facebook: Yahoo is now projected to be the largest gainer of U.S. mobile-ad market share between 2014 and 2016, according to new data from EMarketer Inc. out today. Yahoo’s mobile-ad slice will climb to 3.74 percent in 2015 and to 4.2 percent in 2016. While still tiny, it’s enough to push Yahoo ahead of current number three player Twitter, which will have 3.69 percent market share next year and 3.8 percent in 2016. Google Inc. (GOOG) and Facebook Inc. (FB) remain the biggest U.S. mobile-ad companies, with 35 percent and 17 percent shares next year respectively. The numbers show how an effort by Mayer to marshal resources and refocus the company on mobile is starting to pay off, making Yahoo relevant in a digital-advertising area that’s projected to reach almost $60 billion in the U.S. in 2018 from $19 billion this year. In October, Mayer broke out Yahoo’s mobile revenue for the first time, reporting third-quarter sales of more than $200 million, with gross revenue in mobile set to exceed $1.2 billion this year.\\n\\n\\nMobile shoppers care about: efficient checkout: As users take to mobile platforms in greater numbers, retailers are learning that small-screen shoppers are different: They buy fewer things and have less patience for a checkout process that is anything less than incredibly efficient. Also, while shoppers did plenty of browsing this holiday season on their cellphones, tablets and PCs still reigned for actually making purchases. Smartphones accounted for 34.7 percent of traffic on Black Friday, but just 11.8 percent of sales. \\xa0Also, bad signs for Google: Tablet shoppers were more likely to reach the company\\'s site through a search engine this holiday season, while smartphone users were more likely to come from Facebook or other social media.\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

Saavn launched its radio mode one year ago, and now it is taking requests from users who tweet to the @SaavnRadio account. The station will also mix in tracks that Saavn users are sharing to Twitter from the service, although the company said specific requests will be prioritized over social shares. Saavn Co-Founder and CEO Rishi Malhotra told TechCrunch in an interview that the radio feature already accounts for over half of all activity on the service and, since a large number of users are already active on Twitter, the union was a no-brainer for him. “Music streaming has always been an inherently social service, we [at Saavn] already see lots of activity from users worldwide and identified a natural opportunity to create a radio station. This puts the power of programming into our users’ hands,” he said. Malhotra also hinted that Saavn is preparing more social features next year, but he said that these new releases will be within the Saavn service itself, such as collaborative playlists.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon maybe on the hook for in-app purchases made by kids without parental authorization - burden of proof rests with Amazon: A federal judge won\\'t dismiss the Federal Trade Commission\\'s lawsuit against Amazon over the company\\'s practice of billing parents for in-app purchases their children made without parental approval. The lawsuit alleges that Amazon failed to stop children from spending millions of dollars of their parents\\' money for virtual items in online games and other apps on devices such as Amazon\\'s Kindle Fire tablet. Some of these individual purchases cost as much as $100 each. Amazon argues that it adequately warns customers when an app allows for in-app purchases. It also says that the FTC couldn\\'t prove that the bills that the kids racked up were \"unauthorized\" by parents. But Judge John C. Coughenour disagreed with that reasoning Monday, saying Amazon may still have violated federal laws against unfair billing, whether the charges were authorized or not. In any event, Coughenour added, it\\'s Amazon\\'s responsibility to prove that the charges were authorized, and it has not done that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSoftBank Invests $250M In GrabTaxi, Uber’s Archrival In Southeast Asia; valuation > $1B: Neither party has confirmed what the deal values GrabTaxi at, but the company’s valuation is likely to exceed the $1 billion mark. The duo did confirm that SoftBank has become GrabTaxi’s largest investor. The round is the highest raise for a startup in Southeast Asia to date — Rocket Internet companies aside — and it is GrabTaxi’s fourth funding activity this calendar year, taking it past $320 million in capital from investors. GrabTaxi’s previous $65 million round closed in October and was led by Tiger Global — which also invested in Uber rival Ola — while GGV Capital led a $15 million raise in May. Its $10 million-plus Series A was announced in April. GrabTaxi was founded in Malaysia in 2012, has over 500 staff and is live in 17 cities across six countries in Southeast Asia: Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and Indonesia. Its core offering is a service that connects registered taxis with would-be passengers via its app — thus working with the existing industry rather than against it — but it also offers an Uber-like private car service and is trialling motorbike taxis in Vietnam.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber\\'s take on hiring tech talent: tie up with a collective - then hire the team and open an engineering office around them: To spearhead its mobile growth, Uber is setting up a mobile development shop in Amsterdam, led by one of its earliest employees and staffed by a set of new hires: a team of Dutch developers who originally worked on Uber’s Spotify integration and have served as advisors to the company since 2009. Uber has effectively taken on 10 former employees from Dutch firm Moop.me, which effectively functions as a collective of engineers and designers. Uber has not acquired the whole agency, because Moop’s people have also taken on other projects that have very little synergy with what Uber is today. Those projects, and Moop, will continue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStripe doubled its valuation to $3.5B; payment start-up that partners with Apple Pay, Alipay, Facebook, Twitter: Stripe, an e-commerce start-up based in San Francisco, announced on Tuesday that it had raised a new $70 million round in venture capital. The round, which includes Sequoia Capital and Thrive Capital, values Stripe at $3.5 billion, twice the amount the company was valued at less than one year ago. The company, which was founded by brothers, John and Patrick Collison, in 2009, offers payment processing services for small and medium-size businesses that want to sell items online. It competes with the likes of companies like PayPal, which has long dominated the online payments industry. The company has also secured partnerships with Facebook and Twitter — which allow for users to buy things directly inside of these social platforms — and recently announced a deal with Alipay, one of the largest e-commerce platforms in China. Stripe plans to use its new capital to continue to add to its existing staff of 180 employees, and push harder into international markets. It also plans to bolster the set of tools it offers to developers who use Stripe to process payments for their businesses.

This hybrid approach means companies can wait for years before they consider moving their most sensitive core financial systems to the cloud computers. It also gives them the option of never having to move. Secondly, European clients demand that their data remain stored locally in European data center, a requirement IBM has met by building seven public cloud data centers across Europe in London, Amsterdam, Paris and one in Germany, with another to follow there shortly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTumblr adds action buttons - simpler than Twitter buy button, but no payment integration: Tumblr, which has apparently overtaken Instagram as the fastest-growing social media property — has today announced a test of a new feature that will give it more interactivity, and more of a social commerce spin. Users that post links from a selection of sites — Etsy, Artsy, Kickstarter and Do Something — will now automatically see action buttons appear in the top right corner of the posts for people to “buy”, “browse”, “pledge”, or “do something”. For now, the actions are limited to these four sites. Down the road, if Tumblr decides to integrate the buttons into links from a wider range of properties — taking in e-commerce behemoths like Amazon and eBay, for example — it could feasibly become much more of a competitor against the likes of Pinterest, Facebook and others, positioning Tumblr not just as a place to consume content but to transact, too. the buttons on Tumblr are somewhat reminiscent of the buttons that Twitter has been adding to Tweets,but Tumblr’s buttons are much more simple for anyone (not just businesses or power users) to create — they come up literally when you a copy/paste of a link. And while Twitter has integrated with payments companies to underpin its own buy button, Tumblr’s implementation is, well, a bit more rough and tumble. It’s unclear, for example, if Tumblr is getting an affiliate cut on any traffic that it sends to these sites as a result of the button. If anything, it feels more like Tumblr has added these buttons to test the waters, looking at how such a feature might potentially get monetised in the future, perhaps as an ad unit for businesses using the button. The offering is desktop only — not mobile.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSmart home-audio market continues to heat up - Sonos raises $130M: \\xa0After Amazon\\'s launch of Echo, and Apple\\'s purchase of Beats, Sonos, in the smart home audio business since 2002, just raised $130 million, according to an SEC filing. The funding adds to Sonos’ previous $325 million, bringing it to around $455 million. That makes it a very, very well capitalized startup. It’s so big that probably no one but Google or Apple could afford to acquire it. Considering Apple’s personal audio buyout of Beats’ headphones business, and Google’s invasion of the smart home, either could be a smart alternative to an IPO for Sonos. Sonos has been steadily improving its core product — home stereo systems where each room can be separately controlled to wirelessly play music from online and local sources. It ditched its proprietary controller to let you use iOS and Android devices as remotes, and eliminated the need for its “Bridge” gadget you had to plug into your wireless router. Alongside Spotify, Pandora, iTunes, Deezer, Sirius XM, and your own music library, Sonos recently added support for SoundCloud and Google Music. What’s left is to become a household name. Sonos has already begun buying expensive commercials on primetime music TV shows like The X Factor. It’s also running huge outdoor ad campaigns on the sides of buildings in Europe\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon has installed 15,000 robots in 10 of its 50 US warehouses. (article here, video here): \\xa0The robots are made by Kiva, acquired by Amazon in 2012 for 775M. Each robot weighs 320 lbs, and can carry 750 lbs. The robots are guided by stickers on the warehouse floors. This is fast and space-efficient: unloading a trailer now takes 30 minutes, instead of hours. Each warehouse can now hold up to 50% more inventory because racks can be placed closer together. The robots typically run for 2 hours before needing a recharge (which they do on their own). The robots can thus work 24x7 and fulfil an order every 20seconds. In some cases, the robots have allowed Amazon to get packages out the door in as little as 13 minutes from the pick stations, compared to about an hour and a half on average in older centers. The move comes at a cost. Amazon estimated in June 2013 that it would spend about $46 million to install Kiva robots at its warehouse in Ruskin, Florida, including $26.1 million for the equipment, according to company filings to local government.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor Uber, Airbnb, OpenTable, Customer Ratings also help rate the customer: Travelers are often asked to review their hotel, restaurant and car service. But increasingly, it goes both ways. Drivers for Uber and Lyft, for example, rate their passengers from one to five stars at the end of each ride. If a rider receives three stars or fewer, the driver and passenger will not be paired up again. And at OpenTable, the restaurant booking system, customers are banned if they do not show for a reservation too many times. While guest-tracking systems are generally for internal use only, guests who use the Airbnb online booking service to find lodging may find themselves publicly reviewed. This allows potential hosts to see how a guest was perceived by previous ones before agreeing to allow that person to stay in their home. The online dining reservation system OpenTable allows a restaurant to identify guests who booked through the system. Using OpenTable, each restaurant can make private notes about the guests, like indicating table location preference or if they often send their food back. Those notes are not shared with other restaurants. “Overwhelmingly restaurants use the notes feature to enhance the hospitality experience for their guests,” said a spokeswoman, Tiffany Fox. She added that it will ban a customer who fails to show up for a reservation four times in a 12-month period. These are among the ways that sophisticated rating systems can turn on the customer, identifying the best and worst among them. The rating systems are allowing businesses to formalize a longstanding practice: focusing on their best customers. The worst customers “demand too much, complain too much and cost too much,” said Christopher Muller, professor of hospitality management at Boston University. Beyond that, he said, bad clients make employees unhappy. Companies, he said, do better by spending time on their best and most profitable patrons. “It sounds draconian, but not all customers are created equal,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber switches fully to Paytm wallet-based pay mode, discontinues Indian card payments: Global online car hire service major Uber Technologies Inc has stopped accepting credit and debit card payments from cards issued in India, and will now only allow payments made through Paytm wallet in the country, the company announced in a blog post. Last month, Uber had partnered with Paytm, the digital goods and services marketplace owned by Noida-based One97 Communications Ltd, to integrate its payment system. With this integration, Uber can sidestep the regulations that require every transaction made with an Indian credit card to include two-factor authentication (2FA). Earlier, it had come under fire from Indian monetary authority RBI over its automated credit card based payment system.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUS offline retailers ran TV, radio ads targeting Alibaba: Several of the largest U.S. retailers warned that Alibaba Group Holding Inc may \"decimate\" local companies unless Congress closes tax loopholes for online retailers, singling out the Chinese company before it has even established a major American consumer presence. In TV and radio ads over the weekend, the Alliance for Main Street Fairness, which includes Best Buy, Target, JC Penney and other major chains, called on Congress to end special tax treatment for Alibaba and other online giants. \"Main Street will never look the same,\" it said. The ad marks one of the biggest public marketing campaigns against a Chinese company that handles more e-commerce than Amazon and eBay combined, even though Alibaba only surfaced in the American consciousness after it went public in the world\\'s largest-ever IPO in September. U.S. retailers and industry analysts expect Alibaba to soon launch a service targeted at American consumers, armed with its IPO war chest.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThanksgiving sales shocker: fewer shoppers, lower spend-per-shopper send Thanksgiving weekend sales (online + offline) down 11% Y/Y to $50.9 billion, from $57.4 billion last year, according to preliminary survey results released Sunday by the National Retail Federation. Sales fell despite many stores’ opening earlier than ever on Thanksgiving Day. And though many retailers offered the same aggressive discounts online as they did in their stores, the web failed to attract more shoppers or spending over the four-day holiday weekend than it did last year, the group said. The average person who shopped over the weekend spent $159.55 at online retailers, down 10.2 percent from last year. Over all, 133.7 million people shopped or planned to shop at stores or online over the four-day weekend, 5.2 percent fewer than last year, the federation said. And shoppers spent an average of $380.95 over the four days, 6.4 percent less than the $407.02 they spent last year. Executives at the retail federation, which had predicted strong growth in sales this holiday season, appeared at a loss to fully explain the drop-off. Black Friday itself may be waning in importance, as retailers increasingly offer deep discounts days, and even weeks, before the traditional year-end sales period. That means many people may have simply done their shopping earlier and stayed home during the Thanksgiving weekend. But even there, the picture was not clear: Mr. Shay said that people also might be holding out for even better deals as the season progressed. He said that the continuous sales had conditioned consumers to expect better deals the longer they waited. “Holiday sales are now a marathon, not a sprint.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon\\'s play in after-sale services - among the highest profit margin revenue streams for retailers: Amazon publicly introduced an early release of Selling Services, which we had previously mentioned the company was working on a few months ago. Amazon is developing a marketplace that offers after-sale services such as car alarm installation, iPhone repair, and computer hardware setup to consumers buying relevant products. Today, the marketplace is available in 15 early rollout cities, including New York City and Lexington, Kentucky. For each product, Amazon will list the available services next to the listing, guaranteeing visibility and even potentially increasing sales among customers who are unsure if they can install or use a product. Geek Squad, which was founded by Robert Stephens in 1994 and sold to Best Buy in 2002, is perhaps the most prominent example of a success in this domain. As the Minneapolis Star Tribune wrote last year about the hometown retailer, “Over the past decade, Geek Squad has been a cash cow for Best Buy. […A]nalysts estimate Geek Squad generates a gross profit margin of 40 to 50 percent based on a minimum annual revenue of $2 billion, or about 4 percent of Best Buy’s total revenue of $50 billion.” Amazon will share with Geek Squad has one critical advantage that many other startups in the domain lack: point-of-sale access.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow Facebook plans to become one of the most powerful tools in politics: The end goal for the company seems clear: Replace, as much as possible, expensive, blanketed television advertising with much more immediate, much more specific ads appearing in users\\' feeds -- and then cash a whole lot of checks. Assuming you have a Facebook account, which you do, Facebook knows your email address. It probably knows your name, your birthday, where you work, where you worked, and who you\\'re friends with. It knows far more than that, of course, both directly and indirectly. Facebook\\'s partner in the effort Acxiom, also provides a wide swath of other data to Facebook, beyond what you\\'ve entered on the site or \"liked.\" This allows campaigns (as it does other advertisers) to target very, very specific groups of people linked tightly to the campaign\\'s voter file. One of the best practices for campaign communication is to sandwich messages, layering a communication (like a piece of mail or a TV spot) with some other spur (like an email or a Facebook ad) both before and after. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLazada raises $250M Led By Temasek; valuation at $1.25B; H1 2014 GMV $91M (+202% Y/Y): The round is lead by Singapore’s Temasek Holdings, which manages a $100-billion-plus portfolio and this year invested in another Amazon rival: Snapdeal in India. Lazada operates in six countries in Southeast Asia — Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam — largely in tandem with Zalora, another well-backed e-commerce service started by Rocket Internet. This new funding round takes Lazada to more than $700 million in money from investors. Its most recent round was also $250 million back in December 2013, which included an interesting strategic investment from UK retail giant Tesco. Together, Zalora and Lazada have probably raised around $1 billion in funding, although the value of some rounds were left undisclosed. \\xa0Raw figures about its business did reach the public domain this summer, however, as part of Rocket Internet’s IPO in Germany. According to a filing reported by Tech In Asia, Lazada brought in $91.4 million in the first six months of 2014, generating 1.8 million orders from 1.4 million active users. Those modest returns perhaps explain why it has been placing more emphasis on its marketplace. Lazada says its marketplace now accounts for 70 percent of its revenue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAn interesting linguistic analysis of online reviews: In general, the length of a review corresponded with an item’s price. The most frequent interjections were “wow,” “yeah,” “yuck,” “yikes,” “sheesh,” “yum” and “yippee.” Slang terms that showed up most often were “meh,” “whatever” and “the bomb.” And adjectives were not always what they seemed. Wherever it appeared, the word “delicious” was always unambiguously positive, but not so with “good.” On all five sites, “good” often appeared very close to the words “but” and “not,” indicating ambivalence. Reviewers often wrote statements like “It’s good, but I’m not in love with it,” or “It’s good but not fall on the floor dance a jig good.” Among the most frequent three-word phrases, or three-grams, were “in the room” and “the front desk.” From these patterns, she surmised that consumers who stayed in hotels were about equally focused on the room’s quality as they were on customer service. Frequent four-grams included “in the middle of,” “the rest of the” and “at the end of.” That fits with Dr. Vásquez’s observation that when people write about hotels, recipes or diaper bags, they like to tell stories. Narratives, she found, are more likely to appear in negative reviews than in positive ones.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUsing mobile apps to interact with merchandise: Using the Quikkly iOS or Android app, you scan what the company is calling an Action Tag — its own proprietary barcode-esque tech — and this immediately invokes an online action, such as listening to a track on Spotify, adding a contact to your address book, following someone on Twitter, or even connecting to a public WiFi spot. “When you see interesting stuff online and there’s a button to interact with it, you can click on it and something happens immediately. ‘Like’ on Facebook, ‘Follow’ on Twitter, add to Basket, listen to the song. In the physical world, it’s considerably more difficult,” says Quikkly CEO Fergal Walker. “If you’re interested, you would have to manually search for the item, hope you find the right one, and hope it works on your mobile. Quikkly removes the hassle and makes it as simple as it is online.” Quikkly also makes it pretty easy for anyone to create their own Action Tags, to be included on, for example, a business card, flyer or poster. This can be done via the website or mobile app. In fact, Quikkly is talking up its mobile-first play. To create an Action Tag, you simply select from a grid of pre-defined actions and fill in the needed details, such as URL and custom message.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUsing mobile apps to interact with toys: “We want to draw kids out of a two-dimensional screen, to blend a hands-on physical experience with an app, and make something new come to life,” said Vikas Gupta, a co-founder and the chief executive of Wonder Workshop, a start-up that makes Dash and Dot, two programmable toy robots that will begin shipping to early backers this holiday season. Dash and Dot are controlled by a mobile app, but they can also be taught to understand and react to events that happen in the real world — to play a real tune on a xylophone, say, or to bark in response to a child’s clap. Wonder Workshop is on the vanguard of a trend that threatens to overrun much of the traditional, mass-manufactured toy business.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter Experiments With Engagement Stats Directly In Tweets: Want to know just how many people actually care about what you’re tweeting? A new Twitter experiment spotted by ex-Twitter platform head Ryan Sarver will show many you how users are clicking on the links in the updates you post, with a handy link directly in the expanded Tweet view in the iOS application. As usual with Twitter’s features, this is limited to a small sample pool of users at first, but could roll out more widely if deemed successful. At the bottom of the tweet view, for those with this feature enabled, you’ll see a “View Analytics Details” link, which takes you directly to a synopsis of the overall interaction with said tweet, including overall impressions, and “engagements,” which includes how many people actually clicked on a link you shared, how many expanded the tweet and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber is causing the price of taxi licenses to crash; separately, a legal setback causes Uber to suspend operations in Nevada; ~1000 jobs might be at risk: The average price of an individual New York City taxi medallion fell to $872,000 in October, down 17 percent from a peak reached in the spring of 2013, according to an analysis of sales data. In other big cities, medallion prices are also falling, often in conjunction with a sharp decline in sales volume. In Chicago, prices are down 17 percent. In Boston, they’re down at least 20 percent, though it’s hard to establish an exact market price because there have been only five trades since July. In Philadelphia, the taxi authority recently scrapped a planned medallion auction. Most major American cities have long used a system to limit the number of operating taxicabs, typically a medallion system: Drivers must own or rent a medallion to operate a taxi, and the city issues a fixed number of them. In New York, which established its medallion system in 1937, that number is 13,437. The number has risen only gradually since the late 1990s, even as the city’s economy has boomed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJack Ma was in India; reportedly met Snapdeal co-founder Kunal Bahl: Ma is in India as part of a 99-member business delegation from his home town of Zejiang. He arrived in India last night and is reportedly scheduled to meet home grown e-commerce firm Snapdeal’s co-founder Kunal Bahl. There have been reports of Alibaba considering an investment in Snapdeal. Indeed the two firms already counts Japan’s SoftBank as a common and single largest investor.Jack Ma who was in a short India visit as part of a Chinese business delegation, said on Wednesday that Alibaba plans to invest more in the Indian e-commerce ecosystem and work with Indian entrepreneurs. India is one of the nine countries where Alibaba’s B2B marketplace is present. Besides China and India is it also present in the US, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea, Turkey, Taiwan and Vietnam. Its B2C ventures Taobao among others are presently only in home country China.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon UI too cluttered for you? Canopy has a Pinterest like skin on Amazon for curated community-driven shopping, recommendations : Canopy offers a cleaner, uncluttered interface for its shopping service – a big difference from Amazon.com itself. In its community, you can browse through products recommended by other users, see what’s trending, shop by category or brand, or even shop by personality type – the latter something that may come in handy as you struggle with your holiday shopping needs. Meanwhile, as you find products you like you can add these to collections within the app, which can later be accessed under your Profile section. Essentially, the service is like having a layer of curation overtop the massive Amazon.com catalog, presented in a more modern, almost Pinterest-like format.Canopy has seen around 22% average weekly growth in traffic over the past six months, says co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong, and 35% weekly growth in gross revenue. (The company declined to go into detail on customer numbers or revenue figures, however.) Currently, Canopy makes money via affiliate fees, not product placements or ads, which has allowed the company to bootstrap its service to where it is today.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZomato is monetizing traffic using geo-targeted ads on its apps: Restaurant and event-listing site Zomato.com, run by Gurgaon-based Zomato Media Pvt Ltd, has added a new revenue stream by introducing advertisements on its mobile app. The revenue model is based on hyper-local advertising related to the user search criteria. What this basically means is that users searching for restaurants in a particular area will see ads for other relevant dining establishments in and around that location. According to the company, this allows restaurants to target customers already searching for dining options in their area. The new service is available across Zomato apps on the Android, iOS and Windows platforms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSamsung announces $2B buyback; some businesses to be exited; generational shift underway - shares surge: Shares of South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd opened sharply higher on Thursday on the news that it will buy back $2 billion of its own stock. Samsung shares were up 5.8 percent as of (7.02 a.m. EST) after opening 6 percent higher. Samsung announced the buyback plan, its first since 2007, after market close on Wednesday.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon is circling Jabong; potential deal size ~$1-1.2B, two sources privy to the development told Techcircle.in. According to a source, the meeting took place very recently and it has not even been a week. Restructuring would be complicated: Jabong is an inventory-based e-tailer, where foreign investment is not allowed at present. Another source cited above said that Amazon would keep Jabong as a separate property post the acquisition. “It (deal) would be very much on the lines of Amazon’s acquisition of Zappos in the US,” he said. Jabong, which is one of the two top lifestyle e-tailers in the country along with Flipkart owned Myntra, reported gross merchandise value (GMV) of Rs 509.5 crore from 3.197 million orders in the January-June 2014 period. This marked a three-fold rise over the previous year. If it maintains the same growth through the rest of the year it may end with GMV of around Rs 1,300-1,500 crore for the year ending March 31, 2015. Accepted fair valuation in e-com space internationally is pegged at 3.5x sales which would value Jabong at around Rs 5,000 crore. Jabong could be looking to drive a hard bargain given the strategic play of Amazon in India and significance of the deal to win in the high stakes game in the country.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter launches Twitter Offers, Which Link To Your Credit Or Debit Card; Separately Twitter\\'s CFO commits a DM Fail: Companies will be able to offer cashback rewards in their tweets, and those rewards will tie directly into consumers’ credit and debit cards. The card-based approach should offer some significant advantages. If you see an offer in your timeline (to use the example in the screenshot above, it might be $2 back on a $5 purchase at a coffee shop), you should be able to add it to your card without leaving Twitter. Then when you go into the store, you don’t need to change your behavior — instead of bringing a coupon, you just pay with that card and the cashback payment should show up on your statement shortly after. A Twitter spokesperson said the card integration was already built by CardSpring, which Twitter acquired in July.Meanwhile, this gives businesses a way to track when their Twitter ads are actually driving consumers to make purchases in the store. From a security standpoint, Twitter says your card information will be encrypted and can be removed from your account at any time. Twitter Offers are being tested initially on desktop and mobile in the United States. The post says Twitter will be working with “a handful of brands” to test these offers in holiday-related promotions, and it will announce those brands “in the near future.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber is close to a round of financing at $35-$40B valuation: T. Rowe Price Group Inc. is in discussions to be a new investor, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the details are private. Existing investor Fidelity Investments is also set to participate in the funding, they said. Uber is raising at least $1 billion, the people said. The financing hasn’t closed and the terms and investor group may still change, one of the people said. T. Rowe previously considered investing in Uber and may still end up passing this time, two of the people said. If Uber completes the funding, a valuation of $35 billion to $40 billion would more than double its $17 billion value from a June financing. At the time, the valuation was a record for a U.S. technology startup in a direct investment round. That put Uber at the front of a pack of elite U.S. technology startups that are valued in the eleven-digit range, including Airbnb Inc. and Dropbox Inc. Such valuations are spreading internationally. In China, smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. is in talks for a funding round that would value it at $40 billion to $50 billion, people familiar with the matter have said.\\n\\n\\nTumblr Overtakes Instagram As Fastest-Growing Social Platform, Snapchat Is The Fastest-Growing App; Facebook saturated: While Tumblr and Pinterest appear to have seen the most growth, they are not seeing as much use when it comes to frequency, where the numbers almost appear to invert. With 1.35 billion active monthly users, Facebook continues to be the world’s largest social network by some margin, but \\xa0when it comes to picking up new users, it appears to have reached a saturation point. Research out today from the Global Web Index notes that Tumblr’s active user base in the last six months grew by 120%, while Facebook’s grew by only 2%. \\xa0And in overall member growth, Pinterest took the lead with 57% growth while Facebook’s member base grew by 6%. In mobile apps specifically, while Facebook is the largest app today, Snapchat — with an emphasis on teen and 20-something users — is the fastest growing of them all, up 56% this year. It is however followed closely by Facebook Messenger and Instagram — a sign of not just how Facebook’s mobile apps continue to represent the company’s growth drivers, but also how its push to drive more users to the standalone app by cutting out Messaging from the main app has helped it grow. China continues to be dominated by home-grown social networks. Sina Weibo, Qzone and Tencent Weibo lead, while Youku and Tudou round out the top 5.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

The company will offer a money-back guarantee on its services and will do background checks on any service provider that it lists on the site. Every handyman or woman will have to liability insurance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon is using kiosks on the NY Metro as scan-and-shop physical pop-up stores: Earlier this year, design firm Control Group partnered with New York\\'s Metropolitan Transportation Authority to roll out large digital kiosks underground that display maps of the city\\'s transit systems. Today, Amazon is the first advertiser to use those kiosks as digital pop-up stores to drive sales of holiday gifts. Amazon\\'s promos are running on 100 digital 47-inch screens in 12 major hubs in New York, including Grand Central Station, Union Square and Brooklyn\\'s Barclays Center. Collectively, the kiosks target 1.2 million riders per day. Half of the screens are placed on subway platforms and the other half are near entrances and high-volume areas. Creative content on Amazon\\'s ads differs between the two areas: Ads in the mezzanine area focus on branding while promos near trains drive sales. The digital screens are swipe-able and let consumers browse through a curated list of electronic holiday gifts from brands like Bose, Samsung, Sony and Belkin. Each item can be tapped on for more information, which also pulls in real-time pricing. After finding a product they want, riders can scan a QR code or send a text message or email and receive an Amazon.com link, where they can buy the gift from a smartphone once they\\'re above ground. Amazon\\'s campaign runs through Dec. 23—the last day consumers can buy something online and have it delivered by Christmas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProduction and delivery bottlenecks are crimping Xiaomi\\'s growth - but its India focus has only intensified - will make locally, and launch Redmi Note in offline stores as well: Instead of expanding into 10 new markets this year, Xiaomi will enter just five. That means consumers in Brazil, Russia, Thailand, Mexico and Turkey will have to wait a bit longer. The problem? Production and delivery bottlenecks are slowing the no. 3 smartphone maker\\'s pursuit of Samsung Electronics and Apple. In the past two months, Beijing-based Xiaomi has had to charter special flights four times to make scheduled deliveries into India. While Xiaomi usually relies on commercial cargo flights for deliveries, the company can\\'t always get the space it needs to meet demand, Manu Jain, head of operations in India, told reporters in the New Delhi suburb of Gurgaon yesterday. Hence the charters. The solution for Xiaomi is to produce its smartphones in the countries where it wants to grow. \\xa0Production in India will likely begin in one to two years, and Brazil may start sooner, he said. While Xiaomi has pushed back the expansion plans for some markets, India will be a \"focus\" for years to come, said Barra. The company has sold more than half a million of its low-cost phones in the country since expanding there in July. Xiaomi is on track to cross one million smartphone shipments in India this quarter and could break into the nation\\'s top-five smartphone vendor rankings, he said. \"Like Chinese consumers, Indian consumers are quickly warming up to bigger screens on their devices,\" Shah said. \"Redmi Note will provide that power boost for Xiaomi to quickly move up the rankings capturing market share away from the incumbents.\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDespite concerns over its content, anonymous messaging app Yik Yak secured $62M in funding led by Sequoia Capital, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, according to a person close to the deal. Yik Yak differentiates itself by focusing on local communication; users chat anonymously with one another based on their location. And the company says it is highly popular within schools and universities. \\xa0The app is mostly popular with college students “but has been troublesome for middle and high schools across the country because of bullying,” reports Re/Code. Yik Yak allows anyone within a mile of the person posting the message to read it, which means it works well in school and campus settings, depending on your definition of “working well.” The Wall Street Journal’s Dennis Berman points out that when you log into Yik Yak, these are the “top messages” you see — the ones with the most upvotes by users (using a similar system as Reddit does; being able to vote on posts to get them in front of more eyes.) \\xa0The messages are pretty gross.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook is giving select brands exclusive access to qualitative user insights based on information gleaned from its 1.3 billion users, letting high-rolling advertisers find out what consumers really think based on comments and other telling social activities, according to industry insiders familiar with the special program. The brands and their marketing teams get to dive deeper into Facebook and its unprecedented ability to gauge public sentiment thanks to the marketing program called Grapevine, according to sources. Which brands get invited to the program depends on their bankroll, one industry source said. \"The advertisers spending in the millions on campaigns or a half-million dollars for one ad, that\\'s who has access,\" this person said. Industry insiders said data analysis from Grapevine was \"qualitative not just quantitative.\" For instance, a shampoo brand could get insights into what Facebook users are saying about frizzy hair and then tailor ads based on that sentiment. \\xa0The tool is similar to what Twitter does with its \"firehose\" of tweets, sifting through the torrent of information to track public sentiment. Twitter bought Gnip earlier this year to get a better handle on that data for marketers, and it licenses access to the full stream of information to a select few firms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn-store location targeting is going mainstream this US Holiday Season: Beginning this week, shoppers at Tysons Corner Center with the right app may see a welcome message pop up on their smartphones as they walk into the mall. An hour into their shopping spree, they are likely to receive another text message, this time asking if they’d like their purchases delivered to their home. And if they have questions along the way — does Nordstrom offer gift wrapping or when does California Pizza Kitchen open — they can get instant answers via text messaging. The property is one of a handful of shopping centers around the country experimenting with mobile apps and Bluetooth technology to communicate with customers as they move through the mall. Ugg this month opened its first high-tech store at the Tysons Galleria, where it uses the same wireless sensors that are in E-Z Passes to help shoppers customize boots and find related products on large in-store touch screens. At Burberry’s new outpost at CityCenterDC, which opened in August, company iPads are available for online shopping. And at Inspirato, a luxury vacation company with a new “experience center” at the Tysons Galleria, passersby can use a number of on-site computers and touch screens to browse lodges in Jackson Hole, Wyo., or chateaus in Bordeaux, France.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch out Facebook - Apple is finally showing serious intent about mobile advertising: Its iAd business has gone through several iterations and struggled, and the company is now tapping the ad tech community to open the service widely so marketers can get access to its iPhones, iPads and computers. AdRoll CMO Adam Berke said the new iAd system is going to reshape the mobile advertising landscape, opening access to consumer data Apple had walled off for a long time. Here\\'s how: Berke expects the new iAd to reach massive numbers of users quickly. Apple is using standard format ads to make it easy—mobile banners and video already in use across the industry. App-install ads will immediately be in demand and give mobile developers a new edge in the App Store, which can be a tough environment because of the sheer volume of apps. Apple iTunes and App Store consumer data will finally be open for use to target ads. This is tremendous information about which apps every user has downloaded and which media each one consumes. This knowledge has been locked away within Apple, untouched by marketers until now. \"They have App Store behavioral data, and we\\'ll be able to target based on the types of apps that people like,\" Berke said. The ads will show up in apps that use iAds, and the App Store has hundreds of millions of them, opening up never-before used ad space. \"Any app developer using iAd will suddenly have a lot more demand and a lot more advertisers buying their inventory,\" Berke said. Apple Pay, the new payment service, will feed into the advertising. This is the final piece of information marketers need to know for certain if their ads worked—did the user buy their product? This purchasing behavior is something only Apple will have access to through its control of its mobile ecosystem. \"It [could eventually] allow us to track from the mobile ad impression to the App Store behavior of the user to the app install to eventually someone buying with Apple Pay,\" Berke said.\\n\\n\\nAfter Disney and Activision, now Nintendo launches physical toys that can interact with digital games via NFC: Toy companies had been trying for years to bridge the gap between physical and digital toys, applying different strategies but finding limited success. Like recent physical-virtual crossover hits from Disney and Activision, Nintendo figurines use the technology known as near-field communication to send signals to a device connected to the game console. For Disney and Activision, the toys are required to play the related games. Starter kits are about $75, and figures start at about $13. The Nintendo toys are not required to play the related games, but instead offer bonus features. Each character is $13. Activision’s approach has been to add new features and types of toys to each installment. This fall, the company released Skylanders Trap Team, in which players can insert a physical crystal-shaped item in a base to trap virtual villains.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Social Media Bots Offer Phony Friends and Real Profit\": Numerous reports have found that celebrities, politicians and companies often buy fake followers to enhance their perceived importance online. The practice is so widespread that StatusPeople, a social media management company in London, has a web tool called the Fake Follower Check that it says can tell how many fake followers a person has. According to that tool, 6 percent of Ms. Kardashian’s followers are fake, as are 12 percent of Mr. Sheen’s. Here’s how the pyramid works: With minimal effort, I downloaded a piece of software called Twitter Supremacy. For $50 for a six-month license, the software (which violates Twitter’s terms of service agreement) lets me fabricate an unlimited number of friends. Furthermore, I can program these fake accounts to tweet, retweet and follow others automatically, as if they were living, breathing users. (There are dozens of similar services that do this for Instagram, Vine, Twitter, Tumblr, YouTube and Facebook.) With an army of fake friends at my disposal, I can now charge people who want to increase their number of followers or promote certain tweets. One bot creator I talked to (who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because his work violates user agreements with social media sites) said that he manages hundreds of thousands of Instagram bots and makes a good living by pushing posts to the app’s popular page. He can also manufacture all kinds of engagement, including following accounts and commenting on photos. Who pays for these services? The bot creator said that his clients include well-known celebrities and brands, along with everyday people who want a social media ego boost. (The bot maker wouldn’t let me share whom he works with, but the list includes A-list celebrities and a fast-food chain.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Cable & Wireless helped Britain spy on the world: Channel 4\": Telecommunications firm Cable & Wireless helped Britain eavesdrop on millions of Internet users worldwide, Channel 4 reported on Thursday, citing previously secret documents leaked by a fugitive former U.S. National Security Agency contractor. Cable & Wireless, which was bought by Vodafone in 2012, provided British spies with traffic from rival foreign communications companies, Britain\\'s Channel 4 television said, citing documents stolen by Edward Snowden. Channel 4 said Cable & Wireless gave Britain\\'s GCHQ eavesdropping agency access by renting space on one of the arteries of global communications, a cable that runs to the southern English region of Cornwall. The Channel 4 report, which was impossible to immediately verify given the secrecy of the surveillance programs, said Cable & Wireless carried out surveillance on Internet traffic through its networks on behalf of British spies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon\\'s typical data centers have 50K-80K servers, and there are 28 such data centers globally: Amazon has 11 cloud regions across the world, said James Hamilton, an Amazon distinguished engineer, during a presentation at re:Invent. Each region has multiple sets of data centers, and there are 28 total sets across the world. Each of those has one or more data centers, with a typical facility containing 50,000 to 80,000 servers. A conservative estimate puts Amazon over 1.5 million servers globally. Lydia Leong, an analyst at research firm Gartner, puts it at 2 million or more. By comparison, Rackspace Hosting has a little over 100,000 servers spread across six data centers. Google has three regions with eight total sets, and Microsoft has 17 regions. Last year, Steve Ballmer, then Microsoft\\'s CEO, said the company had over a million servers within its data center infrastructure and that Google had even more. Amazon\\'s cloud could soon get even bigger. Hamilton told me that he saw no reason why Amazon couldn\\'t eventually have a data center in every U.S. state if companies adopt cloud computing as enthusiastically as people predict.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia Post to launch real-time parcel tracking, shipped 85K units for Amazon in October : India Post, which has the biggest network and serves the last mile, is boosting its infrastructure for real-time tracking of parcels through satellites using a new technology. The Postal Department will also soon start an SMS facility to inform customers about delivery status of their parcels. India Post, which is already in tie-ups with e-commerce majors Amazon and Snapdeal, will also have security gadgets like CCTV and access control systems to ensure safety of articles. Amazon started booking parcels at one place with India Post in 2013 which has now expanded to five locations by October 2014. “Amazon shipped 7,000 parcels in January this year. By October, the number of article booked in a month by Amazon increased to about 85,000. Snapdeal sends 2000-3000 parcels per day. Naaptol is giving about Rs 25 crore business to India Post per annum,” the official said. India Post is offering cash collection on delivery facility of product to 200 customers. “Since December 2013 approximately India Post has collected Rs 280 crore as cash on delivery amount and paid to the e-commerce companies,” the official said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba will sell its first-ever $8B bond offering on Thursday, attractively low yields of 110bp over Treasuries for the five-year tranche: It is looking to sell up to seven tranches, including five fixed-rate bonds ranging from three to 20-year maturities and two floating-rate notes with three and five-year maturities, which bankers and investors expect to be the most sought after of the year. \"Alibaba will have no problem attracting the attention of every investor base around the world,\" said one bond syndicate manager. \"They\\'ve done a good job of coming out with enough spread over what would be fair value to make sure they get the size done.\" Alibaba, highly rated for a Chinese corporate at A1/A+/A+, has been sounding out investors this week in Asia, Europe and the US and is believed to have a huge order book already in place before officially starting the marketing phase in Asia overnight. Two market sources said initial indications of interest were at US$10bn. Alibaba\\'s high Single A ratings will help as the company pitches itself as a comparable to blue-chip names like Oracle, Amazon and Cisco, rather than its lower-rated Chinese internet peers Tencent Holdings and Baidu.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAsian shoppers lead the world in \\'showrooming\\': Implication: location-based targeting which is red-hot in the US (news here and here) could be even hotter here: Asia’s shoppers are experts at “showrooming” – the phenomenon of looking at items at a brick-and-mortar store whilst simultaneously checking the prices available online. According to data from Google’s Consumer Barometer survey (shown in a new post on Google’s APAC blog), this showrooming is most prevalent in less developed tech markets, where you might expect it the least. The top showroomers are Vietnam’s shoppers. 40 percent of them stand in a store whilst cross-checking the prices online. South Korea is second. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWalmart Amends Price Matching Policy After Cheap PS4 Debacle, excludes marketplace vendors, third-party sellers, membership or auction sites: Yesterday, some individuals figured out that they could print out an $89.99 Amazon marketplace listing for a brand new PS4 and get the company to sell them the console for the bargain price, considering that it usually retails for $399.99. Price matching guarantees are a common marketing tactic, but Walmart\\'s policy was especially lax, extending to any legitimate retailer including third-party companies. \\xa0The retailer said Wednesday that it is limiting its generous Walmart Ad Match Guarantee to just selected retailers, none of which include marketplace vendors, third-party sellers, membership sites or auction sites. \\xa0Walmart will continue to match the lowest price on Walmart.com and 30 selected retailers, including Amazon.com. However, for an Amazon product to qualify, it must be sold and fulfilled by the online retailer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA button for faster payment collection on e-commerce sites: PayUMoney (earlier PayUPaisa) has introduced a ‘Pay with PayUMoney’ button to let online shoppers complete purchases with just a few clicks. The new feature will basically let e-tailers embed a button within their websites and blogs so that users can make payments without having to navigate away. According to the company, the button’s look and design can be customised as per the website’s design to collect details of customers. Its design also enables the same button to work for both web and mobile. PayU India further claims that over 2,188 merchants have already created the button for collecting payments. E-tailers who want to add the PayUMoney button on their sites / blogs can do so by logging in to PayUMoney and in the merchant dashboard going to PayUMoney tools. Post that, they can click on the PayUMoney button in order to create new button. The e-tailers can then specify the amount and customise the look and feel of the button. They can also add a custom field to collect more information about the customer. Once that is done, e-tailers can embed the button into their website and start collecting payments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba extends Taobao and Alipay to Australian merchants seeking to sell in China; focus on food & agri: Alibaba announced today that China’s biggest online payment system and online marketplace officially launched their respective channels for Australian merchants to sell their goods to Chinese customers. Taobao’s Australian channel will focus on selling food and agricultural imports. “With increasing concerns for food safety and higher levels of disposable income, Chinese consumers are keen on purchasing healthy, safe food and beverages from overseas,” says the press release. These products will be sourced by Melbourne-based Zoyu Digital. The ecommerce titan explains Alipay Australia will work with a joint venture partner called Paybang “to continue serving local businesses targeting China’s booming consumer base and facilitating cross-border trade between the two countries.” Despite media reports to the contrary, Alibaba did not mention launching a localized version of Taobao or Alipay for Australian consumers to shop on. However, Alibaba says it will work with Australia Post to sell Alipay Purchase Cards at 4,400 retail outlets so Aussie shoppers can buy stuff on Tmall and Taobao.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWalmart has been quietly building up its own ad network and apps for comparison shopping: Walmart Exchange WMX is a platform available to brands that sell products at Walmart. Agencies buying ads for Walmart’s brands can use the tool to serve online ads in real-time based on shopper data, promising SKU-level measurement for marketers. Walmart’s media agency MediaVest also has access to WMX to manage its digital media buys on behalf of the retailer. Since launching, Monahan said that WMX is rolling out new features weekly that track the performance of campaigns. Meanwhile, @WalmartLabs is credited for cranking out mobile apps, e-commerce and social tools for shoppers. Just this year, it has rolled out a new e-commerce site, an app revamp that pulls in local inventory and a program called Savings Catcher. Savings Catcher is an app that scans a receipt to find prices at competing stores. If the app finds a cheaper price, shoppers get money back in the form of a gift card.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZomato closed $60M in funding; post-money valuation of $660 million: Zomato, the restaurant search and discovery service, has closed a further $60 million in funding, giving the company a post-money valuation of $660 million. Investment comes from India’s Vy Capital, and existing backers Info Edge, and Sequoia Capital. It takes total funding to over $113 million.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber has walked into a storm of adverse publicity: An article from BuzzFeed this week alleged that an Uber executive floated the idea of hiring opposition researchers to dig up information on particularly critical journalists. But it needn’t have gone to such great lengths to get dirt -- its vast data stores might already contain that sort of insight. In fact, Buzzfeed also alleged that the general manager of Ubers New York City operations tapped into the user profile of one of its reporters, without the reporter’s permission, “to make points in the course of a discussion of Uber policies.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5 early stage Indian startups that were picked by TLabs (an accelerator and early stage seed-fund) 1.

That could prove very lucrative for the ephemeral messaging service. To use the feature for sending friends money that launched today, users connect their debit card to their Snapchat accounts through a partnership with Square Cash. The real names, addresses, and account information associated with those debit cards could potentially be cross-referenced with databases of personal information to give Snapchat a much better idea of who users are and what ads they might want to see.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRocket Internet in Asia: Jabong H1 GMV $81M (195% Y/Y), Lazada H1 GMV $91M (202% Y/Y): Rocket Internet’s first earnings report since its October IPO on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange revealed: Jabong H1 GMV up 195% Y/Y to US$81 million; \\xa0Orders grew 171% to 3.2 million, no data for active users.

Rocket Internet explains that Lazada is shifting from a direct sales model (shipping from its own warehouses) to a marketplace model for third-party merchants. As a result, revenue may suffer. But for now, revenues are stronger than last year, with H1 2014 already amounting to EUR 47.3 million (US$59.2 million), which is 83% of the total 2013 net revenues. EBITDA was negative EUR 40 million (US$50 million). Zalora, which sells clothing in 10 Asian nations: H1 GMV US$70.1 million (44% Y/Y), 1.5 million orders, 1.2 million active users during H1.

Under the partnership, Snapdeal.com is trying to expand its access to consumers in the hinterland with an assortment of over 1000 products through assisted kiosks which would be operated by FINO Paytech. This would enable the target segment to shop online. Apart from Dharavi, Varanasi, Valsad (Gujarat), urban villages of Noida, Gurgaon, Hyderabad and Jaipur are the targets of the e-commerce player to begin with. The company has already started the pilot project in these places. The products would be on display at the digital kiosks curated on an exclusive page requiring login by FINO agent, who would place an order, collect payment, receive and deliver to people who have no permanent address. “Together we aim to provide innovative, yet simple ways to reach and service those end-consumers who are still not exposed to the benefits of online shopping,” Kunal Bahl, co-founder and CEO Snapdeal.com said in a statement. FINO will assist in sales, payments and delivery of ordered products to customers through its network, he added.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle Glass seems to have lost its mojo: Many developers and early Glass users are losing interest in the much-hyped, $1,500 test version of the product: a camera, processor and stamp-sized computer screen mounted to the edge of eyeglass frames. Google Inc itself has pushed back the Glass roll out to the mass market. While Glass may find some specialized, even lucrative, uses in the workplace, its prospects of becoming a consumer hit in the near future are slim, many developers say. Of 16 Glass app makers contacted by Reuters, nine said that they had stopped work on their projects or abandoned them, mostly because of the lack of customers or limitations of the device. Three more have switched to developing for business, leaving behind consumer projects. Google Glass now sells on eBay for as little as half list price.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, Apple marches on inexorably - (i) links to UnionPay, China\\'s largest bankcard network; (ii) Apple Pay is flirting with AliPay, and (iii) is gaining unprecedented traction in the US: App Store customers in China can now link their UnionPay debit or credit cards to their Apple IDs for purchases, Apple announced today. This is significant for Apple and Chinese consumers because China UnionPay, a bankcard network approved by China’s State Council and the People’s Bank of China, enjoys a virtual monopoly. It has issued more than 4.5 billion cards in China, and is available in all cities, as well as in overseas market. China (which has an estimated 100 million iPhone users) is Apple’s most important growth market; in its recent fourth-quarter earnings report, the company reported that the market generated $29.8 billion, or 16 percent, in net sales in 2014.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBehavior-tracking app ClassDojo is going mainstream in the US - and attracting critics: ClassDojo is used by at least one teacher in roughly one out of three schools in the United States, according to its developer. The app is among the innovations to emerge from the estimated $7.9 billion education software market aimed at students from prekindergarten through high school. Although there are similar behavior-tracking programs, they are not as popular as ClassDojo. Many teachers say the app helps them automate the task of recording classroom conduct, as well as allowing them to communicate directly with parents. But some parents, teachers and privacy law scholars say that the carrot-and-stick method of classroom discipline is outmoded, and that behavior apps themselves are too subjective, enabling teachers to reward or penalize students for amorphous acts like “disrespect.” They contend that behavior databases could potentially harm students’ reputations by unfairly saddling some with “a problem child” label that could stick with them for years.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

Uber has been sweating in India ever since local taxi services complained to the RBI that Uber was violating Indian foreign exchange regulations by routing credit card payments from customers to Netherlands-based Uber BV. Most of it was converted back to Indian currency when payments were routed to cab drivers’ accounts in India, after adjusting for commissions, promotions, etc. But the RBI agreed with local competitors like Meru that such transactions violated rules meant to prevent fraud or flight of capital from the country, and that foreign players could not be allowed to bypass a two-stage credit card authentication process required for digital payments in India. Uber was initially given until October 31 to fall in line with these requirements, but the deadline was extended to the end of November. Now Uber has added Paytm’s digital wallet to its payment options. India is the first country where it has made such an arrangement. Those who have already registered with Paytm can just link their accounts with Uber. Others will need to sign up with Paytm which involves regulatory steps like verification of a phone number and email address.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe launch of WeChat\\'s free VOIP calling app was marred by problems; Tencent apologized, attributing the crashes to excessive demand: The folks behind China’s new WeChat Phonebook were left apologizing on Thursday after its Wednesday launch was marred by severe technical problems. WeChat Phonebook has garnered a lot of interest in China as a way to make your phone smarter and cheaper. The app offers free VOIP calling (as long as you’re on wifi) and a variety of convenient services like automatic contact list backup, syncing WeChat avatar images with your contact list, easy group texting, etc. The 1.0 version of the app hit China’s Android and iOS app stores yesterday, and while it immediately shot to the top of the charts, it hasn’t actually been working for many users. Users have reported being unable to register, log in, recieve confirmation text messages, and make phone calls, among other problems. Since making phone calls is the app’s main purpose, that’s kind of a big deal. On Thursday, WeChat apologized via the app’s official Weibo account for the issues. The cause, it says, is that the app had too many users, leading to service instability.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba plans to raise $8 billion in a U.S. bond sale, just two months after its IPO: Asia’s largest Internet company is working to issue its first-ever U.S. dollar-denominated notes to refinance its credit facilities, according to a statement today. The bonds have been rated A+, or the fifth highest investment-grade rating, by Standard & Poor’s and an equivalent A1 by Moody’s Investors Service. The debt issue would be on top of the $25 billion that it collected in a September initial stock offering, which was the biggest share sale on record. The Hangzhou, China-based e-commerce company, with a market capitalization of almost $300 billion, has $11 billion in loans and credit lines, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“They’re pretty flush with capital. It’s another example of companies being opportunistic and trying to take advantage of low rates while they can.” The company will be able to maintain a conservative capital structure with a strong net cash position in the next few years, while it keeps its ratio of debt to cash flow below 1.5 times, according to Fitch. A $4 billion term loan that the company obtained last year pays 2.75 percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate. Libor, the rate at which banks say they can borrow from each other, is at about 0.23 percentage point.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmid flagging investor sentiment, Twitter held its first Analyst Day, and announced a slew of upcoming product changes: the stock rose 7% in response: Loads of coverage: NYT, Bloomberg, Reuters, TechCrunch, AdWeek: (1) An \"instant timeline\" that would allow new users to get value out of the service right away, without having to follow anybody first. Twitter would use algorithms to figure out what might be important and interesting. The feature would also be shown to returning users who don\\'t have \"healthy\" timelines, Chief Executive Officer Dick Costolo said. (2) By early next year, ways for people to \"record, edit and share\" video using the Twitter application. (3) A \"what you missed\" feature to show people the most important tweets that were posted since they last logged in. (4) Starting next week, an update that allows people to share public tweets within private messages. (5) Changes to the Twitter homepage, which draws 125 million people each month who don\\'t log in or sign up. (7) New mobile applications besides Twitter and Vine. (8) Content organized around geography and events. (9) A \"quick promote\" option so that users can turn their tweets into advertisements with a couple of clicks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTencent Q3 results (Q3 rev: $3.2B, 38% Y/Y, operating profit $1.2B, 56% Y/Y) indicate sharply slowing growth on WeChat engagement as well as games monetization: Tencent released its third quarter results for 2014 yesterday and, as analysts predicted, its growth in mobile games has slowed. In fact at RMB 2.6 billion (US$424 million) this quarter’s mobile gaming revenue is actually down compared last quarter, although Tencent blames that mostly on “delayed launches of upgrades.”. Here are a few other highlights from Tencent’s Q3 earnings report: Q3 revenues of RMB 19.8 billion (US$3.2 billion), up 28 percent from same period last year. Operating profit of RMB 7.5 billion (US$1.2 billion), up 56 percent year-on-year. Value-added service revenues saw revenues of RMB 16.5 billion (US$2.6 billion), up 38 percent on Q3 2013. Gaming revenues from WeChat and QQ (the desktop and mobile IM app) reached RMB 2.6 billion (US$423 million), but there’s no breakdown specific just to WeChat’s gaming platform. QQ hit 819.8 million MAUs, up just 0.5 percent year-on-year. WeChat messaging app now has 468.1 million active users (MAUs) in Q3 2014. That’s up from 438 million MAUs in Q2. It represents quarterly growth of 6.8 percent – by far the lowest it has ever seen. WeChat’s growth is nearly half the rate that it saw from Q1 to Q2.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#Amazoncart lets you add products to your Amazon cart by replying on Twitter: The hashtag #AmazonCart was unveiled earlier this year, and according to Dowitcher Designs, it’s currently used in around 5,000 tweets per day.

Only 28 percent of U.S. respondents said the same. Seventy-six percent of Chinese consumers used smartphones while on public transportation, and 49 percent pulled out their phones while in cars. Only 26 percent of Americans used their smartphones on public transport (likely because many buses and trains still lack Wi-Fi) while 64 percent used phones while in cars. \\xa0And 91 percent of China\\'s users play with mobile ads monthly versus 62 percent of U.S. users.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSingle\\'s Day Stats for Alibaba: GMV US$9.3 billion (up 60% Y/Y from last year’s full-day tally of US$5.8 billion). Mobile accounted for 42.6% of GMV (up from 21% last year). Orders: 278.5 million. Top brands: Xiaomi in top spot (Xiaomi sold 720K smartphones in 10 hours), Huawei second, and Haier third. Japan’s Uniqlo was next up in fourth place. Discounts were steep: Merchants were pressured to discount by at least 50%, or to the lowest point in the last 60 days, else face steep drops in listings rank.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCaveat: GMV may have been (heavily) inflated by a \\'Pre-Sales Initiative\\' this year: Alibaba is employing what it calls a \"pre-sale initiative\", under which merchants advertise products at their discounted Singles\\' Day price from as early as Oct. 15. Tmall lets customers put down a deposit for the order but only allows merchants to process the full payment and ship the products on Nov. 11. The company said it had used such a scheme since 2012, since it helps merchants plan the logistics of shipping such large volumes of goods. Merchants said this year it was used much more widely, and was aimed at boosting Alibaba\\'s figures. \"This is a way they can actually count that volume all transacted in one day,\" said one online store manager who asked not to be named in case it damaged his business. \"They\\'ve never done a company-wide policy like this.\" Merchants said Alibaba ensures discounts are genuine by having vendors discount their products from their lowest price within the 60 days before and after Singles\\' Day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLenovo\\'s results were disappointing (Q2 rev: $10.5B, net income $262M), and company said hypergrowth in China smartphone sales is ending: Lenovo’s sales in the quarter were $10.5 billion, compared with the $11.3 billion average of 16 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Second-quarter net income rose 19 percent to $262.1 million, beating the $259.8 million average of 12 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg, as Yang took advantage of Lenovo’s expanding scale to boost profit at more than twice the pace of sales Lenovo fell to third in China, trailing Xiaomi and Samsung, according to researcher Canalys. Smartphone sales in China are projected to hit 426 million units this year, compared with about 214 million two years ago, according to a forecast from International Data Corp. Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) said the era of “hypergrowth” is over in China’s smartphone market after the company reported its slowest sales growth in six quarters. Shares fell to their lowest since June 24 on an intraday basis after Lenovo’s revenue rose 7.2 percent in the three months ended September, the smallest increase since March 2013 and missing analysts’ estimates.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon\\'s AWS business is slowing, facing commoditization and increasing competition from Microsoft and Google:Sales growth at AWS has been declining. AWS is categorized in Amazon’s financial statements in “North America, Other.” That grouping brought in $1.34 billion in the third quarter, up from $960 million a year ago. Yet sales growth fell to 39 percent from a year earlier, down from 57 percent a year before. The cloud industry has become increasingly competitive this year, with Google Inc. and Microsoft slashing costs of their offerings and boosting cloud products. Earlier this month, Google said it was reducing the price of some cloud features -- including storage and networking options -- by 23 percent to 79 percent. Microsoft has also trimmed prices this year and last month said it was increasing cloud services with packages of hardware and software. “Commodification is kind of washing at the foundations of what they do,” said Carl Brooks, an analyst with 451 Group. Amazon remains the dominant cloud provider, with a 27 percent share of the worldwide market for cloud infrastructure services, according to a report last month from Synergy Research Group Inc. Microsoft has around 10 percent, while International Business Machines Corp. has 7 percent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoing cheap rates for website visits in China show why traffic figures from Chinese sites might be unreliable: : A screenshot from a Chinese website that’s selling web traffic: The cheapest option, visits from 1,000 unique IPs per day, will run you just RMB 2.46 (US$0.40) a day. 8,000 visits a day costs just RMB 19.68 (US$3.22). The site in question, which we won’t link to as we don’t wish to contribute to the site’s business, is something that Tech in Asia found easily by searching Baidu, and it claims that it can even help webmasters increase their Alexa ranking.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nToday is Singles Day: updates at Alibaba’s @Alizila Twitter account\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Alibaba sells $2B in the first hour of Singles’ Day, 4 questions analysts are asking: (1) Can Alibaba break US$9 billion in GMV? Last year, Singles Day spenders spent nearly US$6 billion across Alibaba’s marketplaces, Taobao and Tmall. That was nearly double what the sale took in the previous year, and this year Alibaba will be looking for similarly massive growth. (2) Can mobile sales break 50%? Mobile sales accounted for about 36 percent of Alibaba’s overall sales in Q2 of this year, so breaking 50 percent this Singles Day could be a stretch. (3) Will this year’s Singles Day go international? Through programs like Tmall Global, the company has increased the number and profile of international brand names on its ecommerce platforms, and today’s results should reflect how well that’s panned out. For example, Tesla automobiles go on sale on Tmall for the first time today. (4) Will delivery get better and faster? Alibaba has put a great deal of effort into improving the logistical side of its business through projects like its new Cainiao subsidiary and its new partnership with Gooday distribution.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe multi-app strategy \\xa0is paying off and spreading: canonical example Facebook Messenger has 500M users; : Sometimes offering one mobile app just isn’t enough. The thinking goes as such: As companies add features to their main mobile apps, the design and experience can become increasingly cluttered and difficult to navigate. If these companies offer a separate, dedicated app for each feature, perhaps more users will adopt their services. The multi-app strategy is hardly new. Groupon follows in the footsteps of companies like Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare and LinkedIn, among many others. All of these companies have taken sections from their main mobile app offerings and created stand-alone apps for users to download.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAn app to measure kids shoe size is a hit with moms: Stride Rite today is launching an iPad app to grab a chunk of that business, and it lets parents measure their children\\'s feet size so they can then order shoes from the company. It is designed to alleviate a pain point for moms and dads who would rather not head to a store every few months to measure the shoe sizes for kids with constantly growing feet. Kristin Smith, director of e-commerce for the Boston-based retailer, said her brand has seen a 129 percent uptick in mobile traffic and a 200 percent jump in sales during the last 18 months. The app, called Rite Feet and developed by MJD Interactive, will be pushed with digital and social ads, as well as placements via Stride Ride\\'s email list and 300 store locations. \"We\\'ve seen a shift among millennial moms to mobile,\" Smith explained. \"So we are building comprehesive strategy, beginning with the apps. And we are starting to look at iBeacons, though when it comes to mobile payments—we\\'re not quite there yet.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber is seeking to raise an addition $1 billion from new investors, possibly at a $25B valuation, structured as a convertible debt offering: Coverage here, here and here: We’ve heard the company is shopping the deal as a convertible debt offering, as opposed to a typical late-stage equity deal, with a valuation cap of $25 billion. Uber’s existing investors include Benchmark, Menlo Ventures, Google Ventures, TPG Growth, Kleiner Perkins, Fidelity, Wellington Management, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, Jeff Bezos, Lowercase Capital, and First Round Capital, among others. With the financing Uber is seeking to add to that list and is pitching new investors on the deal. For Uber, structuring its financing as convertible debt would reduce its risk of dilution, particularly as the company seeks to raise so soon after its last round. The company is already extremely well-capitalized, having raised approximately $1.6 billion to date. Uber was even tested as a delivery partner for Amazon, and there’s a real possibility it could provide the framework for on-demand delivery of goods from other third-party providers in the future. All that is very capital-intensive, and Uber will need money to make money.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVee, an Indian mobile dating app gets $1M pre-series A funding, even as Momo, a similar Chinese app files for $300M US IPO: Founded in April this year, Vee received $1 million in its pre-Series A. Vee is a dating app that connects people who are single with others having the same tastes. It essentially helps users find out companions around their area and get into mutual relationships. The company claims that Vee can predict one’s approximate location, and based on the algorithms that work on the backend, it recommends people they may like around their area. For instance, when you see a profile on the app, you can like him/her anonymously. The other person will not get to know about it until he/she likes you back. The app connects you with people only when both the users have liked each other. As soon as you are connected, you can start chatting with them using the app. The interesting thing is that women users can choose to make the chats disappear in 30 seconds (so that they don’t have to worry about leaving a trail), and you can connect with multiple persons at a time. A free app, Vee is currently available on Android as well as iOS platforms. With the app, the company is targeting the youth population within the age group of 18-28. “We have seen more than 50,000 downloads across iOS and Android already. Over 23,000 pairs have been created and around 4.4 million messages exchanged on the platform so far,” explained Gupta. The firm is also looking to monetise the app in the near future by introducing a paid subscription model, wherein it will make a customised match to its premium subscribers and will organise meeting events for them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLinkedIn is being sued over Reference Search: The LinkedIn service in question is called “Reference Search.” It is available only to premium account holders, who pay a monthly fee. An employer or recruiter can use it to generate a list of people in its own network who worked at the same company at the same time as a job candidate. It also allows premium members to use the site’s messaging system to contact people who appear on those lists, without notifying a job candidate. In Sweet v. LinkedIn, a class-action suit filed last month in Northern California, the plaintiffs contended that LinkedIn, in providing the job reference material, enabled potential employers to “anonymously dig into the employment history of any LinkedIn member, and make hiring and firing decisions based upon the information they gather,” without ensuring that the information was accurate. This, they said, is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon quietly launched Echo, a voice-controlled smartspeaker with integrated voice-ordering from Amazon: Initial reactions are mixed at best: \\xa0Echo is priced at $199, Amazon said on its website today. Members of Amazon’s Prime fast-shipping program can purchase the gadget for $99 for a limited period. With Echo, Amazon can plant a voice-activated device in homes that lets users easily order things from the Web retailer by adding it to their shopping lists via voice command and later confirming the purchase through a companion app. Yet it’s unclear if consumers will see enough benefits and convenience to embrace another piece of hardware. “It seems like an odd and not-very-useful product,” said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “The consumer doesn’t need yet another device in their home that replicates what they already have on their phone.” Amazon introduced Echo with little fanfare, simply putting up a Web page about the device.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDespite splashy new investments and Alibaba, SoftBank is hurting from its Sprint investment: A 15 percent drop in SoftBank’s shares this year suggests investors have concerns about its shorter-term prospects. The company this week reduced its annual operating profit outlook by 10 percent, citing mounting losses at Sprint. Its 80 percent ownership of Sprint is worth about $15.5 billion, less than the $22 billion SoftBank paid last year. Sprint’s shares have slumped 54 percent in New York this year. After the company reported its 11th straight quarter of subscriber losses this week, the stock fell 21 percent in the last two days alone. In addition to Sprint, and the the 32% stake in Alibaba, SoftBank owns 36% \\xa0of Yahoo Japan Corp. (4689) and 40% of GungHo. Those stakes are worth $8.6 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, according to its website.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLocation-based audience targeting is used by 18% of US mobile retailers (set to double in a year); \\xa0Geo-location could turn help offline retailers fight back against online: In category after category, Amazon has steadily eroded the market share of traditional bricks-and-mortar retail chains, which seem to be in a state of irreversible decline. Much of the online giant’s competitive advantage is based on its access to and mastery of rich customer data. Traditional retailers know relatively little about their customers, unless they have a loyalty card and actually buy something – and even this knowledge comes late, after a purchase is made. They have no way to cross sell, recommend new products, or target advertising. Unlike Amazon, they can’t tell if a potential customer visits the store or passes by it without buying anything. But all that is about to change because traditional retail is starting to wake up to the potential of geolocation, which is giving the new wave of data analytics companies ways to help bricks-and-mortar retailers make up for the data deficit. A separate analysis finds that 18 percent of US mobile marketers plan to use iBeacon technology to target consumers this year. \"We expect that to double next year,\" she said. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon is experimenting with (i) deliveries by taxi in the US, and (ii) tying up with newspaper vendors as pick-up locations at scale in the UK: US Taxi-Delivery Experiment: Amazon.com Inc is testing deliveries via taxis in San Francisco and Los Angeles, according to the Wall Street Journal, as the Internet retailer explores alternative modes of delivery to speed up shipments while restraining cost. Amazon is using the taxi-hailing mobile app, Flywheel, to ship parcels via licensed cabs, studying the feasibility of using taxi fleets more broadly as a delivery avenue, the Journal cited people familiar with the matter as saying. In its latest test, Amazon summoned cabs through Flywheel to distribution centers, from where they picked up as many as 10 packages bound for the same location at about $5 per package, the Journal reported. The deliveries usually took place early in the morning, when taxi traffic was low and the competition unlikely to notice, the paper cited the people as saying. UK Tie-up with news wholesaler for in-store pick-up: In October 2014, Amazon announced a partnership with Smiths News, a leading UK newspaper and magazine wholesaler, to offer customers same-day pickup service via the newsagent’s new subsidiary, Pass My Parcel, which will deliver Amazon packages to its select retail locations. Pickup locations are available in more than 6,000 locations throughout the UK, but same-day service is available for only 500 of them. During online checkout, buyers may see a \"Pickup is Available — Choose from XX Locations Near You” message, which lets them select a delivery and pickup site. With the Pass My Parcel delivery service, the delivery process is expedited through Smiths News’ twice-daily distribution schedule. Orders made by 11:45 a.m. can be available for same-day pickup at 4 p.m., and orders made by 7:45 p.m. can be available for pickup by 6:30 the next morning in these select retail locations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n~5% Audience Engagement: That\\'s what GoPro, Disney have on Instagram: The most successful brands on Instagram get up to 5% audience engagement. GoPro, for instance has 3.3M followers, 163K likes, and 2K comments: the study defines audience engagement as total user actions (likes + comments) as % of follower base. The highest benchmarks were set by advertisers in Consumer Electronics and Travel; Leaders in Retail (Foot Locker) and Fashion (NYX Cosmetics) had engagement of 2.5%; Autos (Mercedes Benz) stood at 2.9%.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter completes one - not very successful - year as a public company tomorrow: Twitter Inc. (TWTR) is celebrating its one-year anniversary as a public company tomorrow with a stock that’s soared 55 percent from its debut. Its performance by many other measures is less stellar. After jumping 73 percent to open at $45.10 on its first trading day, Twitter’s share price today is lower at $40.37, and the company currently has a record-low enterprise value of 19.4 times trailing 12-month sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The San Francisco-based company also continues to bleed money, with losses widening faster than sales gains. Twitter’s profitability has been pushed out to 2017 from 2015 at the time of its initial public offering, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The data underline how Twitter has fallen short as the rocket-ship growth stock it billed itself as during the run-up to last November’s IPO. The microblogging service touted its global reach and potential during its pitch to investors, asking them to focus on monthly user numbers that ended up slowing. Now Chief Executive Officer Dick Costolo is dealing with the backlash, even as the company’s digital-advertising business booms. The disconnect between what people thought would happen with Twitter’s trajectory and what actually happened make this one of the bigger “misfires” in technology stocks, said Francis Gaskins, research director at financial-media site Equities.com. “It’s been a round-trip ticket.” Jim Prosser, a spokesman at Twitter, declined to comment. Twitter went public last Nov. 6 at $26 a share.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAudience-targeting reaches HR; used to predict attrition, budget overspends: Workday, a leading maker of cloud-based software for running corporate human resources and financial operations, has announced it is putting into its products the kind of data analysis that Netflix uses to recommend movies, LinkedIn has to suggest people you might know, or Facebook needs to put a likely ad in front of you. One version of the Workday predicts which high-performing employees are likely to leave a company in the next year; it then offers possible actions (more money, new job) that might make them stay. In another instance, expense reporting software can predict which employee populations are most likely to exceed their budgets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

Specifically, the SAIC is worried about the following abuses, which it has gotten consumer complaints about following previous years’ Singles Day sales: (1) Artificially raising prices so that they can then be lowered to make the normal price look like a great deal (2) Claiming to be out of stock to avoid selling low-priced items to too many customers when stocks are actually sufficient to honor customer orders (3) Changing orders or canceling sales (again, to avoid having to sell too many items at a discount) (4) Advertising using superlatives like “the lowest price on the web” or “lowest price ever”, which are illegal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSmart in-store notifications using location targeting beacons are gaining popularity among offline retailers: Urban Outfitters is loading up 15 stores in Philadelphia, Boston, New York, Atlanta, New Jersey and Delaware with beacons—small devices that marketers place around stores that ping messages at shoppers who have downloaded the retailer\\'s app. Swirl, the platform that powers the beacons, said that two-thirds of consumers shop in-store with a smartphone. And instead of pushing aggressive offers at smartphone-wielding consumers, the beacons plug into the Urban On loyalty program, a section in the app that gives shoppers rewards and access to events. Initially, Urban Outfitters has pinpointed three areas to focus its mobile efforts around: the checkout line, fitting rooms and the entrance. When smartphone-wielding shoppers first enter the store, a push notification prompts users to check-in via social media to unlock an offer. Then in the fitting room, beacons are being used to churn out user-generated content about products. Shoppers are prompted to take selfies and post them to Instagram with the hashtag #UOonYou for a chance to be featured on Urban Outfitters\\' website. Shoppers at the register may get a push notification promoting them to shake their phone to show the Urban ID—a loyalty card—and earn a digital badge.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXiaomi looking to raise funds at $40-50B valuation: Xiaomi Corp. is in talks for a funding round that values the smartphone maker at around $40 billion to $50 billion, people familiar with the matter said. The discussions are at an early stage and nothing is finalized, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. The world’s third-biggest smartphone maker had a financing round in August 2013 that valued the company at $10 billion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCaught off-balance by Holiday season demand surge last year, US retailers (a) boost demand planning (b) hire more (c) push in-store pick-up: Last year hundreds of millions of gifts and bad weather overtaxed United Parcel Service and FedEx, leading to shipping delays and empty space under the tree. Given the expected spike in online sales, the big question will be whether retailers and carriers can plan well enough to avoid the same problems. \\xa0“We started talking to our customers much earlier this year, and we were planning together with them for their volume forecasting,” she said. U.P.S. and FedEx, which typically hire tens of thousands of extra workers around the holiday season, plan to hire even more this year, both companies said. And they are taking other steps, like adding more sorting facilities and technology to help track packages. At the same time, they will also be crossing their fingers to avoid the abysmal weather that delayed shipments last year (FedEx even has 15 full-time meteorologists on staff). But the onus is not just on the carriers. Major retailers like Walmart and Target are also taking steps to make sure that customers get their gifts on time. Target is planning an even bigger marketing push to get customers who order online to pick up their gifts in the store, a feature the company introduced last year, a Target spokesman, Eddie Baeb, said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAudience-Targeted ads embedded in the comments sections of forums: \\xa0Third party comments service Disqus believes it could be sitting on an advertising gold mine. The third-party comments service, which runs the discussion section on 3 million websites, is starting to show data-targeted sponsored comment ads. Disqus has 150 million users signed up for its service, which lets people leave comments across participating websites like CNBC, The Atlantic, ABC News, Rolling Stone and more niche sites like SuperHeroHype. The San Francisco-based company mines comments, comment votes and comment context to target ads, which will now show up looking like part of the discussion.Disqus is working with Xaxis, WPP\\'s automated ad platform, to let brands buy ads against the Disqus comments, which will be shown at the top of the discussion threads and marked sponsored. It will be up to publishers if they want to show the new ads from Disqus, and they could share in the revenue.\"When people come to a page that has Disqus, we know what they’re reading,\" said David Fleck, gm of advertising at the company. \"We know if they choose to comment. We know what they comment on and know what they say in that comment. We know if they voted on it, and shared it out to social networks.\" Disqus said its metadata are used to create anonymous profiles against which brands could target ads, without sharing personally identifiable information. \"We have the largest and deepest audience profiles on the Web,\" Fleck said.Brian Lesser, Xaxis CEO, added, \"It makes native advertising programmatic at scale. We are pushing the envelope of what is possible within the world of programmatic.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFading Monster.com hopes big-data snooping and audience targeting will win its mojo back: Monster.com disrupted the talent business, and then the disrupter was itself disrupted. Competing websites, as well as aggregators that scanned many sites for job listings and put them in one place, began to eat into Monster’s business. LinkedIn was born and became a global behemoth by positioning itself as an upscale matchmaker that helped people build careers, not just find the next job. Today, the company that owns Monster.com, renamed Monster Worldwide, is a shadow of its former self, and its stock trades for less than $4 a share. It still earns substantial revenue, $194.4 million in the second quarter of this year, from its job board and various other services. But now it wants to recapture some of its past luster by offering new cutting-edge tools for employers. Its latest products, both rooted in start-ups acquired by Monster this year, use big-data snooping and social-ad targeting to improve the process of matching job openings and potential applicants. The more developed of the two new tools, called TalentBin, works by building profiles of individual workers. But unlike LinkedIn, it does so without their active participation or consent. Instead, TalentBin scans publicly posted information on social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, Meetup and Twitter, as well as what people have put on industry-specific sites, such as GitHub for software engineers and Dribbble for visual designers, to craft the dossiers. It then allows employers to run their job listings against the database to find people who meet certain criteria, such as “knows a lot about Java programming.” Recruiters can also study the dossiers to craft personalized email pitches to top candidates, citing personal or professional details from their profiles — something like “I loved the shoe designs you posted on Coroflot.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSamsung is acknowledging lost ground to Apple in the high-end market, and will look to re-claim lost ground in China: Samsung has capitulated: It launched two phones last night, the Galaxy A3 and A5, which are both “mid-range” devices with metal bodies. They look a bit like iPhones, but they’ll probably be priced cheaper. It’s the price that is key: Samsung is basically saying it cannot compete against iPhone on high-end prices with top-flight models, so it must compete instead against cheaper low-end Android manufacturers like China’s Xiaomi by offering quality devices at reasonable prices. The Galaxy A3 and A5 are seen by analysts as Samsung\\'s first counter-strike. Initially launching in China in November, they will be Samsung\\'s first devices to feature fully metallic bodies and its thinnest smartphones to date. In size, the A3 and A5 are comparable to those of the top-of-the-line Galaxy S5, though of lesser screen resolution quality. Meanwhile, Sony will retreat from the Chinese smartphone market, where it has had little success.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, a selfie-makeover app with a clear monetization model: Photox (pronounced like Botox) allows users to submit candid photos to a team of editors who will give it a touch up — or overhaul — depending on what changes the subject wants to see made. The edits can range from minor tweaks, such as teeth whitening or eye color correction, to near-surgical changes, including breast and butt enhancements, full-body weight loss and bald spot coverup. Once a user uploads his or her photo to the app, they are presented with more than 30 editing options. Each edit requires a certain number of credits, and each credit costs 99 cents. Removing a tattoo or scar requires one credit, or 99 cents. Erasing the photo’s background runs nine credits, or $8.91. “We have a lot of people using a photo from their family vacation as a LinkedIn headshot and you would never know it was taken at a restaurant or on the beach,” Imperiale said. If you haven’t been hitting the gym lately, Photox can add six-pack abs ($3.96), give you skinny legs ($3.96) or bulk-up your arms ($2.97). If it’s a dermatologist you desire, the app can also minimize wrinkles ($2.97), lighten skin ($3.96) and remove acne (99 cents).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLinkedIn could be an excellent B2B marketing tool, and in fact may already be setting up for a clash with SalesForce: Here’s a hypothetical scenario: What if you included some JavaScript from LinkedIn on your company’s website so that whenever a signed-in LinkedIn user visited your site, you could see who they were in LinkedIn Sales Navigator? Since the overwhelming majority of potential leads just browse and don’t fill in your forms, this would give you insight into a whole new population of potential customers that your Marketo and Salesforce systems can’t track. If LinkedIn offered a more sales or marketing automation-style interface, you could select, group or filter those web visitors and send them educational LinkedIn InMails or purchase targeted advertising on LinkedIn or in their LinkedIn email digests. Marketers and salespeople could eventually use LinkedIn to reach new prospects who haven’t yet visited their sites. LinkedIn would know which types of users find your company interesting – especially if the company worked itself down the funnel towards Salesforce’s territory to offer CRM functions. By knowing the history of your leads (i.e. which ones end up converting to customers), LinkedIn could help you pinpoint your hottest prospects even before they hit one of your landing pages or contact forms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon launches global shipping into China (from Amazon global stores) starting Singles Day: Amazon is planning an interesting move in China that could shift the balance somewhat starting with its Singles Day sale this year: global shipping. To be clear, this doesn’t mean you can buy goods off of Amazon China from anywhere in the world. Rather, it means that Chinese consumers will be able to shop on Amazon’s US, German, Spanish, French, and Italian stores and have whatever they order shipped directly to China. Amazon China is also launching an “international shopping” feature that should make it more convenient for Chinese customers to shop for goods they want from foreign Amazon shops. Moreover, the shipping may not take as long as you’d expect; Amazon China has arranged partnerships with EMS, UPS, and other global shipping companies that should bring international orders to Chinese doorsteps faster than ever. The new partnerships promise to help customers get their orders through customs quickly, and some items may arrive within three days of being ordered. Sure, that’s nothing compared to the speed of shipping within China, but for an international order, three days is very fast.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLinkedIn positive earnings surprise (Q3 revenue $568M, 45% Y/Y, net loss $4.3M) on real momentum in China; no updated user stats: Interestingly, each of the company\\'s three divisions grew at the same rate (~45%). Talent Solutions – otherwise known as the company’s recruitment products and services — continues to be the company’s biggest earner, now accounting for 61% of all revenues. Marketing Solutions – the company’s advertising products — is a steady 19% of revenues. Premium Subscriptions – the paid subscriptions to have access to more LinkedIn features — is 20% of total revenue, same as a year ago. The U.S. is 60 percent of all revenues, at $343 million, and while LinkedIn is pushing harder into markets like China, it’s pulling in $225 million at the moment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGroupon also had a positive earnings report (Q3 revenue $757M, 27% Y/Y, net loss $21M); firm is hanging in there tenaciously with many new products: \\xa0Groupon managed to best expectations, but not by a margin that investors found too compelling. The company is up 1% in after-hours trading. Groupon in the last quarter has been continuing its efforts to build out its product portfolio and continue developing its services in a bid to boost its traffic and offset any declines that it may see in daily deals. That has included the launch of individual business pages to rival those of Yelp, a shopping loyalty and couponing app called Snap, and a more flexible model for how it lets businesses list deals based on specific times of day to improve footfall. It’s slowly making some progress on these fronts. The company says that 100 million people have now downloaded its mobile apps globally.\\n\\n\\nFacebook Audience Targeting could be changing politics just like it is changing the news business: Modern political campaigns home in on their key voters with drone-like precision, down to the smallest niche — like Prius-driving single women in Northern Virginia who care about energy issues. They compile hundreds of pieces of data on individuals, from party registration to pet ownership to favorite TV shows. Some platforms are now tailoring their offerings to meet the campaigns wherever they are. Facebook, for instance, at its most basic level allows campaigns to focus their message on a particular ZIP code or gender, or even a group of voters that “likes” a certain set of Facebook pages — maybe MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow and The Nation, or Fox News’s Sean Hannity and Guns & Ammo magazine. At a more sophisticated level, a campaign can upload its entire voter file to Facebook, and work with one of the site’s data partners to reach only its targets with messages designed specifically for them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLine reported strong results (rev: $192M, 104% Y/Y, income not revealed); 30 million users in India: Unlike rival Whatsapp (600M users), which effectively does not monetize at all (a luxury available to Whatsapp thanks to Facebook\\'s spectacular overall profitability), Line makes its money as a digital content platform — most of its revenue comes from in-app purchases within its connected games platform, which includes more than 50 titles, but it also sells stickers and operates a marketing channel which lets brands run official accounts and pay to reach consumers. Line \\xa0stated that it has 170 million monthly active users worldwide, 87 million of which come from Taiwan, Thailand, and and Japan. The app claims 30 million users in India. By the end of the year it will introduce payments, taxi hailing, and food delivery services, which will accompany new gaming, manga, and music initiatives. Line recently postponed plans to go public in a rumored dual US-Japan IPO that could value it at $10 billion. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXiaomi is now the world’s third largest smartphone maker, while Samsung\\'s mobile division has its worst quarter since 2011: Xiaomi is now the world’s third largest smartphone maker, due in large part to the success of its high-end Mi4, says new research by IDC. This is also the first time that Xiaomi has broken into the research firm’s list of the top 5 smartphone makers in the world. Samsung remains at the lead despite declining shipment volume, followed by Apple, Xiaomi, and Lenovo and LG, which tied for fourth place. Samsung spent most of the quarter without launching a new flagship device, and continued to struggle in the mid-to-low tier markets against cheaper and value-packed offerings like Xiaomi\\'s Redmi 1S. Profit for the mobile division fell 73.9 percent to 1.75 trillion won in the third quarter, its worst performance since the second quarter of 2011.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDating/hook-up app Tinder has staggering engagement levels, based on a simple psychological truth: looks matter: In the two years since Tinder was released, the smartphone app has exploded, processing more than a billion swipes left and right each day (right means you “like” someone, left means you don’t) and matching more than 12 million people in that same time, the company said. Tinder’s engagement is staggering. The company said that, on average, people log into the app 11 times a day. Women spend as much as 8.5 minutes swiping left and right during a single session; men spend 7.2 minutes. All of this can add up to 90 minutes each day. While conventional online dating sites have been around longer, they haven’t come close to the popularity of Tinder.\\n\\n\\nReddit launches a crowd-funding site as it attempts to monetize non-intrusively: Reddit, where users find, share and talk about web links and photos, has been faithful to an antiquated design and still looks like an online message board plucked from the 1990s — think Craigslist, but with more Lolcats. You don’t need to hand over any personal data, not even an email address, to sign up and post or view an item. The huge online community message board site unveiled Redditmade on Wednesday, a crowdfunding initiative that allows Reddit users to raise money to manufacture and sell customized items. The move will add another revenue stream to Reddit, which has tried to find creative ways to make money from the millions of people who visit the site without angering its quirky community of Internet denizens. Reddit has grown enormously in popularity over the last five years but only recently started focusing more on making money. Reddit now makes money from a small e-commerce site, Reddit Gifts. It also sells Reddit Gold, a subscription program that offers perks for signing up. Its largest moneymaker by far, however, is advertising.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook\\'s shares fell 10% on forecasts of higher spending, lower growth, despite beating earnings expectations (Q3 rev: $3.2B, Y/Y 59%, net income $806M, Y/Y 90%). The firm forecast revenue growth of 40% to 47% in Q4 2014, down sharply from 59% in Q3. CFO Dave Wehner also warned that the social network is preparing for a 55% to 75% spike in expenses next year, when the world\\'s largest social network intends to invest in Whatsapp, Oculus and other products that have yet to show a profit. Facebook declined to provide any estimates for its expected pace of revenue growth in 2015, adding to investor worries. \"Giving expense guidance without giving revenue guidance is frustrating and spooking The Street,\" said BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield. \"The multi-billion dollar question is what’s revenue growth going to look like next year,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Facebook stock has risen, the cost of the Whatsapp acquisition has risen too: from $16B ($4B in cash, $12B in FB stock) originally to $21.8B: For this, Facebook offered $4 billion in cash and $12 billion in stock, with the company’s founders eligible for an additional $3 billion in restricted stock. But as Facebook’s own stock has continued to rise, so has the value of the deal. The final tally came in at $21.8 billion, as the Deal Professor noted this month. WhatsApp reported a meager $10.2 million in revenue last year, but has 600M users. Mark Zuckerberg spoke about how he wanted to take the mobile messaging app quickly to a billion users from 600 million. (“For us, products really don’t get that interesting to turn into businesses until they have about one billion people using them,” he said.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook engagement ticked up; but the firm sidestepped Snapchat-inspired questions on teen engagement: Facebook, already the world’s largest social network, said it had 1.35 billion monthly users in September, up from 1.32 billion in June, and 64 percent of them used the service daily, up slightly from the second quarter. The firm however did not field the one question that could have instilled confidence…or sent it into a death spiral: teen engagement. The company refused to break out any data about usage levels of teens, which are widely thought to be abandoning Facebook for apps like Snapchat. When asked about engagement for different demographics, Facebook’s CFO David Wehner said the company had nothing to report on specific cohorts of users. That was probably smart. A year ago when ex-CFO David Ebersman said Facebook “did see a decrease in daily users specifically among younger teens,” the share price plummeted despite an otherwise killer quarter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile Renren (in 2011 touted as the Facebook of China) serves as a cautionary reminder that valuations can be fleeting: \\xa0Renren Inc. (RENN) was touted the Facebook Inc. of China when it debuted in New York in 2011. Today it’s looking more like online flameout Myspace. The stock has lost more than three quarters of its value since 2011. “When Renren appeared, students like me added as many friends as possible, but you get tired scrolling through horoscopes and advertisements searching for original content, because WeChat looked like a more enticing platform for posting news and reading comments,” Hou said by phone on Oct. 21. “It was the same with Myspace: you log in, you scroll through your newsfeed -- to find out that all the interesting conversations are happening on Facebook.” Three years after the IPO, the networking website’s valuation has fallen to less than eight times sales. The 24-year-old still checks her Renren account about three times a week, though for WeChat “it’s every hour,” she said. Monthly unique users decreased to about 44 million as of June, Renren said in a statement in August. That compares with more than 438 million monthly active users for WeChat and 157 million users for Weibo, a Twitter-like microblogging service controlled by Sina Corp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon\\'s non-US eCommerce business (EGM-only, not media) constitutes ~20% of total revenue and grew about 19% Y/Y in Q3: That\\'s one of many interesting insights in a deep-dive by a well-known Amazon blogger. Amazon\\'s geographical mix for the Q was 63% North America (growth 25% Y/Y), 37% non-domestic (13% Y/Y). \\xa0Amazon\\'s 1P and 3P businesses are doing quite well and the problems are in media (25% of total revenue, which grew only 4%) and \\xa0non-seller oriented areas such as the Fire phone which had a \\xa0$170m write-down for the Q and Amazon is sitting on $83m in inventory. On a 2x2 of (EGM v Media) and (US v International), US EGM was the largest (~50%) and the fastest growing segment (31% Y/Y): every other segment is growing below the average. Amazon reported $20.6B in Q3 revenue, at 20% growth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter earnings (Q3 rev: $361M, 114% Y/Y, net loss $175M) beat estimates, but the stock was still down 10% on engagement worries and lack of product innovation: Twitter is doing a great job monetizing (especially on mobile:85% of revenue from mobile), but engagement is stagnating: not enough new users (monthly active users rose only 23% to 284 million in the quarter) and decreasing engagement per user (timeline views per user slid 7% globally to 636). “The lack of growth there comes from Twitter’s relative lack of innovation,” said Nate Elliott, an analyst at Forrester who studies social media. “The experience on Twitter today is the same experience people have always had on Twitter.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAliPay and Apple Pay might join forces: Jack Ma and Tim Cook both repeatedly teased a possible partnership between The Paypal-like AliPay and Apple Pay in two separate talks while on stage at the Wall Street Journal Digital conference in Laguna Beach, California this evening. An Apple Pay/AliPay partnership is certainly intriguing. Apple Pay activated over 1 million credit cards within the first 72 hours of going live with the service, making it a strong contender in the digital payment space. AliPay dominates in online payments for a good chunk of the rest of the world and, as Ma pointed out on stage, “Alipay is now the third largest payment system in the world, behind Visa and Mastercard.”. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSeparately, Alibaba\\'s mutual fund has shrunk a bit - from $92B to $87B as big Chinese state-owned banks respond to competition: Alibaba’s mutual fund Yuebao garnered a lot of attention when it first launched last summer, and at first, it grew extremely fast. But by this July, it had begun to stagnate, and now according to the latest numbers, investment in Yuebao is actually dropping. Its still huge though: at $87B down from $92B Yuebao has been limited by government restrictions that emerged around March, which made it harder for customers to shift funds to online rivals, imposed transfer limits, banned new types of payments such as QR codes, and halted the launch of virtual credit cards. Alibaba chairman Jack Ma publicly slammed the central bank and big four for abusing their ‘monopoly’.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

Roughly once a week, Facebook adjusts the complex computer code that decides what to show a user when he or she first logs on to Facebook. The code is based on “thousands and thousands” of metrics, Mr. Marra said, including what device a user is on, how many comments or likes a story has received and how long readers spend on an article. The goal is to identify what users most enjoy, and its results vary around the world. In India, he said, people tend to share what the company calls the ABCDs: astrology, Bollywood, cricket and divinity.

The web giant made a fresh US$20 million series A investment into Blink, a new photo sharing and messaging app out of China. Sequoia Capital, H Capital, ZhenFund, and Innovation Works also participated in the round, according to Techweb.Tencent became king of China’s online social messaging sphere with the mass adoption of QQ Messenger and kept the throne when it unleashed WeChat. But even though QQ earlier this year boasted a record 200 million concurrent users and WeChat’s growth is only now starting to show signs of saturation, the web giant is actively looking for the next big thing for young people who no longer think WeChat is cool.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJust Dial plans slew of new products, announces Q3 earnings: Rev INR 147 Crore (30.8% Y/Y) Net Profit INR 32 Crore (9% Y/Y): Revenues growth was driven by a strong 24.1% rise in paid campaigns and 5.5% increase in revenue per campaign (after a recent price rise), over the year-ago quarter. Listings increased 44 % year-on-year (y-o-y), to 14.5 million.The company\\'s product Search Plus offers 20 live services currently and has not been monetised so far. The firm plans to launch many new products such as ‘Just Dial Cash’, On-line cab booking, ‘Just Dial Guaranteed’, amongst others, which will start contributing to revenues from FY16. The firm hopes these will help it improve monetization and to translate its strength in voice to online.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon\\'s very weak earnings (rev $20.8B, 20% Y/Y, net loss $544M) and slowing growth outlook (Q4 at 7% to 18% Y/Y) triggered a sell-off; also the company took out a $2B line of credit to meet working capital requirements recently: Amazon reported lower than expected revenue in its third quarter, and a larger than expected loss. Analysts expected the company to lose $0.74 on revenue of $20.84 billion. Instead, Amazon lost $0.95 per share on revenue of $20.58 billion. Shares were down 10% after-hours. Investors were particularly spooked that forecasts for Q4 were weak too - “I think that the potential for a loss in the fourth quarter is what is freaking people out,” one analyst said. Last month the company revealed it had taken out a $2 billion line of credit with Bank of America for “working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate purposes.” Revenue growth - long Amazon\\'s stated objective - could slow sharply next quarter. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft\\'s Q3 earnings (rev $23B, 25% Y/Y, net income $4.5B) were everything that Amazon\\'s were not: Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue, helped by stronger sales of its phones, Surface tablets and cloud-computing products for companies, while keeping its profit margins largely intact. The results on Thursday allayed fears of investors in recent days that the industry shift toward lower-margin cloud services was proving hard for established technology leaders to master. Microsoft shares, which have climbed 33 percent over the past year, rose another 3 percent in after-hours trading to $46.36. the company said its net income was $4.54 billion, or 54 cents a share, compared with $5.24 billion, or 62 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue was $23.20 billion, up from $18.53 billion\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTencent seeks to marry messaging and eCommerce and out-flank Alibaba - invests in a mobile shopping portal that integrates with WeChat: Koudai Gouwu, a Chinese mobile shopping portal, today announced a huge US$350 million series C funding round led by Tencent and Tiger Fund, followed by H Capital, Vy Capital, Falcon Edge, and DST, according to the company’s official Weibo account (h/t TechNode). Of the total amount, Tencent pitched in US$145 million for a 10 percent stake in the company. On the surface, Koudai is a typical Chinese marketplace with a nice looking mobile website and app with an emphasis on fashion products, but it also has a few tricks up its sleeve. The biggest is that users can browse and make purchases from shops within WeChat. Small vendors can use the site to set up their own shops and market them through Koudai’s WeChat channels. That’s a huge opportunity for merchants looking to capitalize on WeChat’s 438 million monthly active users. Rumors on Chinese media suggested the three-year-old startup received even more traffic than Taobao on mobile, and Alibaba founder Jack Ma himself approached Koudai’s would-be investors to discourage them. Koudai could be a powerful ally for Tencent, which makes WeChat, in its face off against Alibaba’s Taobao and Tmall marketplaces.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXiaomi is moving user data out of China - possibly in response to security concerns, including some from the Indian Air Force: User data for those based outside of China is being moved to servers operated by Amazon.com in California and Singapore, Xiaomi Vice President Hugo Barra wrote today on his Google+ page. All shopping data for international users is expected to be moved out of Beijing by the end of the month, while profiles, text messages and other services should be completed by the end of the year, Barra wrote. In August, security firm F-Secure alleged that Xiaomi\\'s devices were collecting and transmitting personal data to Beijing. The Indian Air Force made similar accusations, according to a report from the New Indian Express newspaper. Apart from privacy, Barra also said the moving data to overseas servers has significantly boosted speed in markets such as Singapore, India and Malaysia. Xiaomi is targeting India and Brazil as its next big markets. This, while Apple CEO Tim Cook met with Chinese Vice Premier Ma Kai to discuss protecting user data two days after a report that (possibly Chinese-backed) hackers targeted its iCloud services.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOffline Retailers should use smart programmatic strategies to make in-store purchases more competive to \\xa0\\'showroomers\\' \\xa0consumers visit stores to see products in person, only to turn around and purchase those products at better prices online from other sellers.

In our series this week, we learned that the social platform\\'s millennial-leaning user base has grown 33 percent since Mayer and her team purchased it for $1.1 billion. This revenue is achieved via four main ad products:\\n\\n\\n\\nSponsored Posts: Tumblr charges a cost-per-engagement (CPE) rate for Sponsored Posts, an offering for Web and mobile marketers that includes Yahoo.com properties in addition to Tumblr\\'s.

The press (NYT here, Washington Post here) has been agog with reports that Chinese authorities have been involved in a sophisticated cyber-attack on Apple. A sophisticated cyber-attack has targeted Apple’s iCloud service in China, in an apparent attempt to collect user names, passwords and other private information as the company releases its newest round of iPhones in the world’s most populous country. The attack, first reported on Monday by Greatfire.org, an activist group that monitors Internet censorship in China, was confirmed Tuesday by Apple. \\xa0The group speculated that China was hoping to collect user names and passwords for iCloud because the newest iPhones will include a strong new form of encryption that governments will have a difficult time cracking, limiting their ability to monitor the communications of its citizens. Google has also reported significantly increased levels of Chinese government interference this year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYahoo shows signs of life; might buy BrightRoll; revenue from Tumblr at $100M/year: Yahoo reported strong third-quarter financial performance on Tuesday, breaking a pattern of revenue declines and posting profits from its core operations that far exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. And mobile, long a bête noire for the company, for the first time contributed meaningfully to its results. Ms. Mayer, Yahoo’s chief executive, told investors that mobile revenue exceeded $200 million in the quarter and she expected it to top $1.2 billion for the full year. Yahoo and its Tumblr unit together had 550 million monthly users on mobile devices during the quarter, up 17 percent from a year ago.Shares of Yahoo rose 1.1 percent to $40.61 in extended trading on Tuesday. For the first time Yahoo disclosed its mobile revenue, which it said was more than $200 million in the third quarter. Yahoo said it expects that gross mobile revenues for the full year will exceed $1.2 billion. We finally have a look at Tumblr’s ad sales: $100 million in 2015.

This time, instead of taking the buyout route, Zomato launched in Canada, listing over 11,000 restaurants in the Greater Toronto area on its website as well as mobile apps.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple\\'s earnings sizzled, IBM\\'s fizzled: Apple\\'s earnings were spectacularly good (revenue at $42B, up 12% Y/Y, $8.5B in net profit, up 13% Y/Y), powered by surging iPhone sales (although the iPad continues to drag) and IBM\\'s were spectacularlybad (like Oracle and SAP, IBM is struggling to stay relevant as cloud computing gains; IBM shares are at a three year low despite billions spent on buybacks and dividend. Those buybacks are now attracting harsh criticism. IBM revenue is now about the same as it was in 2008.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Pay Insight#1: It could substantially simplify in-app purchases - potentially be a huge win for Apple (via the App Store revenues) and for Facebook (which dominates in-app ad sales) but a bummer for Google (whose Play Store business is growing increasingly important as ad revenue growth slows). Although many people only associate Apple Pay with the ability to pay at point-of-sale at a growing number of supported retailers, Apple Pay also enables in-app transactions to take place with just a touch of the finger. That means that more consumers will be able to purchase things in apps, and this will be easier than before because they’ll no longer have to remember their Apple ID and password. Instead, just by touching on the fingerprint reader on new iPhones and iPads running iOS 8, they’ll be able to pay using the credit or debit card information on file, already associated with their Apple account. (Apple already offers Touch ID for in-app purchases, but Apple Pay could enable even more types of transactions to occur easily – like ordering food or ordering an Uber, for example)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Pay Insight #2: Apple\\'s timing might be excellent (as usual): By next fall, though, American merchants face a deadline to upgrade their credit card terminals to accept E.M.V. — which stands for Europay, MasterCard and Visa — a technology that makes credit transactions more secure for consumers. Many believe those new terminals will also accept payments from Near Field Communication-enabled devices like the iPhone 6. “Apple’s timing here is an astute stroke of brilliance,” said Norm Merritt, president of ShopKeep, a start-up that sells point-of-sale products for small businesses. “People will already have to invest in new E.M.V.-enabled machines. N.F.C. is just a few bucks more.” Apple is also promoting Apple Pay’s security measures, calling it far safer than the credit cards consumers use on a daily basis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWalmart\\'s smart way of gaining audience and competitor info: a mobile app that scans competitor receipts: This summer, Walmart rolled out a new mobile app called Savings Catcher that pulls in pricing information from competitors by scanning a customer’s receipt. If a product is cheaper elsewhere, shoppers get the money back on a gift card. In addition to saving consumers money, the app also helps Walmart collect troves of data on shoppers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba is rolling out an ambitious one-stop-shop for mobile app developers in China: Alibaba claims that the range of services that it will offer to developers will be so complete that development teams will “no longer need a CTO,” in the words of Alibaba VP Wang Ruoxi, speaking at the company’s developer conference this week. “A product manager full of ideas could quickly develop an outstanding app.” (link) \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlibaba is also investing in US startups, and expanding its Cloud offering: It is signing on international and Chinese government clients for its cloud services Aliyun (link), and investing in startups in the US, such as smart-remote app maker Peel (link). The app originally essentially mimicked a hardware universal smart remote, and focused on providing that kind of experience to smartphone devices via an IR blaster, but the company has since shifted its focus to providing an intelligent remote companion that can generate custom content viewing suggestions based on viewer habits.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSnapchat started monetizing! Gently though - only non-intrusive, non-targeted ads: The firm, valued at $10B, averages 100M users/month makes an app for sharing photographs that disappear in 1 to 10 seconds. Analysts opine that while Snapchat has a high engagement, particularly among millenials, its efforts to monetize will be hampered by its reputation as a sexting app, the short attention span of its users, and the absence of any audience targeting. (This attracted wide coverage - interesting links here,here and here). Snapchat\\'s candid blog post, here, asserts that the move to display ads is simply because the firm \\'need[s] to make money\\'. The first ad was for the horror film Ouija.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary: More positive press for Pinterest; and the sad coda for two once-hot startups of 2011 that lost their way:Twitpic will shut down, and 2011 darling Tagged has officially shelved IPO plans and changed its name and business model\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitpic will shut down on October 25th: Twitpic started as one of the only ways to share photos on Twitter, allowing users to upload pics and get a URL they could post. It filled the permalinked photo pages with ads to \\xa0But then in mid-2011, Twitter revealed it would launch its own photo-hosting service, making Twitpic largely unnecessary. Despite claiming it had found an acquirer to save it from death following a trademark complaint from Twitter, the photo sharing service today announced that didn’t happen and it’s game over on October 25th. Users can now export their photos until the 25th, at which point they’ll vanish into the void.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSocial networking site Tagged is no longer going for an IPO. Instead it’s renamed itself if(we), acquired little known messaging app startup Tinode for an undisclosed amount and has completely changed direction to become a social app incubator. If(we) is essentially a brand new company, now acting as a parent brand to Tagged and social gaming site Hi5. Tagged was on a high growth course for a number of years and the money had been rolling in. According to some accounts, revenue was up 30 percent year-over-year. We reported the site was projected to grow to $45 million in revenue back in 2011. The company founders were reportedly aiming for a $1 billion IPO. Then everything shifted away from Facebook gaming and desktop sites to mobile. This is when both users and revenue began to drop off, according to sources. Co-founders Greg Tseng and Johann Schleier-Smith tried at first to shift into going mobile first, but that didn’t seem to work either. Revenue slid from $57 million last year to a projected $51 million this year, according to the San Francisco Business Times. The numbers were no longer where they needed to be for an IPO to make sense. Tagged canned the idea of going public and instead has refocused the company to mobile only. It also decided to completely rebrand with a the new name and logo and make Tagged a product offering rather than as a standalone company.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore positive press for Pinterest - which rivals Facebook in some engagement metrics and is just starting to monetize: A visual social network where people create and share image collections of recipes, hairstyles, baby furniture and just about anything else on their phones or computers, Pinterest isn’t yet five years old, but among women, who make up over 80% of its users, it’s already more popular than Twitter, which has a market capitalization of more than $30 billion. Pinterest’s U.S. user base is projected to top 40 million this year, putting it in a league with both Twitter and Instagram domestically, and it’s moving fast to catch up with them overseas, opening offices in London, Paris, Berlin and Tokyo over the past year. International users now make up nearly half of new sign-ups, according to the research firm Semiocast. Pinterest even doubled the number of active male users in the past year. To date, Pinterest’s users have created more than 750 million boards made up of more than 30 billion individual pins, with 54 million new ones added each day. During the 2013 holiday season Pinterest accounted for nearly a quarter of all social sharing activity. Among social networks, only Facebook, with its 1.3 billion users, drives more traffic to Web publishers. All that activity sounds big, but it understates the moneymaking opportunity in front of Pinterest, which will ultimately be judged by how much revenue it can wrest from its users. While it’s the earliest of days still, many analysts and observers believe that, on the basis of average revenue per user, it’s only a matter of time before Pinterest blows past Facebook, Twitter and the rest of the social pack. “They’re going to bring in billions of dollars a year,” says Dave Weinberg, founder of the social marketing company Loop88.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')\n",

For nearly two months the retailer sent a push notifications to select customers as they entered the 100 of the company’s 929 stores that are outfitted with beacons. The message offered 25 kicks — Shopkick’s rewards currency — if they tried something on in a fitting room. American Eagle found that customers that received the offer were more than twice as likely to try on clothing as those who didn’t. “That’s incredible. It’s way beyond anything I anticipated,” said Joe Megibow, chief digital officer at American Eagle Outfitters. \\xa0American Eagle Outfitters placed a beacon at the front entrance and in the fitting room of each trial store. When a customer with the Shopkick app entered the store, the beacon sensed their smartphone’s presence via Bluetooth, and triggered Shopkick to display a message offering 25 extra kicks.
